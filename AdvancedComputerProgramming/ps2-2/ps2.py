# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Problem 2a: Designing your graph
#
# What do the graph's nodes represent in this problem? What
# do the graph's edges represent? Where are the distances
# represented?
#
# Answer: The nodes represent the buildings, and the edges
#         represent there exists a road between one building to another.
#         The distance represent how far getting from the
#         source building to the destination.

# Problem 3: Finding the Shorest Path using Optimized Search Method
#
# Problem 3a: Objective function
#
# What is the objective function for this problem? What are the constraints?
#
# Answer:
# The objective function is to minimize the distance from one given building to another.
# The constraint is not to exceed the maximum distance outdoors.
