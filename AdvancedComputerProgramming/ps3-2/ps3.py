# === Problem 6
#
# ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
#
# 1)How does the performance of the two robot types compare when cleaning 80%
#       of a 20x20 room?
# Answer: The StandardRobot performs better than the FaultyRobot all the time.
#         The plotted figure shows that the time of StandardRobot to clean 80% of a
#         20x20 room always smaller than the FaultyRobot, no matter how many robots
#         are assigned.
#
# 2) How does the performance of the two robot types compare when two of each
#       robot cleans 80% of rooms with dimensions 
#       10x30, 20x15, 25x12, and 50x6?
# Answer: When the aspect ratio increases, both time of the robots increase (though
#         decrease at the very beginning). The room is so large (300-tile) that the
#         StandardRobot performs much better than the FaultyRobot. Several hundreds of
#         steps are needed to finish the cleaning for the FaultyRobot.
#         Thus, making the robots not faulty is very important for performance improving!
