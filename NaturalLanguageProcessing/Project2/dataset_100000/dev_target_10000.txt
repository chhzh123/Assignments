In exchange for forfeiting control over their budgets, Schäuble offers France and Italy – the primary targets of his plan – the promise of a small eurozone-wide common budget that would partly fund unemployment and deposit-insurance schemes.
Such a disciplinarian, minimalist political union does not go down well in France, where elites have always resisted forfeiting sovereignty.
While politicians like Macron have moved a long way toward accepting the need to transfer powers over national budgets to the “center,” they fear that Schäuble’s plan asks too much and offers too little: severe limits on France’s fiscal space and a macroeconomically insignificant common budget.
But even if Macron could persuade Hollande to accept Schäuble’s plan, it is not clear whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel would consent to it.
Schäuble’s ideas have so far failed to persuade her or, indeed, the Bundesbank (which, through its president, Jens Weidmann, has been hugely negative toward any degree of fiscal mutualization, even the limited version that Schäuble is willing to trade for control over the French and Italian budgets).
Caught between a reluctant German chancellor and an indisposed France, Schäuble imagined that the turbulence caused by a Greek exit from the eurozone would help persuade the French, as well as his cabinet colleagues, of his plan’s necessity.
Now, while waiting for the current Greek “program” to collapse under the weight of its inherent contradictions, Germany’s finance ministry is preparing for the battles ahead.
In September, Schäuble distributed to his Eurogroup colleagues an outline of three proposals for preventing a new euro crisis.
First, eurozone government bonds should include clauses that make it easy to “bail in” bondholders.
Second, the European Central Bank’s rules ought to be altered to prevent commercial banks from counting such bonds as ultra-safe, liquid assets.
And, third, Europe should ditch the idea of common deposit insurance, replacing it with a commitment to let banks fail when they no longer fulfill the ECB’s collateral rules.
Implementing these proposals in, say, 1999, might have limited the gush of capital to the periphery immediately following the single currency’s introduction.
Alas, in 2015, given the eurozone members’ legacy public debts and banking losses, such a scheme would cause a deeper recession in the periphery and almost certainly lead to the monetary union’s breakup.
Exasperated by Schäuble’s backtracking from his own plan for political union, Macron recently vented his frustration: “The Calvinists want to make others pay until the end of their life,” he complained.
“They want reforms with no contributions toward any solidarity.”
The most troubling aspect of Renzi’s and Macron’s statements is the hopelessness they convey.
Renzi’s defiance of fiscal rules that push Italy further into an avoidable debt-deflationary spiral is understandable; but, in the absence of proposals for alternative rules, it leads nowhere.
Macron’s difficulty is that there seems to be no set of painful reforms that he can offer Schäuble to persuade the German government to accept the degree of surplus recycling necessary to stabilize France and the eurozone.
Meanwhile, Germany’s commitment to “rules” that are incompatible with the eurozone’s survival undermines those French and Italian politicians who were, until recently, hoping for an alliance with Europe’s largest economy.
Some, like Renzi, respond with acts of blind rebellion.
Others, like Macron, are beginning gloomily to accept that the eurozone’s current institutional framework and policy mix will ultimately lead either to a formal breakup or to a death by a thousand cuts, in the form of continued economic divergence.
The silver lining in the gathering storm cloud is that minimalist proposals for political union, like Schäuble’s plan, are losing ground.
Nothing short of macroeconomically significant institutional reforms will stabilize Europe. And only a pan-European democratic alliance of citizens can generate the groundswell needed for such reforms to take root.
Germany’s Golden Opportunity
BERLIN – The German economy appears unstoppable.
Output is expected to grow by more than 2% this year, and wages by 3%, with the current-account surplus set to reach a towering 8.4% of GDP.
Unemployment has been halved over the last decade, and now stands at an all-time low.
German exporters remain highly innovative and competitive.
And the government is recording a sizeable budget surplus.
While the rest of Europe remains mired in crisis and self-doubt, Germany’s future seems bright and secure.
But appearances can be deceiving.
In fact, today’s rosy macroeconomic data tell only part of the story.
Since the euro was established in 1999, Germany’s productivity growth has been no more than average among European countries, real wages have declined for half the workforce, and annual GDP growth has averaged a disappointing 1.2%.
A key reason for this lackluster performance is Germany’s notoriously paltry investment rate, which is among the lowest in the OECD.
The result is deteriorating infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and schools.
This, together with an inadequate regulatory and business environment, has raised concerns among companies; since 1999, the largest German multinationals have doubled their employee headcounts abroad, while cutting jobs at home.
In their 2013 coalition agreement, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats set a goal of raising public and private investment by 3% of GDP, or €90 billion ($100.8 billion) annually, to reach the OECD average.
Although this is not a particularly ambitious objective – after all, Germany’s current-account surplus at the time amounted to 7.8% GDP – achieving it is vital to the country’s continued prosperity.
Last August, the German government appointed a 21-member committee of experts (including the three authors) from business, labor unions, finance, and academia to determine how to achieve the target.
Last month, the committee presented its ten-point action plan, which, despite disagreement on taxes and private financing of public investment, reflects an unusually broad consensus.
For starters, the action plan calls for limiting the impact on public investment of the pressure to consolidate the government budget.
The plan does not challenge the constitutional debt brake that forbids the federal government from running structural deficits above 0.35% of GDP.
But it does recommend a legally binding commitment to keep investment levels at least as high as the rate of depreciation of state assets, and to use unexpected budget surpluses, first and foremost, for increased public investment.
In order to support local investment, the expert committee proposes creating a “national investment pact” to enable municipalities to increase investment by at least €15 billion over the next three years.
And it recommends establishing a public advisory institution to help municipalities realize their investment projects, of which there is currently a €118 billion backlog.
The most controversial issue, within the committee and in Germany, relates to financing infrastructure via public-private partnerships, a seemingly promising solution that nonetheless has proved to be far from a panacea.
To strike an effective balance, the action plan proposes two publicly owned investment funds – one raising money from institutional investors, and the other from individuals.
The public projects financed by the funds would provide sufficient efficiency gains to attract private financing.
As for purely private-sector investment, the committee recommends a focus on developing the sectors that will dominate tomorrow’s economy.
As it stands, Germany is strong in traditional industrial sectors, but has fallen behind its competitors in Asia and the United States in terms of investment in research and development.
To catch up, R&amp;D spending should be raised from less than 3% to at least 3.5% of GDP.
Nowhere is the need to overcome financing bottlenecks more apparent than with Germany’s Energiewende (energy transition).
To succeed, more than €30 billion, or 1% of GDP, will have to be invested annually in network infrastructure, renewable-energy generation, combined heat and power systems, and storage technologies in the coming decades.
While some of these funds will come from public budgets, the vast majority will have to be provided by the private sector.
Moreover, bringing Germany’s digital infrastructure, especially its broadband networks, up to international standards will require significant investment, which an improved regulatory framework could help to encourage.
Regulatory reform is also needed to strengthen support for startup companies – an area in which Germany is notoriously weak, reflected in the difficulties such companies face in obtaining venture capital.
A substantial increase in private investment is necessary not just for Germany; it is critical to Europe’s recovery from its ongoing crisis.
Given Germany’s relative economic strength, it has a special responsibility to help foster investment throughout Europe, including by promoting European-level reforms of transport and energy, supporting incentives for innovation, and backing digital modernization.
The expert committee supports EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s plan to channel some €300 billion of private-sector money toward infrastructure, and proposes that if the scheme is successful, it should be transformed into a permanent European investment mechanism.
This would require more funding in the long run for the European Fund for Strategic Investments, to which the German government should contribute directly.
Germany’s combination of strong growth, low unemployment, favorable financing conditions, and large budget surpluses present it with a golden opportunity.
With increased investment in infrastructure, not to mention a competitive education system and more investment-friendly business conditions, it can place its economy on a stronger footing for the future, and help pull Europe out of its malaise.
We now have a plan; all that is needed is the will to implement it.
Germany’s Four Neins
BERLIN – Germany’s stance toward Europe has become one of rejection and disengagement.
Its policymakers deny the eurozone’s crisis-ridden countries a more active fiscal policy; refuse to support a European investment agenda to generate demand and growth; have declared a fiscal surplus, rather than faster potential growth, as their primary domestic goal; and have begun turning against the European Central Bank (ECB) in the struggle against deflation and a credit crunch.
On all four counts, Germany is wrong.
To be sure, Germany is justified in rejecting narrow-minded calls by France and Italy for unconditional fiscal expansion.
After all, fiscal stimulus can work only if it supports private investment and is accompanied by much more ambitious structural reforms – the kind of reforms that France and Italy are currently resisting.
But Germany has all of the leverage it needs to implement the stability-oriented reforms that it wants for Europe.
For starters, Germany, together with the European Commission, can compel France to pursue deeper reforms in exchange for more time to consolidate its deficit.
Germany cannot, however, indulge its obsession with supply-side reforms without also pursuing growth-enhancing policies.
As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s, the benefits of supply-side reforms – namely, improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates – take a long time to emerge.
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have.
With every month that the economy loses productive capacity, the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises.
The key to ending the European crisis is a stimulus plan that addresses deficiencies on both the supply and demand sides.
That is why Germany’s refusal to help find a way to finance the proposed European investment agenda – which, for a limited time, would fund productive private investment – is a mistake.
Equally problematic is Germany’s focus on maintaining a fiscal surplus.
With projections for German GDP growth this year and next revised downward by more than 0.6 percentage points in the last few months, the government could be forced to initiate a pro-cyclical fiscal policy to achieve its goal, inducing even lower growth at home and throughout the eurozone.
Given that the German economy’s output gap remains negative, the government should be implementing expansionary fiscal policy that targets the country’s infrastructure weaknesses.
In this sense, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s plan to spend an additional €10 billion ($12.5 billion) on public investment in 2016-2018 is a step in the right direction.
But, at just 0.1% of Germany’s annual GDP, Schäuble’s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift.
Germany’s fourth policy mistake is its apparent withdrawal of support for the ECB.
Over the last seven years, the ECB’s actions have helped Germany’s economy and taxpayers as much as those of its neighbors.
Moreover, the claim that the ECB’s purchases of asset-backed securities amount to “toxic loans” that transfer risk to German taxpayers is unfounded; after all, there have been almost no defaults since 2008.
Germany’s leaders need to recognize this – and to defend the ECB publicly from baseless fear mongering.
Failure to do so may reflect an effort to forestall the rise of the far-right anti-European political forces, particularly the Alternative for Germany.
But this strategy merely plays into the party’s hands.
If Germany refuses to take a more reasoned approach, it risks undermining the ECB’s credibility, thereby reducing the effectiveness of its measures.
If that happens, the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called “outright monetary transactions” scheme – a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose.
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone.
And it has the authority to bolster the ECB’s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion.
Europe needs a grand bargain, involving close coordination on structural reforms and fiscal and monetary policy.
Germany’s relative economic and political stability, far from enabling it to disengage from such efforts, makes it among the most important protagonists in their development and implementation.
The question is whether Germany’s leaders will recognize this before Europe’s economy falls into an even deeper slump.
Getting Bank Culture Right
WASHINGTON, DC – Banks and banking rely on trust.
But while trust takes years to establish, it can be squandered abruptly if a particular bank’s ethics are weak, its values poor, and its behavior simply wrong.
The events that triggered the 2008 global financial crisis, together with the subsequent scandals that have emerged – from the rigging of the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to sanctions-busting and money-laundering – amount to a catalog of cultural failures within our financial institutions.
Yes, extensive measures have been taken since the crisis to strengthen the financial system.
But a profound weakness remains: To be blunt, it concerns the risk-taking culture that still prevails within some departments of global banks and in the financial system itself.
Too often, bank bosses’ promises to change the “corporate culture” and ensure their employees’ good conduct have not been matched by fully effective implementation.
In too many cases, banks are still failing to fulfill their obligations in serving their communities and the public at large.
It is true that the banking sector is paying a high price for its misdeeds: fines, litigation, and regulatory tightening have cost approximately $300 billion so far.
But the tax-paying public – innocent of any wrongdoing – has also had to bear costs, both direct and indirect.
And, while a handful of “rogue traders” (and, most recently, one Libor manipulator) have ended up in prison, it would be overly optimistic to conclude that the punishment has been sufficient to transform bank culture.
If banks and other financial institutions are to perform their crucial role in providing support for growth and employment, it is imperative that they take steps to regain the public’s trust.
But how?
More regulation is not necessarily the best path forward: The rules and norms that define a “right” and “wrong” culture are beyond the wit of regulators and supervisory bodies.
But the pressure to devise such rules is bound to mount if banks do not demonstrate that they are grappling effectively with the challenge of cultural change.
Sadly, until now, many banks have adopted an unconvincing piecemeal approach.
It is not enough to strengthen legal compliance.
A new report published by the Group of Thirty argues that banks must do far more.
Real change must go to the core of an institution’s day-to-day operations.
Banks must change compensation practices that reward excessive risk; protect whistleblowers; recruit and train staff to reflect proper ethics; and ensure that their boards of directors play a more active oversight role.
(I believe that if boards had been aware of the egregious behavior being perpetrated within some institutions, from product mis-selling to price-fixing, they would have acted to stop it.)
Let me be clear: Setting values and shaping an organizational culture take a long time and a great deal of work.
Successful reform requires changing people’s mindset and habituating them to self-regulation.
A written code – emphasizing the commercial benefits of ethical business conduct, and the negative consequences of falling short – is part of that effort and may help preserve and strengthen a culture; but a code alone is not enough.
Constant reminders and repetition are essential.
Employees must understand instinctively what may be done and what should never be done.
They must internalize a culture that values strict adherence to high ethical standards of conduct.
To that end, banks should make their values and culture integral to their hiring, firing, and promotion decisions.
Indeed, the values and conduct of a bank’s risk-takers should account for 50% of their annual performance review.
Failing to live up to a bank’s desired cultural norms should have an impact on an employee’s career – and, when necessary, end it.
Banking regulators and supervisors also have a decisive role to play.
They need to work with boards and senior management to ensure that major reforms are implemented and then consistently applied.
Regular exchanges of views between oversight officials and the banks should be regarded as a crucial component of this process.
Central bankers have been dismayed by many banks’ failure to move forward decisively to address the difficult internal issues of conduct and culture.
And now the concerns have grown to the point that delay is no longer an option.
Either the banks reform themselves, or public authorities will intervene still further.
Getting Corruption Right
NEW YORK – I just returned from India, where I was lecturing to the Indian Parliament in the same hall where US President Barack Obama had recently spoken.
The country was racked by scandal. A gigantic, ministerial-level scam in the mobile-telephone sector had siphoned off many billions of dollars to a corrupt politician.
But several of the MPs had also been taken aback on discovering that when Obama spoke to them, he read from an “invisible” teleprompter.
This had misled his audience into thinking that he was speaking extemporaneously, a skill that is highly regarded in India.
Both episodes were seen as a form of corruption: one involved money, the other deception.
The two transgressions are obviously not equal in moral turpitude.
But the Obama episode illustrates an important cross-cultural difference in assessing how corrupt a society is.
Transparency International and occasionally the World Bank like to rank countries by their degree of corruption, with the media then ceaselessly citing where each country stands.
But cultural differences between countries undermine the legitimacy of such rankings – which are, after all, based on surveys of the public.
What Obama was doing was a common enough practice in the United States (though one might expect better from an orator of his ability); it was not so in India, where such a technique is, indeed, regarded as reprehensible.
India certainly has corruption, like almost every other country.
But India also has a culture in which people commonly assume that everyone in public life is corrupt unless they prove otherwise.
Even a blind man will tell Transparency International: “I saw him take a bribe with my own eyes.”
Indeed, a distinguished Indian bureaucrat, a man of unimpeachable character, once told me that his mother had told him: “I believe you are not corrupt only because you are my son!”
So, if you ask Indians whether their governance is marked by widespread corruption, they will answer with gusto: yes!
But their exuberance biases India’s global ranking relative to more empirically minded countries.
A similar bias arises from the occasional tendency to view political patronage elsewhere as being more corrupt than the same practices at home.
For example, when the East Asian financial crisis broke out, there followed a systematic attempt to pin the blame on the affected countries: “crony capitalism” allegedly had somehow crippled their economies!
In other words, the acquaintances and benefactors of the East Asian leaders were “cronies,” whereas those of US leaders were “friends”?
In fact, it was clear that the culprits were the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury, which had encouraged a shift to capital-account convertibility without understanding that the case for free capital flows was not symmetrical with the case for free trade.
But where substantial corruption can unambiguously be found, as it often can, one must recognize that it is not a cultural given.
On the contrary, often it is the result of policies that have fed it.
India in the 1950’s had a civil service, and a political class, that were the envy of the world.
If that seems shocking today, the loss of virtue must be traced to the all-pervasive “permit raj,” with its licensing requirements to import, produce, and invest, which grew to gargantuan proportions.
High-level bureaucrats quickly discovered that licenses could be bartered for favors, while politicians saw in the system the means to help important financial backers.
Once the system had taken root, corruption percolated downward, from senior bureaucrats and politicians, who could be bribed do what they were not supposed to do, to lower-level bureaucrats, who would not do what there were supposed to do unless bribed.
Clerks would not bring out files, or get you your birth certificate or land title, unless you greased their palms.
But if policies can create corruption, it is equally true that the cost of corruption will vary with the specific policies.
The cost of corruption has been particularly high in India and Indonesia, where policies created monopolies that earned scarcity rents, which were then allocated to officials’ family members.
Such “rent-creating” corruption is quite expensive and corrosive of growth.
By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.
In the long run, of course, both types of corruption are corrosive of the respect and trust that good governance requires, which can undermine economic performance in its own right.
But that does not absolve us of the responsibility to define corruption properly – and to acknowledge obvious and important cultural differences in how it is understood.
Getting Investment in Europe Right
PARIS – The European Commission’s new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has put public investment back on the agenda with his idea of a three-year €300 billion ($378 billion) capital spending plan.
The European Union’s leaders are expected to discuss his proposal in December.
Everyone seems to agree that more investment would help to strengthen a worryingly feeble European economy.
But, behind the superficial consensus, many questions remain unanswered.
For starters, this is not the first time that Europe has considered such an initiative.
In 1993, the Commission, under Jacques Delors, proposed a capital spending plan in its White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment.
The plan was broadly endorsed, but no action was taken.
Likewise, in 2000, as part of its Lisbon Strategy, the EU sought to increase national spending on research and development to 3% of GDP.
It failed to reach this target.
More recently, in June 2012, EU leaders adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs that was supposed to mobilize €120 billion.
The check is still in the mail.
It is indeed easy to pretend to act without taking effective action.
One way is to ask the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU’s development bank, to lend more.
Such calls face two limitations: the EIB itself is careful not to jeopardize its financial rating by taking on too much risk, and its loans easily substitute for private financing.
More lending therefore can be pointless if it results in the EIB crowding out private financing of the best available projects.
A bridge financed by the EIB may be more affordable than one financed by capital markets, but it remains the same bridge and has the same economic impact.
The size of the EIB’s balance sheet is not a good measure of its effectiveness.
Instead, three investment levers should be used.
The first lever is budgetary: Governments that enjoy fiscal space should spend on economically sound projects.
Public investment is a complement to private investment; if designed and targeted well, it can trigger more private investment, rather than crowding it out.
For example, adequate transport and broadband infrastructure favors the burgeoning of business initiatives.
At a time when markets are willing to lend to solvent governments at historically low rates, there should be little room for hesitation.
Obviously, cheap financing does not justify public investment in projects with dubious social returns, or what development practitioners call “white elephants”: headline-grabbing projects of disputable value but supported by special interests.
Investments should be assessed on the basis of their overall economic impact, with proper procedures put in place to prevent public money from being wasted.
The second lever for investment is regulatory in nature.
Many large-scale investments that only pay off over the long term – for example, in energy, digital infrastructure, and transport – are concentrated in state-regulated sectors, giving governments the power to influence business decisions.
Predictability regarding the future course of regulation would unlock projects held back by uncertainty.
A credible outlook for the price of carbon, for example, would prompt new private-sector investment in cleaner technologies.
Similarly, an agreed European framework for projects that connect countries would remove obstacles to cross-border investment.
These conditions are a long way from being met, which means that profitable investments are not being made.
Changing that would not cost a single euro; it requires only political resolve.
The third lever is financial.
Investment demand has slackened not because interest rates are too high, but because there is not enough risk appetite within the banking system.
Financing in continental Europe is traditionally bank-based, unlike in the US, where capital markets reign supreme.
But banks are being told by regulators to reduce their leverage and to post higher capital when they embark on risky lending, and their creditors are being told that they should not expect to be bailed out if banks get into trouble.
This is intentional.
Governments and citizens in Europe have paid – and are still paying – an astronomically high price for the reckless lending and investment of the 2000s.
Understandably, they do not want to repeat the experience.
The consequence, however, is that high-risk, high-return projects are more difficult to finance than they should be.
If Europe wants to revive its economy and escape stagnation, it needs entrepreneurs to take more risk to innovate.
But its financial system is undergoing a transition from a bank-based to a market-based system that involves risk aversion.
This is where the public side – both national governments and the EU – should step in and share some of the risk with private players.
They should temporarily behave more like investors who scrutinize projects, contribute funding, and earn returns.
Using the EIB and national development banks to this end would help overcome the current impasse.
Would these three types of initiatives add up to €300 billion?
No one knows at this stage.
But this route would be the surest way to reach the goal.
Getting Migration Governance Right
DHAKA – At last year’s United Nations General Assembly summit, world leaders promised to cooperate on ensuring safe, orderly, regular, and responsible migration.
This year, they need to do more to realize that pledge.
UN member states have acknowledged migration’s many benefits, including its role in stabilizing global labor markets, spreading knowledge and ideas, creating diasporas that spur increased trade and investment, and sustaining economies worldwide through remittances, which pay for family members’ health care, education, and housing back home.
But these benefits are easily squandered if, as we’ve seen recently with crises in the Mediterranean Sea, the Andaman Sea, the Central American corridor, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, migration is not governed responsibly and cooperatively.
More than 4,300 migrants have died this year trying to reach their destinations.
In the Mediterranean Sea alone, 3,200 people have perished, and in the Andaman Sea, just east of the Bay of Bengal, thousands of migrants have been stranded on boats with nowhere to land, or have been held hostage by their traffickers.
Against this backdrop, UN member governments should acknowledge the gap between the ideals they espoused last year and the harsh realities many migrants and refugees continue to face today.
World leaders can rectify this at this month’s General Assembly meeting – and specifically at today’s unprecedented summit on migration and refugees.
World leaders should first renew their commitment to stronger global governance of migration, and agree to hold a first-ever intergovernmental conference in 2018 to focus exclusively on creating a new global compact on migration, as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proposed earlier this year.
The mere possibility that UN member states may settle on a new global compact is a significant development.
For far too long, the international community has struggled to govern migration effectively.
Without global-governance institutions and legal frameworks to guide international cooperation, most countries must resort to unilateral management of their own migration flows.
When states fail to govern migration effectively, they create a vacuum that is filled by unscrupulous actors: smugglers, traffickers, and organized-crime.
Meanwhile, countries, migrants, and host communities all lose out as they bear the costs of migration without realizing its benefits.
The UN currently is falling short of providing effective support to member states, migrants, and the societies that host them.
Its member governments need to agree on universal principles to establish an international framework for dealing with migration, and the UN itself should make governance of migration one of its central missions, rather than scattering the task across different agencies.
Fortunately, the International Organization for Migration will join the UN system today.
The IOM is expected to play a leading role in making migration governance more coherent and efficient.
My own country, Bangladesh, initiated the idea of a global compact specifically to improve migration governance.
As the current Chair of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, Bangladesh is committed to ensuring that the lessons learned inform the global compact.
But, to avoid entering into new agreements that merely re-state or re-negotiate existing commitments, world leaders must act now to lay the institutional and legal groundwork for operationalizing previous proposals and make further progress.
International cooperation on migration should be founded on existing intergovernmental agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the 2013 Declaration of High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development.
Migration is a multidimensional issue; it requires a comprehensive approach that also respects existing national laws and regulations.
Policymakers should maximize migration’s economic benefits; facilitate legal channels so that migrants don’t choose illegal alternatives; reduce barriers for employment and remittances; manage irregular migration flows; and protect migrants’ safety, especially in war zones or when migration reaches crisis levels, as it has this year.
Countries and nongovernmental organizations must remain vigilant against exploitation of migrants, and governments should share responsibility for accommodating refugees.
And, to keep up with rapidly changing geopolitical conditions, the international community should consider new partnerships in addressing migration and large movements of people.
Finally, effective migration governance requires institutional and legal frameworks that can reconcile sometimes-conflicting considerations.
For example, countries’ national interest in maintaining their sovereignty, controlling their borders, and enforcing their domestic laws must be balanced against migrants’ human rights, their legitimate desire to improve their lives, and societies’ need for immigrants and increased diversity.
By addressing all of these concerns together, the international community can uphold the principle of shared prosperity through shared responsibility, which is at the heart of the UN’s 2030 sustainable development agenda.
The time has come to set the world on a new path of constructive cooperation, instead of populists’ preferred path of destructive unilateralism.
We need only recognize that migration benefits us all to maximize the gains and minimize the pain.
Getting Past the American Election
The pundits have now weighed in mightily in interpreting the American presidential election.
Did the outcome - together with Republican gains in the Congress - represent an endorsement of Bush's positions?
Has the American electorate swung to the right?
Are Americans now more concerned about "values?"
Like price in economics, a single electoral choice compresses a lot of information.
It is a summary of whether, taking everything into account, a citizen prefers one candidate to another.
A host of surveys is required to figure out what it really means, for the United States - and for the world.
This much is clear, however: there is little confidence in Bush's economic policies.
The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago, and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration.
But while Bush was not held back four years ago by the lack of a popular mandate in pushing his agenda, he may be emboldened by the seeming ringing endorsement to push even harder - such as making the tax cuts permanent and partially privatizing social security.
If adopted, these measures will further compound America's fiscal mess.
To the rest of the world, these are America's problems.
Yes, the soaring deficits may contribute somewhat to international financial instability.
Real interest rates may rise, as America borrows more and more.
If declining confidence in US fiscal policy leads to a weaker dollar, Europe and Asia may find it more difficult to export, and if the deficits prove a drag on the American economy, global growth may stall.
But for much of the rest of the world, the real concern is American unilateralism.
An interconnected world needs cooperation and collective action.
Historically, the US has exercised enormous leadership in a world committed to the proposition that no state should dictate collective decisions.
Unfortunately, over the past four years, America's president has lost the credibility necessary to exercise that leadership.
Even if the 59 million votes cast for Bush represented a ringing endorsement of his Iraq policy, it would not restore America's international credibility.
I believe most Americans reject Bush's unilateralism no less than his administration's economic policies.
Before the invasion of Iraq, they wanted America to go to the UN, and today they recognize that America alone cannot maintain order in the Middle East.
Even if Iraq is to bear more of the cost of its own reconstruction, there will have to be debt forgiveness, and this too requires international cooperation.
Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture, or the misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda, as those abroad.
But they do not want America alone to shoulder the burdens of international peace, and they are gradually coming to the realization that leadership and cooperation do not come automatically, simply because America is the only superpower.
Some worry whether Bush will use his electoral mandate to engage in more ventures.
As he himself put it, "I earned capital in the campaign … and now I intend to spend it."
Had the Iraq venture been more successful, these worries would have been justified.
There is little secret that there were discussions concerning Iran.
But the doctrine of preemptive war has been badly tarnished, and I remain hopeful that Congress and the American people have learned a painful lesson.
Peace will not quickly be restored to Iraq, and it is hard to conceive of opening up a major new front, when America can hardly manage what it has already undertaken.
Others will, of course, have to continue to bear the costs of the mistaken and mismanaged adventure in Iraq.
Instability in the Middle East will continue to limit oil supplies, discouraging the expansion of production.
High oil prices will dampen global growth in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005.
In the short run, the only response is more conservation, and America's allies should put pressure on America to conserve.
(Another reason stems from recent reports concerning the rapid melting of the polar ice cap, which seem to reconfirm worries about global warming.)
Presidents do make a difference, but every president operates within constraints.
The good news is that the constraints that Bush and the American government will face in the next four years will almost surely limit the damage they will cause.
The rhetoric and posturing, the lack of commitment to human rights or democratic processes, may be - and should be - upsetting, but there will be far more bark than bite.
While America may continue on a path of unilateralism, other countries' stance will make a difference.
Some suggest that the US constitution provided fewer constraints on the president in the conduct of foreign policy, because the requisite checks and balances were to be provided by the powers of the time - Britain and France.
Today, with the US as the only superpower, it is even more important for countries to stand up and express their views - and to stick by them even when pressured.
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US.
But long-term relationships are based on friendship and respect; coherent, well-argued positions will earn that respect.
Today, many Americans, especially the young, feel far more respect for the countries that recognized the lack of evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction than for those whose leaders repeated the American distortions.
It may be unfortunate that Realpolitik is the order of the day, but it is, so others must learn to play the same game.
Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do; it is also in the interests of America's allies and, ultimately, America itself.
Getting Practical in Controlling Malaria
Many international assistance programs fail because they are badly designed and/or too complicated.
The result is that the poor don’t get the help they need, and taxpayers in rich countries lose confidence in the use of their aid funds.
A case in point has been malaria control.
If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria, they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens.
Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes.
It depends on warm temperatures, and thus is largely a tropical malady.
Africa turns out to be especially unlucky, because it has a combination of high temperatures and the mosquitos that are likely to transmit the disease.
As a result, Africa accounts for 90% of all malaria deaths in the world – including roughly two million children per year.
Yet even in Africa, Malaria is largely preventable and completely treatable at low cost.
Up until now, there has been far too little malaria control.
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets, which are treated with insecticide.
These nets cover people while they sleep, and repel or kill the mosquitoes, which tend to bite during the night.
The nets reduce the number of bites, and the amount of illness, but they do not eliminate them.
If people get bitten despite the nets, they require treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.
There are two major obstacles to solving the malaria problem.
First, Africa’s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines.
Many end up taking cheap medicines that are not effective because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to them.
Second, African villagers lack access to cars or trucks, so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic.
An infected child is often dead or comatose by the time a mother reaches a clinic.
If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency, they could support simple and practical solutions: bed nets and timely access to medicine.
Rich countries would buy bed nets from companies that produce them and work with African governments to distribute them free of charge to every African household.
And they would work with African governments to ensure that the correct medicines are available for quick use within each village.
There are one billion people living in rich donor countries, and the total cost of comprehensive malaria control in Africa – giving bed nets at no cost to all Africans, and providing the right medicines within every village – is around $2.5 billion per year, or just $2.50 per citizen of the rich countries.
But the rich countries have instead adopted failed strategies.
Rather than giving away bed nets, rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor, albeit at heavily discounted prices.
This policy reflects a shortsighted ambition to promote markets rather than the direct and over-riding goals of saving lives and removing bottlenecks to long-term economic development.
The tragic result has been extremely low use of nets throughout most of Africa, since impoverished people lack the purchasing power to buy nets.
Second, donor governments have failed to promote simple ways to ensure the availability of medicines in villages across the continent.
Rather than shipping medicines to each country on the basis of estimated needs, donor agencies have set up a complicated purchasing system that has led to years of delay in getting medicines to the villages.
The pharmaceutical industry, led by Novartis, has been way ahead of donor agencies.
Novartis has agreed to make these medicines available at the cost of production.
But, despite Novartis’s large production capacity, donor agencies have failed to order, buy, and ship the medicines in the required amounts.
Malaria control now faces a period of increasing urgency, as well as renewed hope.
Malaria is spreading, and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria.
But there is also a growing realization that malaria is a disaster that must be addressed.
US President George W. Bush has launched an important new initiative to help 15 African countries to control malaria, and hosted an unprecedented White House summit in December to rally private-sector support.
Similarly, the Chinese government, the World Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank have recently announced plans to scale up their contributions to the fight against malaria.
A major new citizens’ initiative called Malaria No More is raising private funds to distribute anti-malaria nets.
People across Africa have shown that they are ready to mobilize their efforts if we offer practical means to help them.
The world’s safety, including the safety of people living in rich countries, depends on the global community’s ability to prove that it will come to the aid of all who are in desperate need.
Aid can work wonders if it is practical and directed to those in need.
Malaria control can demonstrate this world-saving lesson once again.
Getting Serious About Global Poverty
Institutions and governments, like people, make bold resolutions at the beginning of every year.
But, for the millions who face the crushing burden of poverty, mere proclamations that help is on the way are not enough to create jobs or foster development.
This year, the international community must move decisively from pledges to action in the effort to reduce poverty.
What will this require?
In 2005, the international community renewed its commitments to help the poorest countries meet the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), which aim to halve poverty by 2015.
These commitments include significant increases in debt relief and aid.
While there has been progress on implementing debt-relief measures, the international community must follow through on the other part of its pledge, by delivering increased aid and promoting its better use.
Multilateral lenders have long understood the importance of debt relief to poverty reduction.
Indeed, the joint IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched in 1996 to coordinate efforts by multilateral organizations and governments to reduce poor countries’ debt burdens to sustainable levels.
So far, the results are encouraging.
Before the HIPC Initiative, eligible countries spent, on average, slightly more on debt service than on health and education combined.
Now, debt in the 28 countries for which relief has been approved has declined by an average of two-thirds, while their expenditures on health, education, and other social services have risen to almost four times the amount of debt-service payments.
In 2005, the international community went further, agreeing on the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which will write off 100% of many poor countries’ debts to the IMF, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank.
As a result, just this past December, the IMF approved immediate, full relief for 19 countries – including 13 in Africa, four in Latin America, and two in Asia – on all outstanding debt to the Fund disbursed before January 1, 2005.
Other countries are eligible, and the IMF is helping these states make rapid progress to qualify, with total debt relief expected to be more than $5 billion.
As with the HIPC Initiative of which it is a part, the MDRI will do more than reduce debt: it will free up resources that can be devoted to poverty reduction and economic development.
In 2006, for example, Zambia will see its debt fall by almost 10% of GDP, leaving more resources available for development.
Similarly, Guyana will have its debt reduced by more than 8% of GDP.
The level of debt relief will be even greater once the World Bank and the African Development Bank finalize their own programs in the months ahead.
Nevertheless, the debt relief now being implemented will only provide a small part of the assistance, both financial and technical, that low-income countries need to meet the MDG’s.
If they are to be met, donors must also deliver on their commitments for significant increases in aid.
The IMF has long called on donors to meet the internationally accepted target for overseas development assistance of 0.7% of GDP.
Some donors have now promised to do so, though only over time; others are not ready to go that far, but have promised more aid than they currently give.
The international community must show that it will follow through on these promises.
Donors must provide the help that developing countries urgently need.
At the same time, we must ensure that low-income countries use debt relief and aid efficiently.
One priority is to ensure that large, new infusions of aid do not produce unintended economic outcomes, such as rapid currency appreciation or inflation, which would make recipient countries’ exports less competitive.
Another priority is to ensure that low-income countries that are striving to meet the MDG’s, and which have large financing requirements, avoid a new spiral of indebtedness.
The gains from MDRI debt relief will amount to precious little if low-income countries emerge from their debt burdens only to start the cycle anew by amassing fresh debt.
But recipient countries must complement donor efforts, and continue to do their part as well, by maintaining a track record of reform and sound macroeconomic policies, and by making the best possible use of the higher levels of assistance.
Outside efforts can help reduce poverty, but it is, ultimately, the efforts of low-income countries themselves to sustain strong economic performance, improve governance, and develop stable and effective institutions that will have the most important impact on reducing poverty.
Low-income countries can also improve their prospects by strengthening their fiscal management, fostering private-sector development, and liberalizing trade.
If we keep our promises, 2006 can be a year of hope for those who have little else than the dream of a better life.
Getting Serious in Russia\u0027s War on Terror
Russia's decision to spend an extra 157 billion rubles (over $5 billion) to fight terrorism is a more impressive response than all the Kremlin's recent tough talk, including President Vladimir Putin's demand that more power be centralized in his hands.
Indeed, after the hostage crisis in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002, the same sort of harsh words flowed, but no extra money was spent.
These new billions do seem to demonstrate renewed government resolve, but is throwing money at the war on terror enough?
The Kremlin refuses to publicly admit that today's terrorism has its roots predominantly in the Chechen war, which is now metastasizing throughout the Northern Caucasus.
Chechen fighters and their supporters demonstrate almost daily that the war continues, and countless bold pronouncements, like newly elected Chechen president Alu Alkhanov's recent assertion that "effective measures" have been found to combat terror, look like mere bloviation.
According to Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin, huge amounts of money are needed to resolve the Chechen problem.
But financial inflows into Chechnya are often more destabilizing than helpful.
President Akhmat Kadyrov, the murdered Chechen president, was right to suggest that 80% of this money ends up in the pockets of Moscow and regional firms who benefit from the Chechen conflict continuing.
So neither money nor military power alone can end the bloodshed, and diplomacy with the less militant Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov seems unlikely, for three reasons.
First, contacts between Maskhadov and a few Russian politicians haven't - at least as of yet - influenced the Kremlin's position.
Second, the subject for negotiations is unclear, because Putin has ruled out Chechen independence, and surrender by the separatists is just as unlikely.
Third, even if negotiations with less militant Chechens occur and succeed, terrorism will continue under the leadership of the religious fanatic Shamil Basaev.
The result of all this is spreading hopelessness.
The thirst for vengeance after the Beslan school massacre makes confrontation between Chechens and Ingushis increasingly possible.
Chechnya's neighboring republic, Dagestan, is witnessing increasing confrontations between radical and traditional Islamic groups, something now also seen in Kabardino-Balkaria.
Unless the Russian state develops a viable policy, fast, all of these areas threaten to become safe havens for terrorists.
What Russia needs is a political response to terror that takes into account its international dimension.
In the last four years, radical Islam has established itself in the Northern Caucasus.
This doesn't mean that all local Muslims have become jihadis.
In fact, the latter are a tiny minority.
But they are energetic, mobilized, and experienced fighters.
These people increasingly identify themselves with the global jihad, and have forged firm links with Muslim radicals in the Middle East, Southern Asia and Europe.
Russia must now follow America's lead in how to fight terror.
Since the attacks of September 2001, the United States has managed to avoid further attacks on its land.
True, the news coming from Iraq is horrible, but the US is fighting a full-blown war in Iraq; it is not engaged in a counterterrorist operation.
Russia's power structures, like those of America, must now be readied to conduct a very long struggle, entirely different from the old Soviet KGB way of suppressing dissent.
Russia's security forces need to learn to be pro-active, because the terrorists consistently seek to perfect their deadly methods.
The fight against terror turns on who will strike first; so far, the terrorists have been faster and more professional than the Russian state.
To conduct this struggle effectively, Russia must abandon two hoary stereotypes: that all terrorists are bandits, and that they somehow are acting under some Western intelligence supervision to weaken Russia.
The base of world terrorism consists of daring fanatics who believe in a sacred, fiery destiny.
Osama bin Laden doesn't work for money and wants to destroy the entire West, not weaken Russia in particular.
But the greatest obstacle that must be confronted if Russia is to wage war on terror effectively is the rampant corruption in the security forces.
It is well known, for example, that Basaev's fanatical killers paid off Russian militia to enter Budeonovsk in 1995 and kill hospital patients.
Yet nothing has been done to root out this tool of terror.
It is all too easy to reduce the fight against terrorism to tightening the political screws, to a strengthening of Putin's power, to restricting the movement of people within the country.
But none of these measures will frighten extremists in the Northern Caucasus or their al Qaeda allies.
The Kremlin must know this already.
Even Putin's predictable presidential rhetoric reveals a desire to initiate a real fight against terrorism.
But waging a serious war requires a serious reorganization of Russia's power structures, which will be very painful.
Despite Putin's so far unsuccessful fight against terrorism, his popularity remains high, so he has the political capital to make tough internal reforms.
But he must act now, for public support can be no substitute for resolute and effective action.
Getting to Yes (Again) with Germany
GENEVA – Europe’s slow-motion sovereign-debt crisis may appear unique, but it is not.
Just a few decades ago, Europe had the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which collapsed during a crisis very much akin to the one afflicting Europe today.
Will the outcome this time be different?
The ERM was an arrangement that pegged most European currencies’ exchange-rate movements within limited bands.
But ERM members’ monetary policies remained home-grown, which, no surprise, occasionally led to fiscal imbalances.
When capital markets smelled a problem among ERM members, they invariably shorted the most vulnerable currency and pushed that country’s authorities to devalue.
Authorities resisted, blamed speculators, and then, usually over a frantic few days, gave in.
Markets also tested the resolve of policymakers in otherwise sound ERM countries, particularly when there were big strikes or important elections.
In those cases, even a government with the proper economic fundamentals and its financial house in order could still run into trouble.
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet is well aware of this: in the early 1990’s, he confronted such a crisis as Governor of the Bank of France.
Some contemporary observers of the ERM thought that there was an easy fix for these troubles.
If the central bank of the country that printed its “strong currency” (Germany) had been willing to provide unlimited support to a “weak currency,” things would have been sorted out.
Germany’s Bundesbank, it was suggested, would stand ready to buy “unlimited quantities” of lire or francs, so no one would dare to short either currency.
The notion of “unlimited quantities” was important: speculators would force officials to exhaust limited quantities, with the purchasing authority (the Bundesbank) eventually bearing the loss.
Monetary support would lead to fiscal transfers, making limited interventions a non-starter.
With unlimited support, by contrast, every single speculator could be quashed, and no loss would be borne (since intervention to support a weak currency would succeed).
The only problem was that both the Bundesbank and the German government always fiercely resisted such an arrangement, on the grounds that it could lead to the printing of unlimited quantities of Deutschmarks, and thus stoke inflation.
Instead, Europe developed the euro, which solved the problem of speculative attacks and monetary credibility by replacing individual currencies with a new one.
It was impossible to short the lira or the franc because there were no more lire or francs.
But Italy and France had to give something in return for this security: the ECB was made independent of all eurozone governments.
Yet the current debt crisis has resurrected the old problem, with debt now filling the role that currencies played under the ERM.
Some eurozone countries borrowed excessively and have been punished by the markets, perhaps deservedly so, while others, in the resulting climate of anxiety, have become targets for speculators.
On July 21, eurozone leaders agreed to make “more extensive” use of the new European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) by permitting it to purchase endangered eurozone countries’ debt in secondary markets.
But the EFSF’s “more extensive interventions” recalls the “unlimited quantities” of foreign-exchange intervention proposed to rescue the ERM.
If “more extensive” means piecemeal limited commitments that will eventually be exhausted, the scheme runs the risk of creating losses (just as the Bundesbank would have suffered losses had it engaged in limited defense of weak ERM currencies).
To rule this out, “unlimited interventions” would be needed.
But with whose resources, and under whose authority?
This explains the growing excitement about issuing “Eurobonds.”
The conversion of all eurozone national bonds into obligations jointly recognized by all eurozone governments is a replica of the solution to the ERM’s breakdown, which consisted in abandoning national currencies in favor of the euro.
This would cost Germany control over the quality of its credit, just as the replacement of the Bundesbank by the ECB implied Germany’s loss of control over the quality of its currency (though it was given a large role in designing the ECB).
What is missing in today’s proposals is the equivalent of the ECB’s independence, which ensured Germany’s participation in the euro.
It is no coincidence that one of the leading opponents – the ECB’s first chief economist, Otmar Issing – of the “unlimited interventions” policy under the ERM recently rebuked both the “extended-EFSF” and Eurobonds.
The current proposals, Issing argues, are “undemocratic.”
The concessions needed to ensure German participation are likely to be enormous.
With markets’ ability to monitor dubious borrowers, the guarantees will probably have to be institutional, constitutional, and political – probably formal control over European fiscal policy by a body at least as credible as the ECB, which would mean a dramatic reduction in the power of national parliaments.
Such radical changes would require the consent of all eurozone countries.
And the Bundestag (not Standard and Poor’s) would have to be happy.
Anything short of this is bound to fail.
Getting to \
There is a wise American saying: “If you are in a hole, stop digging.”
The six governments that are currently considering the next steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany – should heed that advice.
Otherwise, they could end up without any handle on the Iranian nuclear program, and only one – useless – option left, a military strike.
Yet the six governments seem determined to continue with what has been their strategy so far.
Their condition for negotiating with Iran is a prior halt of its nuclear enrichment activities.
Only in exchange for Iran’s permanent renunciation of enrichment will they provide major rewards – from lifting all sanctions and trade restrictions to security guarantees.
This strategy has not worked and will not work.
Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of which Iran is still a member, countries are entitled to engage in enriching uranium for civilian purposes, and Iran claims that this is all it wants.
True, Iran’s total halt of its enrichment program would be welcome, not least because its government has hidden these activities for almost two decades from Treaty inspectors, suggesting other than purely civilian motives.
But the issue of enrichment has been blown up into such a symbol of national sovereignty in Iran that no government there, not only the current Achmadinejad administration, will climb down.
Indeed, when the UN Security Council formally demanded a stop to the enrichment program and imposed mild sanctions last December, Iran’s defiant answer was to increase enrichment activity.
So what to do now?
The Bush administration, predictably, is pushing for new and tougher sanctions, based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution, and arguing, as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq, that the UN’s credibility is at stake.
But the only real test of UN credibility in this conflict is whether it can succeed in restricting Iran as much as possible to a purely civilian nuclear program.
If the Security Council fails to agree on new sanctions – which is likely, given Chinese and Russian objections – it would be exposed as a paper tiger.
If, on the other hand, it works out a consensus on more economic and possibly even military punishment, the UN’s credibility would depend on whether these moves produce Iranian compliance.
That, however, is unlikely.
Tougher economic sanctions will not force Iran to comply; instead, sanctions will merely hit this oil- and gas-rich country’s trading partners.
More threats will only push the international community further along the spiral of escalation and, possibly, into military action.
There are those in Bush’s entourage who would like nothing better.
While even a major air attack would fall short of destroying all of Iran’s nuclear installations and, moreover, leave the technical know-how intact, it might at least slow down the program for a while and serve as a warning to other potential proliferators.
But it is a foolhardy gamble.
Today, Iran declares that it wants to observe the NPT, and that has no intention of building a nuclear bomb.
After a military attack by the United States, both promises would be history.
If the six governments want to avoid the escalation spiral and curb the proliferation dynamic, they need to change strategy and objective.
Instead of making a halt to uranium enrichment the be-all and end-all of their effort, their central objective should be to subject the Iranian activities to as much verification as possible: if Iran wants to enrich, so be it, but it must accept intrusive international inspections.
This is a bargain that the Iranians themselves have repeatedly hinted at.
The Six have refused because verification cannot provide an absolute guarantee against the diversion of some enriched uranium to military use.
But as the superpowers learned in the Cold War, the absence of airtight verification does not render inspections useless.
They would still submit the Iranian program to greater restrictions than is the case today.
And such an agreement would open the way to a wider agreement between Iran and the West for cooperation and regional stability.
That is why the Six should stop digging a deeper hole.
Instead of formulating new sanctions for the UN Security Council, they should use the next few months to explore confidentially what level of restrictions combined with verification Iran would consider in exchange for undisputed enrichment.
By all means, the Six should keep the option of more biting resolutions as an inducement to Iranian compromise.
But those who now call on the Security Council to issue rapid condemnations of Iran’s behavior should keep two things in mind: they are unlikely to have any effect, and the US has already used such resolutions as a pretext for launching military action on its own.
Getting to Yes With Iran
WASHINGTON, DC – With the release of America’s National Intelligence Estimate, according to which Iran has suspended its nuclear weapons program, the prospect of military confrontation with the Bush administration dimmed.
But months later, it is clear that the danger is not past, because Iran has not renounced the production of nuclear weapons, which its enriched uranium could eventually be used to fuel.
All parties need to find a formula to resolve the issue before it again threatens to erupt into conflict.
Western diplomacy in recent years has focused on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as the key to resolving the crisis.
But this approach is a blind alley.
Let us recall the fate of Ahmedinejad’s two immediate predecessors.
Muhammad Khatami (1997-2005) tried to implement dramatic political reform, while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-97) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West.
Both failed, because Iran’s presidents do not run the country.
A solution to the nuclear dilemma – or any other problem in Iran’s foreign relations – is in the hands of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
Among his responsibilities, Khamenei serves as commander-in-chief of the military, controls the intelligence services, and appoints directors of the national media.
His appointees effectively control most ministries and Iran’s major cities.
In diplomacy, Khamenei tends to operate in a clever but recognizable fashion.
He sends different diplomats into negotiations with contradictory instructions.
Each claims to be acting with the Supreme Leader’s full authority, but ultimately are unable to make commitments because they have little idea of what Khamenei wants to do.
After a time, they are removed, and a new set of representatives is dispatched.
In order to dominate decision-making, Khamenei prefers weak presidents.
Ahmedinejad is no different.
His political base has faded, owing to Iran’s deepening economic crisis, which has been intensified by the conflict with the West over the nuclear issue.
His support in the parliamentary election next March seems particularly weak, which will no doubt please Western observers.
But the election results will not matter: parliament, too, has little influence over Iran’s foreign policy.
Some Western diplomats recognize the Supreme Leader’s role.
In practice, however, Western diplomacy tends to ignore Khamenei, who sabotages any effort to get around him as the final arbiter of Iranian policy. This might partly explain why Khamenei has been mistrustful of negotiations with the West.
Westerners don’t seem to understand who is in charge.
Indeed, some analysts argue that former President Bill Clinton’s efforts to achieve a breakthrough with Iran failed because they were addressed to Iran’s presidents.
The West should learn from the example of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who did not travel to Iran until he was allowed a direct meeting with Khamenei, during which Putin is reported to have made a proposal to end the nuclear stand-off.
There has been no answer yet, though there does seem to be some recent movement between Russia and Iran on the provision of nuclear fuel for Iran’s controversial reactors.
To be sure, Khamenei is reluctant to meet with non-Muslim foreign leaders.
But that shouldn’t stop the West from reaching out to him directly, or pressing him to publicly appoint the representatives who negotiate with the West.
One American politician who understands how to work with the Iranian power structure is former Congressman Lee Hamilton, now head of the Woodrow Wilson Center.
When Wilson Center researcher Haleh Esfandiari was arrested in Iran, Hamilton wrote to Khamenei, pleading for her release on humanitarian grounds.
Khamenei responded – reportedly the first time he answered an American – and Esfandiari was released in a matter of days. 
Khamenei would be hard-pressed to ignore a direct invitation from the US to negotiate on Iran’s most vital concerns.
His clear priority is the Islamic Republic’s survival, not the fate of particular Iranian politicians.
While Ahmedinejad’s apocalyptic vision makes it difficult for westerners to deal with him, Khamenei does not want to stumble into a military confrontation with the West, which would destabilize Iran and possibly lead to the regime’s downfall.
To resolve outstanding issues with Iran, the West should be dealing with the only person powerful enough to make deals and deliver concessions.
That person is Khamenei, not Ahmedinejad.
Ghettoizing Identity
PARIS – Once, as I picked up the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen at his hotel, the receptionist asked me if I was his driver.
After hesitating, I nodded yes.
Among my various identities that day, that of driver was the most obvious to her.
This sense of multiple identities is something that Sen himself highlighted mischievously in his book Identity and Violence : “The same person can be, for example, a British citizen, of Malaysian origin, with Chinese racial characteristics, a stockbroker, a non-vegetarian, an asthmatic, a linguist, a bodybuilder, a poet, an opponent of abortion, a bird-watcher, an astrologer, and one who believes that God invented Darwin to test the gullible.”
Only a minimum of introspection shows that our difficulty in answering the question, Who am I?, arises from the complexity we face in distinguishing between our many identities and understanding their architecture.
Who am I, indeed, and why should I accept people reducing me and the richness of my identity to only one of its dimensions?
Yet such reductionism lies behind one of today’s dominant concepts, multiculturalism, according to which one of our identities must prevail above all others, serving as the sole criterion for organizing society into distinct groups.
Nowadays, we are often told that there are only two ways for people to integrate into a society: the “British” model of cultural pluralism, and the “French” model, based on acceptance of Republican values and, above all, the concept of equality.
According to the conventional wisdom, Britain’s social model is based on coexistence between different communities, with each continuing to observe its conventions and customs while respecting the country’s laws – an informal federation of communities.
But that common wisdom is grossly mistaken, because British law grants immigrants from all the Commonwealth countries something extraordinary: the right to vote in British elections, even national ones.
Citizens know by experience that democracy does not consist in universal suffrage alone, but also requires a public sphere that is equally open to all.
In the United Kingdom, a large group of immigrants thus share with native Britons the right to participate in public debates on all matters of general interest, whether local or national.
Because fundamental equality is granted in this way, the British system manages to cope better than others do with a greater expression of distinctive identities.
Nowadays, however, Britain’s government itself seems to be forgetting the bedrock conditions of this British model by trying to satisfy the desire of particular communities’ for public recognition by officially promoting things like state-subsidized denominational schools.
According to Sen, this is regrettable because it leads to people giving one of their identities – religious, say, or cultural – priority over all others at a time when it is essential that children broaden their intellectual horizons.
By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent, the British are now saying, “This is your identity and you can have nothing else.”
That approach amounts to communitarianism, not multiculturalism.
In the last few years, the “French model” has also been subjected to misinterpretation, due to confusion about its basis – genuine inclusion in the life of society, which means genuine equality in terms of access to public services, the social welfare system, schools and universities, employment, and so on.
Republicanism grants each individual, regardless of his or her other identities equal rights in order to achieve universal equality.
It does not deny distinctive identities and gives each the right to express itself within the private sphere.
The temptation of communitarianism, which the French have debated for at least a decade, comes from the wish to turn the failure of genuine equality into something positive. It offers integration by default within the differentiated space of various communities – a sort of imprisonment by civilization, Sen would say.
But you cannot dress up failure in the clothes of success.
As long as urban areas are socially and economically deprived, communitarianism will only serve to mask the violation of the principle of equality.
Social groups are then measured in terms of their “ethnic” or “racial” differences.
Because the social conditions of the “French model” have been so neglected, the model is now a living contradiction of its core principle: equality.
To reverse the trend, French republicanism must, like English multiculturalism, contradict itself in order to fulfil itself.
The French must recognize that equality before the law is a core principle, but a weak one; it needs to be complemented by a stricter vision of how to achieve equality.
This vision should make republican efforts proportional to the importance of people’s handicap in order to free them from the burden of their initial conditions.
Genuine equality in the public sphere – which differs according to the values and history of each country – implies a minimal level of acceptance of a country’s history and values.
Sen says that what is being accepted here should be thought of as national identity.
But this identity must be open.
It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common, whatever the differences between our multiples identities.
The great British novelist Joseph Conrad, born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski to Polish parents in Russian-ruled Ukraine, said that words are the biggest enemy of reality.
The appeal of “national identity” must not be turned into a collective smokescreen behind which inclusion becomes a disembodied dream coexisting with the communitarianism that is now emerging from its failure.
The IMF’s Next Test
CAMBRIDGE – In October, central bankers, policymakers, private-sector executives, academics, and representatives of civil-society organizations will convene in Washington, DC, for the annual joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Among the most important outcomes this year will be the IMF Board of Governors’ decision regarding how to address current international monetary issues.
Global economic conditions remain precarious, with no signs of healthy GDP growth in the eurozone, a weak recovery in the United States, commodity-exporting countries like Australia suffering from diminishing Chinese demand, and an emerging-market slowdown that is now well into its third year.
In such an uncertain environment, even small changes in advanced countries’ monetary policy can destabilize developing economies.
For example, the mere announcement in May that the Federal Reserve would “taper” its purchases of long-term assets drove down the value of emerging-market currencies.
With the Fed considering exiting its quantitative-easing policy altogether and raising interest rates over the next year, global markets are set to experience significant turbulence.
The world needs strategies to mitigate this looming volatility.
The IMF – whose mandate is to maintain balance-of-payments stability worldwide – should be the institution that provides them.
Rather than waiting for a crisis to erupt before intervening, the IMF should provide “forward guidance” on how it will tackle potential disruptions in international financial markets.
Central banks are increasingly using such guidance to communicate monetary policy and anchor market expectations.
For example, the Fed has pledged to keep interest rates low at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5% – a move that has arguably lowered long-term borrowing costs.
Likewise, Mark Carney, in his first policy action as Governor of the Bank of England, announced forward guidance for short-term interest rates.
Although the effect of such interest-rate guidance on the economy cannot be determined without additional data, there are many arguments in its favor.
Perhaps the most telling recent example of a central bank using forward guidance effectively was European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s July 2012 announcement that the ECB would do “whatever it takes” to ensure the euro’s survival.
That pledge alone stabilized borrowing costs and dramatically reduced interest-rate spreads for struggling eurozone countries.
Investors’ belief that the ECB would buy up government debt if bond yields rose too high was enough to restore calm; indeed, no central-bank intervention in secondary markets has been necessary since then.
The IMF’s policy tool here is the dollar amount that it is willing to pledge as a backstop in balance-of-payments crises.
By promising to intervene in vulnerable markets in the event of excessive financial volatility, the IMF, as the largest player, would reduce coordination problems among investors.
Moreover, by communicating ex ante its willingness to provide emergency funds, the IMF would reduce the stigma against countries that turn to it for assistance – a stigma that has led countries to delay requesting support until it is too late to mitigate domestic political damage.
The good news is that the IMF has already shown some interest in the idea of forward guidance.
At the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde suggested that the Fund would intervene to help emerging markets in crisis.
The bad news is that Lagarde’s vague announcement seems to have done little to shape market expectations or make governments more comfortable requesting IMF assistance.
This underscores a fundamental point: successful forward guidance requires, above all, credibility.
After the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, sparking a global financial crisis whose repercussions are still being felt, G-20 countries offered firm commitments to increase the IMF’s lending resources, thereby enabling the Fund to mitigate the effects of the crisis.
Today, G-20 leaders must again use their influence over IMF policy, this time to push for timely forward guidance and another round of reform of the international financial architecture.
The Fed’s decision in September to postpone tapering its quantitative-easing program has given emerging markets some breathing room, which they should use to bolster themselves against the inevitable reversal of easy-money inflows from the US.
This is also an opportunity for the IMF to formulate and announce its policy to address global financial market turbulence.
To be sure, there is no shortage of issues – such as poverty eradication, aid effectiveness, and international development – to be discussed at the upcoming IMF/World Bank meeting.
But the failure of IMF leaders to produce a forward-looking strategy to confront impending market turmoil would undermine progress in all of these areas.
The last thing that a still-fragile global economy needs is more uncertainty.
Giving the Well-Performing State Its Due
MADRID – The triumph of democracy and market-based economics – the “End of History,” as the American political philosopher Francis Fukuyama famously called it – which was proclaimed to be inevitable with the fall of the Berlin Wall, soon proved to be little more than a mirage.
However, following China’s intellectual pirouette to maintain one-party rule while embracing the capitalist credo, history’s interpreters shifted their focus to the economy: not everybody would be free and elect their government, but capitalist prosperity would hold sway worldwide.
Now, however, the economic tumult shaking Europe, the erosion of the middle class in the West, and the growing social inequalities worldwide are undermining capitalism’s claim to universal triumph.
Hard questions are being asked: Is capitalism as we know it doomed?
Is the market no longer able to generate prosperity?
Is China’s brand of state capitalism an alternative and potentially victorious paradigm?
The pervasive soul-searching prompted by such questions has nurtured a growing recognition that capitalism’s success depends not only on macroeconomic policy or economic indicators.
It rests on a bedrock of good governance and the rule of law – in other words, a well-performing state.
The West overlooked the fundamental importance of this while it was fighting communism.
The standard bearers of the Cold War were not just the United States and the Soviet Union, but, in ideological terms, the individual and the collectivity.
When competing in newly independent or developing countries, this ideological opposition became Manichean, fostering a fierce suspicion, if not outright rejection, of rival principles.
As a result, strengthening state institutions was too often seen in the West as communist subterfuge, while the Soviet bloc viewed the slightest notion of individual freedom and responsibility as a stalking horse for capitalist counter-revolution.
Leading economists have long argued that the West’s greater reliance on markets resulted in faster and more robust economic growth.
But viewing the state and the market in terms of their inherent conflict no longer reflects reality (if it ever did).
Indeed, it is increasingly obvious that the threat to capitalism today emanates not from the state’s presence, but rather from its absence or inadequate performance.
Consider recent events in Argentina, which is facing certain economic losses as anxious investors have second thoughts about the country in the aftermath of the government’s nationalization of energy giant YPF.
That response is only logical, as investors seek the security of a well-functioning legal system to protect them from capricious political decisions.
Mexico provides further proof that the market alone is not enough.
An efficient judiciary and effective policing are necessary for capitalism to thrive.
In Brazil, the government is daring, for the first time, to address the lawlessness of the overcrowded favelas that ring the country’s large cities.
Or consider Ghana’s prosperity and how, like Brazil’s, it is going hand in hand with improved governance.
At the opposite extreme, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s undermining of his country’s institutions, prodding it onto a narco-state trajectory, places Venezuela alongside Haiti as an exception to Latin America’s recent economic success.
More generally, the world’s thriving countries are those with strong and effective institutions, backed by legal frameworks that guarantee the rule of law.
Latin America and Africa are not the only examples that prove the point.
The European Union’s internal problems, and its ongoing sovereign-debt crisis, are clearly linked to the weakness of its institutions, and, on Europe’s periphery, it still confronts feckless democracies.
Indeed, on Europe’s doorstep, the show trial and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is jeopardizing her country’s international economic standing.
In particular, President Viktor Yanukovych’s contempt for the rule of law has put Ukraine’s relations with the European Union in cold storage, with a comprehensive free-trade and association agreement on hold pending the release of Tymoshenko and other political prisoners.
Meanwhile, political trials in Egypt are attracting international attention and deterring foreign investment.
In Asia, China is exposing the fallacy of looking at state capitalism as a competing alternative to liberal capitalism.
Approaching them as alternatives is, in fact, little more than an intellectual remnant of the Cold War, much like the concept of “state capitalism” itself.
With its remarkable ability to adapt, China is making strides to accommodate the rising power of its markets and people.
In the process, officials are acknowledging the importance of good governance, as demonstrated by recent efforts to justify the purge and investigation of Bo Xilai as an example of the Communist Party “safeguarding the rule of law.”
Adam Smith, that icon of market theory, argued that wealth is created when public institutions enable the “invisible hand” of the market to align interests.
The Cold War distorted that wisdom.
In a world free of that era’s ideological constraints, it is time to say loud and clear that the future of capitalism is linked to effective governance and the rule of law, and thus to the consolidation of well-functioning states.
Giving Till it Heals
In my new book The End of Poverty , I show how extreme poverty can be ended by 2025, but only if the rich world follows through on its promise to help the poorest countries.
In order to thrive, and to foster the private-sector investment needed for long-term growth, an economy requires functioning health and education systems, investments in soil nutrients and water management, and basic infrastructure such as electricity and motorized transport.
Yet the poorest countries, even well governed ones, lack the resources to finance these investments.
Lack of adequate foreign assistance is one of the greatest disgraces on our planet, and the United States has been the biggest laggard of all.
It is urgent that the US wake up to global realities, and that it follow through on its commitments.
The most famous single promise by the rich countries has been to provide aid to the poorest countries equal to at least 0.7% of their GNP.
The commitment began 44 years ago, in 1961, when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the objective that foreign assistance should increase significantly, “so as to reach as soon as possible approximately 1% of the combined national incomes of the economically advanced countries.”
At the time, foreign assistance was about 0.5% of rich-country income.
Despite the promises, aid continued to decline.
By the early 1990’s, official development assistance was still around 0.33% of donor GNP, and by the early 2000’s, it had declined to around 0.22% of GNP.
Now it is roughly 0.25% of GNP.
But the long-term decline in the ratio of aid to GNP did not stop the rich world from promising time and again to reach 0.7% of GNP, including at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development in 1995.
At the start of the new millennium, the world’s leaders got together to adopt the Millennium Development Goals, the global commitment to halve extreme poverty by 2015.
To implement these commitments, world leaders, including US President George W. Bush, met again in Monterrey, Mexico, to adopt the Monterrey Consensus on how to achieve the breakthrough from poverty.
The personal presence of Bush is notable, because the rich countries once again adopted the target of 0.7% of GNP, with the US being a signatory.
The US government often declares these days that it is not bound by any “arbitrary” numerical target such as 0.7% of GNP.
Top officials even declare that the US never signed on to such a goal.
Yet the US and other countries did sign the Monterrey Consensus urging “developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of Gross National Product as official development assistance.”
It could hardly be more clear.
Alas, the US has shown absolutely no “concrete efforts” towards keeping this commitment.
In fact, US official development assistance amounts to just 0.15% of America’s GNP, which is less than one-fourth the global target.
This contrasts with the 4% of GNP that the US spends on its military, roughly $500 billion this year.
So the US spends around thirty times more on the military than it does on peaceful development aid for the poorest countries.
From a global point of view, there are currently five countries that have reached 0.7% of GNP in aid: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.
Six more countries, all in Europe, have recently set a timetable to reach 0.7% of GNP by the year 2015.
They are Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report in advance of the UN summit of world leaders in September 2005, has called on all donor countries to reach at least 0.5% of GNP in aid by 2009, and 0.7% by 2015.
He also noted that countries like Germany and Japan that aspire to permanent UN Security Council membership have a particular responsibility of global stewardship in reaching the target.
Sadly, the ideological mouthpieces for the super-rich in the US, especially the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal , remain bitterly opposed to foreign aid, even if it’s just 70 cents per hundred dollars of income!
In criticizing my book, a Wall Street Journal review said that I was calling for “Giving Till it Hurts.”
But there is a limit to greed.
I am quite sure that The Wall Street Journal does not really represent the interests or views of many or even most of American rich people, including the millionaires and billionaires whose contributions to aid could make a huge difference for the lives of millions of people.
Many remarkable philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, are already leading the way.
I believe that few wealthy people would refuse to contribute a small portion of their huge wealth for the chance to save the lives of millions of people each year and help the poorest countries get the first foot on the ladder of economic development.
They will know that they would not only save lives, but also contribute to a much safer and more prosperous world.
Instead of worrying that 70 cents per $100 is giving till it hurts, our slogan in the rich countries should be “Giving Till it Heals.”
Global Action for Global Recovery
WASHINGTON, DC – The global economy has entered a dangerous new phase.
There is a path to sustained recovery, but it is narrowing.
To navigate it, we need strong political will around the world – leadership over brinksmanship, cooperation over competition, and action over reaction.
One of the main problems today is too much debt in the global financial system – among sovereigns, banks, and households, and especially among the advanced economies.
This is denting confidence and holding back spending, investment, and job creation.
These countries face a weak and bumpy recovery, with unacceptably high unemployment.
The eurozone debt crisis has worsened, and financial strains are rising.
Political indecision in some quarters is making matters worse.
Social tensions bubbling beneath the surface could well add fuel to the crisis of confidence.
In these circumstances, we need collective action for global recovery along four main policy lines: repair, reform, rebalancing, and rebuilding.
First, repair.
Before doing anything else, we must relieve some of the balance-sheet pressures – on sovereigns, households, and banks – that risk smothering the recovery.
Advanced countries need credible medium-term plans to stabilize and reduce public debt.
But consolidating too quickly can hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects.
There is a solution.
Credible measures that deliver and anchor savings in the medium term will help create space to accommodate growth today – by allowing a slower pace of consolidation.
Of course, the precise path is different for each country, as some are under market pressure and have no choice, while others have more space.
It is also important to relieve pressure on household and banks.
With respect to the United States, I welcome President Barack Obama’s recent proposals to address growth and employment; actions like more aggressive principal-reduction programs or helping homeowners to take advantage of low-interest rates would also help.
And, in Europe, the sovereigns must address firmly their financing problems through credible fiscal consolidation.
In addition, to support growth, banks must have sufficient capital buffers.
The second issue is reform, with the financial sector a high priority.
On the positive side, we have broad agreement on higher-quality capital and liquidity standards with appropriate phase-in arrangements.
But substantial gaps remain and must be addressed through international cooperation in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage.
I would also include the social dimension under the reform banner – particularly the need to identify and nurture sources of growth capable of generating sufficient jobs.
This is especially important for the young.
The third target of collective action, rebalancing, has two meanings.
First, it means shifting demand back to the private sector when it is strong enough to carry the load.
That hasn’t happened yet.
Rebalancing also involves a global demand switch from external-deficit countries to those running large current-account surpluses.
With lower spending and higher savings in the advanced economies, key emerging markets must take up the slack and start providing the demand needed to power the global recovery.
But this rebalancing, too, has not happened sufficiently, and if the advanced economies succumb to recession, nobody will escape.
The fourth policy imperative is rebuilding.
Many countries, including those with low income levels, need to rebuild their economic defenses – for example, by strengthening their budget positions – to protect themselves against future storms.
This will also help to provide the space for growth-enhancing public investment and important social safety nets.
In these circumstances, the International Monetary Fund – with its 187 member countries – is uniquely positioned to foster collective action.
Our policy advice can help shine a light on the pressing issues of the day – growth, core vulnerabilities, and interconnectedness.
Our lending can provide breathing space for countries in difficulty.
And, looking beyond the crisis horizon, the IMF can also help construct a safer and more stable international financial system.
This is no time for half-measures or muddling through.
If we seize the moment, we can navigate our way out of this crisis and restore strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.
But we need to act quickly – and together.
Do We Want Powerful Leaders?
CAMBRIDGE – A trend toward greater authoritarianism seems to be spreading worldwide.
Vladimir Putin has successfully used nationalism to tighten his control over Russia and seems to enjoy great popularity.
Xi Jinping is regarded as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, presiding over a growing number of crucial decision-making committees.
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, recently replaced his prime minister with one more compliant with his drive to concentrate executive power.
And some commentators fear that if Donald Trump wins the US presidency in November, he could turn out to be an “American Mussolini.”
Abuse of power is as old as human history.
The Bible reminds us that after David defeated Goliath and later became king, he seduced Bathsheba and deliberately sent her husband to certain death in battle.
Leadership involves the use of power, and, as Lord Acton famously warned, power corrupts.
And yet leaders without power – the ability to cause others to do what we want – cannot lead.
The Harvard psychologist David C. McClelland once distinguished three groups of people by their motivations.
Those who care most about doing something better have a “need for achievement.”
Those who think most about friendly relations with others have a “need for affiliation.”
And those who care most about having an impact on others show a “need for power.”
This third group turned out to be the most effective leaders, which brings us back to Acton.
But power is not good or bad per se.
Like calories in a diet, too little produces emaciation, and too much leads to obesity.
Emotional maturity and training are important means of limiting a narcissistic lust for power, and appropriate institutions are essential to getting the balance right.
Ethics and power can be mutually reinforcing.
But ethics can also be used instrumentally to increase power.
Machiavelli addressed the importance of ethics for leaders, but primarily in terms of the impression that visible displays of virtue made upon followers.
The appearance of virtue is an important source of a leader’s soft power or the ability to get what one wants by attraction rather than coercion or payment.
Indeed, for Machiavelli, a prince’s virtues should only be apparent, never real.
“I will even venture to affirm that if he has and invariably practices them all, they are hurtful, while the appearance of having them is useful.”
Machiavelli also stressed the importance of the hard power of coercion and payment when a leader faces a tradeoff with the soft power of attraction, “since being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself.”
Machiavelli believed that when one must choose, it is better to be feared than to be loved.
But he also understood that fear and love are not opposites, and that the opposite of love – hatred – is particularly dangerous for leaders.
The anarchic world of Italian Renaissance city-states was more violent and dangerous than that of today’s democracies, but elements of Machiavelli’s advice remain relevant to modern leaders.
In addition to the courage of the lion, Machiavelli also extolled the strategic deceptiveness of the fox.
Idealism without realism rarely reshapes the world, but as we judge our modern democratic leaders, we should keep both Machiavelli and Acton in mind.
We should look for and support leaders who possess an ethical element of self-restraint and a need for achievement and affiliation as well as for power.
But there is another aspect of Acton’s dilemma besides the ethics of leaders: the demands of followers.
Leadership is a combination of leaders’ traits, followers’ demands, and the context in which they interact.
A Russian public anxious about its status; a Chinese people concerned about rampant corruption; a Turkish population divided over ethnicity and religion: All create enabling environments for leaders who feel a psychological need for power.
Similarly, to satisfy his narcissistic need for power, Trump magnifies the discontent of a part of the population through clever manipulation of television news programs and social media.
This is where institutions play a crucial role.
In the early United States, James Madison and the new country’s other founders saw that neither leaders nor followers would be angels, and that institutions must be designed to reinforce restraints.
They concluded from their study of the ancient Roman Republic that what was needed to prevent the rise of an overweening leader like Julius Caesar was an institutional framework of separation of powers, whereby faction would balance faction.
Madison’s answer to the possibility of an “American Mussolini” was a system of institutional checks and balances ensuring that the US would never resemble Italy in 1922 – or Russia, China, or Turkey today.
The American founders wrestled with the dilemma of how powerful we want our leaders to be.
Their answer was designed to preserve liberty, not maximize government efficiency.
Many commentators have complained about institutional decay, while others point to changes – such as the advent of reality television and social media – that have coarsened the quality of public discourse.
Later this year, we may find out how resilient the American founders’ framework for power and leadership really is.
The Threat To Global Banking Standards
LONDON – The financial crisis of 2008 gave a big boost to the global standard-setters.
Suddenly, the Basel Committee (which sets the standards for international banking supervision) was leading the financial news.
Dinner parties in Manhattan and Kensington were consumed with the finer points of Basel II and the evils of procyclical capital requirements.
Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher global rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others, like bouts of Asian flu.
The concrete consequences of this enthusiasm were the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), born out of the ashes of the Financial Stability Forum, at the G20’s London summit in April 2009, and inclusion of representatives of all G20 members among the key rule makers in Basel and elsewhere.
The G7’s domination gave way to the hope that broader membership would produce more comprehensive buy-in and stronger political support for increasing the banking system’s capital.
All this change has worked, up to a point.
The Basel III regulations, for example, more than doubled the capital an individual bank should hold, and enhanced the quality of that capital.
The system looks somewhat safer as a result.
But now there are dangerous signs that the commitment to stronger global standards – indeed, to any common standards – may be on the wane.
Many predicted this trend, but for the wrong reason.
Skeptics warned that it would be far harder to reach agreement among 20 or more countries than it had been among the dozen pre-crisis Basel Committee members (mainly European countries, with only the US, Canada, and Japan representing the world beyond).
In practice, that has not turned out to be a major problem.
Basel III was agreed far more quickly than Basel II was.
Political pressure from finance ministers, expressed through the FSB, proved effective.
In fact, recent tensions have been more old-fashioned, pitting the US against the eurozone, with the UK and others stuck in between.
The US has been pressing for tighter controls on banks’ internal models, and for a limit on how much a bank’s models can reduce its assets on a risk-weighted basis.
Agreement on these so-called output floors has so far proved impossible.
The Europeans argue that their banks’ corporate lending is inherently less risky. After all, EU banks lend more to higher-rated large companies, which access US capital markets, rather than borrowing from banks.
They also hold more low-risk mortgages on their balance sheets, in the absence of a European equivalent of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (America’s two quasi-public mortgage banks), which hoovered up securitized US mortgages.
At its meeting in Santiago, Chile, in November, the Basel Committee conspicuously failed to agree on a solution, and kicked the issue upstairs to the committee of Governors and Heads of Supervision, which will try again in January.
They will probably find a way to thread this particular needle.
But the future for global standards looks more uncertain than it has for some time.
Since the 2008 crisis, many countries, while ostensibly supporting the development of tighter global rules, have been taking other measures to protect their own financial systems.
The collapse of Lehman Brothers and others showed, in former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King’s memorable phrase, that big banks are “global in life, but national in death.”
In other words, when a global bank crashes, the host-country regulators must pick up the local pieces.
That’s why requirements to establish local subsidiaries, with local capital, have been adopted.
Gone are the days when banks could set up branches all over the planet, with support from the parent’s balance sheet.
Subsidiarization is now the rule.
And, looking ahead, we can see that the two biggest players in the FSB and Basel have other preoccupations.
Donald Trump’s incoming US administration has already signaled its suspicion of foreign entanglements and international commitments.
Making America great again is not likely to involve new enthusiasm for more intrusive rules made in Basel.
Those who advocate rolling back much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, in favor of a higher leverage ratio, as promoted in a bill advanced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, envisage a “Made in the USA” version of banking regulation.
But, while the idea has some merit, it would not sit easily within the current Basel framework.
Europe faces other worries.
Regulators there are now keenly focused on the implications of Brexit, which will require complex arrangements to manage a new relationship between London and the eurozone.
The top priority for the European Central Bank must be to preserve the integrity of the EU banking union, which is under pressure from both Brexit and the crisis gripping Italy’s banks.
Against this background, it will be a challenge to retain the primacy of global standards and to secure continued buy-in to the Basel process.
The Bank for International Settlements’ new general manager, Agustín Carstens, a former governor of Mexico’s central bank, will have a key role to play, as will whoever replaces Mark Carney (the current Governor of the Bank of England) next year as Chairman of the FSB.
It is likely, too, that there will soon be a new Chair of the Basel Committee itself.
Stefan Ingves of Sweden is due to step down next June.
These three new leaders will need all of their diplomatic skills to navigate treacherous political waters.
The stakes are high.
If the commitment to global standards wanes, everyone will suffer in the long run.
Countries will impose incompatible local requirements, which will reduce the efficiency of capital utilization and make the system less robust in the event of renewed financial instability.
Putting Public Health on the Map
SEATTLE – Twenty-five years ago, the state of public health for large populations was like that of a doctor trying to treat a patient without a proper diagnosis.
The diseases and injuries that cut lives short and caused widespread suffering were not rigorously tracked.
Back then, well-meaning advocates for different diseases published death tolls that helped them make the case for funding and attention.
But when all the claims were added up, the total was many times greater than the number of people who actually died in a given year.
And even when policymakers had accurate data, it usually included only causes of death, not the illnesses that afflicted the living.
To address this problem, Alan Lopez and I launched the Global Burden of Disease project (GBD) in 1990.
Decision-makers need information about the world’s biggest health threats and how they have changed over time, across age groups, and by sex, so they can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live the longest, healthiest life possible.
By ensuring that each death is counted just once, and by providing comprehensive statistics on the causes of ill health, the GBD can compare the impact of cancer to that of lower back pain or depression.
It also enables comparison of health-care performance among countries.
GBD’s 1990 study and subsequent revisions raised the bar for population health measurement, providing decision-makers with more reliable and useful information.
It also opened the international development community’s eyes to the importance of overlooked afflictions, such as mental illness and road injuries.
Donors such as the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation use GBD data to guide their investments, and more than 30 countries have conducted their own burden-of-disease studies.
Countries such as Australia, Botswana, China, Mexico, Norway, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom are using GBD findings to inform health policies.
In China, the results of the GBD project, launched at a policy summit in 2013, raised awareness about the deadly impact of air pollution on the country’s population.
Those findings helped shape the Chinese government’s efforts to curb the negative effects of pollution on health, and Chinese researchers are now key members of the global collaborative effort.
In Rwanda, when the GBD study revealed that indoor air pollution from cooking with solid fuel was a leading cause of death, the government launched a program to distribute one million clean stoves to the most vulnerable households.
Rwandan scientists and officials from the Ministry of Health – including the minister herself – are important contributors to the GBD.
Today, the GBD is constantly improving, thanks to the efforts of more than 1,300 collaborators in 114 countries.
These collaborators improve the models on which the project is built, vet the study results, contribute new data sets, and communicate the results to media outlets, educational institutions, and decision-makers.
The latest GBD study revealed that another disease seldom discussed in international development circles, lower back and neck pain, is the fourth largest cause of health loss globally.
It also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and the persistence of communicable, maternal, newborn, and nutritional disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa.
But the GBD could do more to inform policy debates and spur action to improve health if it were able to provide more detailed breakdowns of data.
Policymakers are accountable, first and foremost, to their constituents, whose unique needs they must meet.
Estimates of local disease burdens will be essential for combating afflictions like Ebola, checking the rising toll of non-communicable diseases in middle-income countries, and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals relating to maternal and child health in Sub-Saharan Africa.
To help decision-makers make better use of their data, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which I head, is creating geospatial maps of disease burdens with a groundbreaking level of resolution.
Creating these maps is possible thanks to methods developed by the Malaria Atlas Project, which has produced a better spatial understanding of malaria than we have for any pathogen.
Geospatial maps can pinpoint areas that are making outstanding progress, allowing us to identify communities that have done things differently from their neighbors.
These case studies can empower communities to replicate one another’s successes.
One example is Cali, Colombia, which drove down homicide rates in the 1990s after the city’s mayor, Rodrigo Guerrero, tightened alcohol restrictions, introduced community-development programs in the most impoverished neighborhoods, and imposed temporary gun bans in public places.
The mayor of Colombia’s capital, Bogota, learned about the program in Cali and implemented similar measures, which have helped reduce homicides steadily in the city.
Since then, Guerrero has worked with the Inter-American Development Bank to develop programs that help other Latin American countries reduce violence in their communities.
In 2014, Guerrero won the Roux Prize for his use of data to improve health, further elevating awareness of his work.
Geospatial mapping will help us identify more Rodrigo Guerreros and champion their achievements.
As the international community comes together to agree on the tools needed to finance and monitor progress toward the MDGs’ successor framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, geospatial mapping will be critical for tracking progress and indicating where course corrections might be needed.
We are far beyond where we were in 1990 in terms of health measurement.
With focused effort and further innovation, we can make even more progress in the next 25 years to help the world make the most of our collective health investments.
Making Climate Promises Count
OTTAWA – This year will be one of the warmest on record.
Over the last decade, greenhouse-gas emissions have accelerated, and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased in the past year at the fastest rate in nearly three decades, reaching a level that is 15% higher than in 1990.
As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes, the disconnect between an intensifying climate crisis and stalled international negotiations has never been greater.
Needless to say, a lot is riding on next year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference&nbsp;in Paris, which could shape strategies to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions until 2050.
But the summit is unlikely to deliver the global agreement that is so badly needed, unless world leaders broaden their focus to include not only emissions reduction, but also carbon pricing.
A growing number of experts – including those at the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, and the World Bank – agree that no climate plan can be successful without an effective and efficient carbon-pricing system.
The IPCC has concluded that if a single global carbon price is not established soon, it will be virtually impossible to prevent global warming from surpassing 2ºC above preindustrial levels – the threshold beyond which the most devastating effects of climate change would become unavoidable.
The one-dimensional approach based exclusively on emissions-reduction targets is preventing even the regions that have been most active on climate change, such as the European Union, from making sufficient progress.
Yet, in late October, EU member states agreed on a new policy framework for climate and energy for 2030 – one that, like the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package, lacks a solid foundation.
The EU’s established goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 40% by 2030 is supported only by non-binding energy-efficiency and renewable-energy targets.
Devoid of true carbon-pricing reform, the deal depends on the EU’s derelict Emissions Trading System.
The result is a set of impressive-sounding commitments without instruments for effective implementation.
The same can be said of the widely touted new bilateral agreement between the United States and China, the world’s two largest carbon emitters.
Given the deadlock that previously prevailed, the deal represents welcome progress; but it, too, lacks adequate instruments to support its ambitions.
The Paris summit next year needs to produce a more substantial agreement, with national emissions-reduction targets underpinned by adequate and coordinated tools for implementation, including a trial global carbon price.
On an issue as urgent as climate change, there simply is no room for ambiguity.
The first step toward creating such an agreement is to initiate a debate, supported by academic research and scientific evidence, aimed at determining a desirable global carbon price and outlining the linkages between current and future prices, taking into account equity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
Such a debate – not emissions-reduction targets guaranteed only by states’ “political will” – will be the mark of a successful summit.
In fact, no outcome would be worse than a “feel-good” agreement composed of vague, unenforceable targets.
The US government’s recent statements in favor of a “political” agreement rather than a “legally binding” accord is yet another indication that official declarations alone will produce precisely such a result.
In the longer term, a constructive debate in Paris on an appropriate global carbon price could pave the way for the development of a new, polycentric approach to climate governance that would value territorial and local initiatives, in addition to national efforts.
At that point, discrete carbon prices could gradually converge toward a single price, as has occurred with prices for commodities like oil.
EU leaders often boast to their global partners of their commitment to mitigating climate change.
And they may be right.
But, so far, the EU has stood out more because the rest of the world is lagging than because it has designed a truly effective strategy to address the problem; its recently concluded agreement could actually serve as a counter-model for next year’s summit.
The price of carbon effectively amounts to the price of human wellbeing on this planet.
If Europe truly wants to lead the fight against climate change, it should bring the issue of a harmonized carbon-pricing system to the negotiating table in Paris.
In doing so, it would launch a critical shift toward a comprehensive and, for the first time, effective climate agreement.
The Crisis of Our Crises
PRINCETON – At first glance, today’s major international crises seem to have little in common.
Some, such as Greece’s debt drama, are economic disasters; others, like Syria’s implosion, are characterized by brutality and political chaos; and still others, most notably Ukraine’s predicament, fall somewhere in between.
But, despite what policymakers might like to believe, these events are not unrelated.
On the contrary, they reflect a deeper crisis of international integration and cooperation.
Over the last 60 years, the world experienced unprecedented peace and prosperity for a simple reason: countries voluntarily integrated themselves into an international community underpinned by shared rules and norms.
But this trend has given way to piecemeal crisis responses, whether austerity or localized damage control, that are based on the unreasonable assumption that problems like those in Greece, Syria, and Ukraine will eventually correct themselves.
In relying on stopgap measures to address crises, global leaders seem to have forgotten how interdependent the world has become.
Upheaval or stagnation in one part of a complex system can have outsize consequences elsewhere, in the form of, say, a refugee crisis or an uptick in inequality.
For example, Europe’s malaise – which has persisted partly because its leaders have insisted on muddling through, rather than seeking comprehensive solutions – has had serious consequences for Ukraine, a country teetering on the edge of a meltdown.
By the end of this year, Ukraine’s economy is expected to be 15% smaller than it was 2013, and its debt-to-GDP ratio may be near 200%, exceeding Greece’s at its worst.
And the security situation in the eastern part of the country is deteriorating.
Creditors cannot be expected to be any more lenient with Ukraine than they have been with Greece, a member of the eurozone.
But a hard stance on Ukraine while it fights a war with Russia could threaten Europe’s strategic buffer from the Baltic to the Balkans.
The economist Albert O. Hirschman once said that a crisis can be either disintegrative or integrative.
Individuals and organizations, confronted with adversity and lacking faith in policymakers, can either “exit” from the institutions and societies that bind them, or rally together to revitalize them.
Unfortunately, today’s crises so far have seemed largely disintegrative.
Consider capital flight, which forced Greece to impose controls.
Of course, exit mechanisms like capital flight can have a positive impact.
In the eighteenth century, capital flight kept predatory rulers in check.
Adam Smith viewed the rise of movable capital as a force that would encourage enlightened public policies that serve the general interest.
But, in today’s interconnected world, capital can move much more quickly and to many more destinations, crossing borders with the click of a mouse.
Moreover, the global financial industry is largely autonomous, driven by self-interest, rather than a desire to advance the common good.
As we have seen in Europe since 2010, as well as in Ukraine and Puerto Rico more recently, the ability to rush for the exit at any time removes investors’ incentive to compromise.
As policymakers struggle to create a consensus around a reform agenda, the prospects of rejuvenating the pacts and policies underlying integration and cooperation deteriorate.
But the world order is by no means fated to devolve into chaos.
Today’s crisis of international integration can become the catalyst for the creation of a new or revitalized global system.
This has happened before.
Indeed, the current world order arose from the major crises of the Great Depression and World War II, with countries building the social pacts and economic institutions that would underpin peace and prosperity for the next several decades.
To ensure that a crisis produces such a constructive integrative response, policymakers must change their mindset.
Instead of seeing only problems that need to be contained, they should view crises as an opportunity for progress.
Today, some important integrative policies lie within reach.
On the economic front, policymakers should stop pouring public money into bailouts that benefit private creditors at the expense of taxpayers, and they should end austerity programs that kill growth prospects and do not address debt overhang.
They must also reform tax systems and improve cooperation to reduce tax evasion, using the added revenues to invest in physical infrastructure and education.
Such measures will create jobs today, and secure prosperity for tomorrow.
Political measures are also needed.
Europe needs a more democratic framework that keeps financiers at the negotiating table.
Similarly, with the possibility of admitting Ukraine to NATO a dead letter, the West should take steps to ease tensions with Russia, in order to ensure its continued participation in international efforts to address key threats (as it did when negotiating the recent agreement to rein in Iran’s nuclear program).
Muddling through can lead to only one outcome: disintegration.
Only when world leaders recognize the common source and the interconnectedness of current international crises will they be in a position to address them effectively.
Is It Time for Global Money?
NEW YORK – Today’s world is more economically and financially integrated than at any time since the latter half of the nineteenth century.
But policymaking – particularly central banking – remains anachronistically national and parochial.
Isn’t it time to re-think the global monetary (non)system?
In particular, wouldn’t a single global central bank and a world currency make more sense than our confusing, inefficient, and outdated assemblage of national monetary policies and currencies?
Technology is now reaching the point where a common digital currency, enabled by near-universal mobile phone adoption, certainly makes this possible.
And however farfetched a global currency may sound, recall that before World War I, ditching the gold standard seemed equally implausible.
The current system is both risky and inefficient.
Different monies are not only a nuisance for tourists who arrive home with pockets full of unspendable foreign coins.
Global firms waste time and resources on largely futile efforts to hedge currency risk (benefiting only the banks that act as middlemen).
The benefits of ridding the world of national currencies would be enormous.
In one fell swoop, the risk of currency wars, and the harm they can inflict on the world economy, would be eliminated.
Pricing would be more transparent, and consumers could spot anomalies (from their phones) and shop for the best deals.
And, by eliminating foreign-exchange transactions and hedging costs, a single currency would reinvigorate stalled world trade and improve the efficiency of global capital allocation.
In short, the current state of affairs is the by-product of the superseded era of the nation-state.
Globalization has shrunk the dimensions of the world economy, and the time for a world central bank has arrived.
Dream on.
A single world currency is in fact neither likely nor desirable.
Central banks, while ideally independent from political influence, are nonetheless accountable to the body politic.
They owe their legitimacy to the political process that created them, rooted in the will of the citizenry they were established to serve (and from which they derive their authority).
The history of central banking, though comparatively brief, suggests that democratically derived legitimacy is possible only at the level of the nation-state.
At the supra-national level, legitimacy remains highly questionable, as the experience of the eurozone amply demonstrates.
Only if the European Union’s sovereignty eclipses, by democratic choice, that of the nation-states that comprise it will the European Central Bank have the legitimacy it requires to remain the eurozone’s sole monetary authority.
But the same political legitimacy cannot be imagined for any transatlantic or trans-Pacific monetary authority, much less a global one.
Treaties between countries can harmonize rules governing commerce and other areas.
But they cannot transfer sovereignty over an institution as powerful as a central bank or a symbol as compelling as paper money.
Central banks’ legitimacy matters most when the stakes are highest.
Everyday monetary-policy decisions are, to put it mildly, unlikely to excite the passions of the masses.
The same cannot be said of the less frequent need (one hopes) for the monetary authority to act as lender of last resort to commercial banks and even to the government.
As we have witnessed in recent years, such interventions can be the difference between financial chaos and collapse and mere retrenchment and recession.
And only central banks, with their ability to create freely their own liabilities, can play this role.
Yet the tough decisions that central banks must make in such circumstances – preventing destabilizing runs versus encouraging moral hazard – are simultaneously technocratic and political.
Above all, the legitimacy of their decisions is rooted in law, which itself is the expression of democratic will.
Bail out one bank and not another?
Purchase sovereign debt but not state or commonwealth (for example, Puerto Rican) debt?
Though deciding such questions at a supranational level is not theoretically impossible, it is utterly impractical in the modern era.
Legitimacy, not technology, is the currency of central banks.
But the fact that a single global central bank and currency would fail spectacularly (regardless of how strong the economic case for it may be) does not absolve policymakers of their responsibility to address the challenges posed by a fragmented global monetary system.
And that means bolstering global multilateral institutions.
The International Monetary Fund’s role as independent arbiter of sound macroeconomic policy and guardian against competitive currency devaluation ought to be strengthened.
Finance ministers and central bankers in large economies should underscore, in a common protocol, their commitment to market-determined exchange rates.
And, as Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, recently suggested, the IMF should backstop emerging economies that might face liquidity crises as a result of the normalization of US monetary policy.
Likewise, a more globalized world requires a commitment from all actors to improve infrastructure, in order to ensure the efficient flow of resources throughout the world economy.
To this end, the World Bank’s capital base in its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development should be increased along the lines of the requested $253 billion, to help fund emerging economies’ investments in highways, airports, and much else.
Multilateral support for infrastructure investment is not the only way global trade can be revived under the current monetary arrangements.
As was amply demonstrated in the last seven decades, reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers would also help – above all in agriculture and services, as envisaged by the Doha Round.
Global financial stability, too, can be strengthened within the existing framework.
All that is required is harmonized, transparent, and easy-to-understand regulation and supervision.
For today’s international monetary system, the perfect – an unattainable single central bank and currency – should not be made the enemy of the good.
Working within our existing means, it is surely possible to improve our policy tools and boost global growth and prosperity.
The Debt Dilemma
LONDON/WASHINGTON, DC – Greece’s divisive negotiations with the EU have placed debt back at the center of debates about economic growth and stability.
But Greece is not the only country struggling to repay its existing debt, much less dampen borrowing.
Its fraught negotiations with its creditors should spur other countries to take action to address their own debt overhangs.
Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, the world’s debt has risen by $57 trillion, exceeding GDP growth.
Government debt has increased by $25 trillion, with the advanced economies accounting for $19 trillion – a direct result of severe recession, fiscal-stimulus programs, and bank bailouts.
While American households have reduced their debt considerably (mainly through mortgage defaults), household debt in many other countries has continued to grow rapidly.
In all major economies, the debt-to-GDP ratio (including both public and private debt) is higher today than it was in 2007.
Much of this debt accumulation was driven by efforts to support economic growth in the face of deflationary headwinds after the 2008 crisis.
That was especially so in China, which, together with other developing economies, accounts for nearly half of the debt incurred since 2008.
To be sure, debt itself is not bad.
But excessive reliance on debt creates the risk of financial crises, which undermine growth.
Given this, the world needs to find both less credit-intensive routes to growth and ways to eliminate existing debt burdens.
To help limit future debt accumulation, countries have three options.
First, they can employ countercyclical macroprudential measures to dampen credit cycles and prevent excessive borrowing.
For example, stricter loan-to-value-ratio limits and higher capital requirements for banks could slow credit growth when housing or commercial real-estate markets are overheating.
Yet precisely the opposite approach is now being taken in the United States, where some first-time homebuyers have now been given access to 97% loan-to-value mortgages.
A second strategy for curbing the buildup of debt could be to introduce mortgage contracts that enable more risk sharing between borrowers and lenders, essentially acting as debt/equity hybrids.
As the Great Recession grimly illustrated, when a period of soaring real-estate valuations and rising household debt is followed by a period of falling prices, and households attempt to deleverage, the results can be catastrophic.
The talent for financial innovation that produced harmful new home-mortgage options before the crash should now be harnessed to develop more flexible mortgages that help borrowers avoid default.
One example is “shared responsibility” mortgages, in which payments are reduced under certain circumstances, such as when home prices dip below the borrower’s purchase price.
In exchange for this flexibility, the lender receives a share of any capital gain that is realized when the home is sold.
Similarly, the continuous-workout mortgage adjusts payments and terms in specific cases, such as job loss.
A third option for limiting debt accumulation is to reconsider tax rules that favor debt.
In many countries, interest accrued on a mortgage remains tax deductible.
Though phasing out this policy is politically contentious, some countries – such as the United Kingdom in the 1980s – have managed to do so.
Similarly, it would be difficult – but not impossible – to reduce the incentives, created by almost all countries’ tax regimes, for corporate leverage.
Governments must also work to reduce existing debt – and the deficient global demand to which it contributes.
It is simply not feasible for the most highly leveraged governments to grow their way out of debt.
Nor can austerity alone suffice, as it would require countries to make such large fiscal adjustments – 5% of GDP, in Spain’s case – that citizens would likely resist them, as the Greeks have done.
A more effective approach would employ a broader range of tools, including debt restructuring.
In some countries, sales of public assets and the levying of one-off wealth taxes would also be helpful.
Investors, analysts, and other commentators, for their part, must take a more nuanced view of governments’ true debt liabilities.
Much of the sovereign-debt accumulation of recent years has been enabled by quantitative easing, with central banks making large-scale purchases of government bonds.
The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan now own 16%, 24%, and 22%, respectively, of all bonds outstanding.
Given that central banks are owned by the government, and that interest paid on outstanding bonds is remitted back to the national treasury, these government bonds are fundamentally different from those owned by other creditors.
Focusing on “net” government debt (which excludes intra-government debt holdings, such as the bonds owned by central banks) is a more effective approach to assessing and ensuring the sustainability of public debt.
The global economic crisis laid bare the challenge of debt reduction – and the risks that excessive indebtedness raises.
Yet the crisis also intensified government and household dependence on leverage, causing debt levels to continue to rise – a trend that, left unchecked, will lead to more crises in the future.
It is time to redirect financial innovation toward developing new tools and approaches to address these challenges.
Only then can the world economy move onto a sustainable growth path.
Global Disaster Recovery
PALO ALTO – With the global economy mired in recession and financial crisis, policymakers everywhere have launched a series of monetary, financial, and fiscal responses.
Nevertheless, economies continue to contract, unemployment to rise, and wealth to decline.
Countries’ policy responses have ranged from modest to immense.
China has undertaken a 6%-of-GDP stimulus package aimed (mostly) at infrastructure; the United States has enacted a two-year $800 billion spending and tax rebate package.
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered short-term interest-rate targets to near zero and are adopting “quantitative easing” – i.e., continuous infusions of money.
Despite all this, massive excess bank reserves remain unlent.
During Japan’s “lost decade,” the Bank of Japan mostly bought Japanese government bonds, whereas the Fed is trying to reopen secondary markets for securitized private lending (which in the US is as important as bank lending), buying mortgage-backed securities and consumer and business loans, as well as U.S. Treasury bonds.
The Bank of England is buying UK government bonds (“gilts”).
The European Central Bank, reflecting a strong inflation concern, has responded more slowly.
The US government is now insuring, lending or spending over $10 trillion from guaranteeing money market funds to the AIG bailout to the Fed’s swap lines supporting foreign central banks.
Analogous guarantees and bank bailouts have occurred in the other major economies (the ECB does not play this role for Europe; national governments do).
The fiscal response – tax cuts and spending increases – has varied considerably, being somewhat more tepid in debt-averse Europe than in the US and China.
The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus, while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation.
Will near-zero interest rates, financial-sector bailouts, and fiscal stimulus work?
What else could be done?
As for fiscal measures, the empirical evidence suggests that three-quarters of consumption is based on longer-term economic prospects, not short-run disposable income.
Thus, temporary tax rebates are mostly saved, not spent.
Targeting liquidity-constrained people, especially the unemployed, is a bit more effective, as well as humane. 
Some claim that infrastructure spending creates a big Keynesian “multiplier,” a bigger increase in incomes than the initial spending (estimates range up to about 1.5 times the initial increase in spending).
But infrastructure spending is usually slow – and almost always driven heavily by parochial political considerations.
Japan’s annual 15-20 trillion yen infrastructure-intensive stimulus didn’t prevent its lost decade.
Nor did American government spending end the Great Depression (unemployment was still over 15% in 1939, a decade after the depression’s onset).
A more effective stimulus would speed up spending that needs to be done anyway.  Or cut taxes to change the marginal calculus of firms on layoffs and consumers on spending – for example, by suspending the payroll tax on firms and workers for a year or suspending part or all of the sales tax or national value-added tax.
Better yet would be permanent rate reductions and controls on future spending.
But governments should be wary of expensive fiscal stimulus.
It is likely to yield little cushion for employment and income per dollar spent, while servicing the large debt accumulation will impede long-run growth, either by forcing substantial future tax increases or spending cuts, or by forcing central banks to inflate.
Indeed, China frets over the safety of the US Treasury bonds that it holds.
In theory, enough quantitative easing implies future inflation, motivating people to buy big-ticket items, like cars and appliances, now to avoid the run-up in prices later.
(In practice, it is an experiment.)
High and rising inflation creates great costs and is difficult to reverse.
After mitigating the downturn, central bankers must withdraw the immense infusion of liquidity before inflation takes off, a tricky maneuver.
The bottom line, though, is that better policies can at best mitigate the economic consequences of this horrible recession.
We will not get out of this mess completely any time soon.
Sometimes, strong recoveries follow recessions, but recovery following financial crises is always immensely painful, time-consuming, and traumatic.
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have argued that the major financial crises of the last century typically lasted a half-decade or longer.
In many of the previous banking crises, it was a country or a region that was hit hard (Argentina, Japan, etc.).
This time, virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global.
Policymakers will continue to throw whatever ammunition they can find at the problem, but it will take time for the deleveraging from the boom to run its course.
At times of serious economic distress, policymakers thrash about seeking solutions, and some people lose confidence in the economic system itself.
Indeed, in the Great Depression of the 1930’s, it was common for Western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea.
Some never returned from that intellectual journey, despite the collapse of communism.
There is, of course, no case for going back to socialism and central planning.
Once off government lifelines, we will need a better-regulated financial system.
Any financial institution that is too big or too interconnected to fail, or could quickly become so, must be closely regulated and monitored for risk and capital adequacy in real time, or be broken up into smaller firms.
In the meantime, let’s hope that Messrs. Bernanke, King, Trichet, and the world’s other central bank governors get monetary policy roughly right, and that our politicians don’t waste vast sums on ineffective fiscal stimulus.
A Global Strategy for Disaster Risk
SENDAI – Current disaster-risk levels are alarming.
The cost of damage to commercial and residential buildings worldwide is averaging $314 billion each year, with the private sector bearing as much as 85% of that price tag.
At the same time, a new United Nations report shows that annual investments in disaster-risk reduction of $6 billion can result in savings of up to $360 billion.
Hundreds of business executives, aware of the dramatic costs – and potential benefits – at stake, are now preparing to attend a UN conference on disaster-risk reduction in Sendai, Japan.
A decade ago, when the last such gathering was held, the private sector was scarcely represented.
This time, companies and entrepreneurs will be there in full force to explore a range of valuable opportunities.
The Tohoku region of Japan, where the meeting will take place, is a vivid reminder of how a disaster's economic impact reverberates far beyond its epicenter.
Devastated four years ago by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, Japan's automobile production was cut by nearly half.
The financial damage did not stop at the country's borders; as a direct result of the slowdown in Japan, automobile production dropped by some 20% in Thailand, 50% in China, and 70% in India.
The risks inherent in globalized production carry great rewards for those who know how to manage them properly.
That is why major businesses such as PricewaterHouseCoopers, Hindustan Construction Corporation, AbzeSolar, Swiss Re, AECOM, AXA Group, IBM, and others – spanning many sectors and encompassing all regions – are engaging with UN experts to improve global strategies for disaster-risk management and reduction.
This level of business engagement bodes well for pioneering a new planet-friendly and people-sensitive approach to global prosperity.
Indeed, the disaster-risk reduction conference in Sendai is the first in a series of major international gatherings this year.
Beyond Sendai, world leaders will convene in Addis Ababa in July to discuss financing for development, in New York in September to adopt a new development agenda, and in Paris in December to reach a meaningful climate-change agreement.
Taken together, these meetings promise to generate transformative action that can set the world on a safer, more prosperous, and more sustainable path.
Sustainability starts in Sendai for three major reasons.
First, by its very nature, disaster-risk reduction requires forward planning.
Second, investment in this area advances both sustainable development and climate action.
And, third, helping those who are most vulnerable to disasters is the ideal starting point for the effort to aid all people by establishing universal targets for development and climate change.
Over the last 12 months, thousands of lives were saved in India, the Philippines, and elsewhere by improved weather forecasting, early-warning systems, and evacuation plans.
Advances in risk reduction that safeguard development gains and business investments must match this progress in disaster preparedness, and we must make wise choices that create greater opportunities in the future.
For example, experts estimate that 60% of the land that will be urbanized by 2030 has not yet been developed.
Enterprises that factor disaster risk into their construction plans will avert the much higher costs of retrofitting later.
More broadly, over the next 15 years, the world will make major investments in urban infrastructure, energy, and agriculture.
If this spending is directed toward low-carbon goods, technologies, and services, we will be on our way to creating more resilient societies.
More and more industries appreciate this.
At the Climate Summit that I convened last September at the UN in New York, financial institutions, commercial and national banks, insurance companies, and pension funds vowed to mobilize more than $200 billion by the end of this year for action to address climate change.
They envisioned a host of new initiatives, including issuing so-called green bonds and shifting assets to clean-energy portfolios.
In a particularly important move, the insurance industry, representing $30 trillion in assets and investments, committed to creating a Climate Risk Investment Framework for industry-wide adoption by the end of the year.
It is time to stop addressing development and humanitarian emergencies separately.
Disaster-risk reduction lies at the nexus of development assistance, which seeks to advance better living conditions, and humanitarian aid, which begins after a disaster hits.
Starting our international calendar with the Sendai meeting on disaster-risk reduction sends a clear signal that the world is ready to integrate its strategies.
I have seen the human toll of disasters – from earthquakes in China and Haiti to floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh to Superstorm Sandy, which affected the Caribbean and North America, even inundating the lower floors of the UN facilities in New York.
When business, civil society, and government team up to help countries withstand disasters, they save lives, boost stability, and create opportunities that enable markets and people alike to flourish.
Sustainable profits.
Sustainable livelihoods.
Sustainable development.
It all starts in Sendai.
Global Economic Cooperation or Bust
According to estimates by the United Nations, the global economy expanded by 3.8% last year, continuing the strong performance recorded since 2003.
Led by China and India, developing countries were prominent among the best performing economies, expanding by 6.5% on average in 2006.
But can this apparently benign pattern of global growth be sustained, particularly since growth has been accompanied by ever-widening global financial imbalances?
Average annual growth in the least developed countries, many in Africa, reached almost 7% last year.
The world’s largest economy, the United States, expanded by 3.2 %, and growth also recovered in previously sluggish Japan and Europe.
These trends are remarkable in light of the shocks from the surge in oil prices, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, international terrorism, and the breakdown of multilateral trade negotiations.
Strong economic performance reflects strong domestic demand in the US, owing to low borrowing costs and rising asset prices.
This lifted manufactured exports around the world and kept inflation down, which in turn boosted demand for energy and raw materials from the developing world, pushing up commodity prices and benefiting many poor countries.
The savings generated in East Asia and the major oil exporters have increased global liquidity, helping to finance the US current account deficit, which has now reached unprecedented levels.
But the outlook for 2007 is for weakening global economic growth.
The UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects 2007 cautions that a weaker housing market will undermine US growth.
Consequently, global economic expansion will slow, as no other major country is set to take over as the main engine of growth.
With slowing world economic growth, US financing needs could cause a drop in investors’ confidence in the future of US-based assets, precipitating a sharp dollar depreciation.
The UN report observes that national economic policies and existing multilateral settings are not designed to mitigate effectively the risk of a global slowdown or to address global imbalances.
In Europe and Japan, for example, monetary and fiscal policies have been tightening in response to domestic concerns, further slowing the world economy.
The build-up of official reserves in East Asia and other developing countries will provide them with extra means to deal with possible external shocks.
However, it has also limited the expansion of domestic demand and import growth, exacerbating rather than redressing the global imbalances.
Of course, no single government can bear all the costs of the policies needed to correct today’s global imbalances.
But an internationally agreed set of policies could help reduce the risk of weaker growth in the major economies, maintain confidence in the stability of international financial markets, and avoid a hard landing for the dollar.
This would require, for instance, stimulating growth in Europe, Asia, and the major oil exporters in order to offset the contractionary effect on the world economy of adjustment in the US, which should include more restrictive fiscal policies, less private consumption, and higher domestic savings to reduce its external deficit.
Exchange rates should be realigned in a coordinated fashion to stimulate exports from deficit countries and import demand from surplus countries.
This is not just a matter of revaluing the Chinese currency, as argued by some US policymakers, but requires gradual adjustment of most major currencies against the dollar in conjunction with concerted fiscal and monetary policy adjustments in the rest of the world.
Existing platforms, such as the G-8 summits, are unsuitable to achieve this course of action, mainly because key players from the developing world are not included.
The multilateral surveillance mechanisms launched last year by the IMF are a step in the right direction, but only if they become part of an institutionalized multilateral mechanism of surveillance and policy coordination.
To be credible as a mediator of this mechanism, the IMF itself would need reform, including a substantial change of voting power to bring the influence of developing countries in line with the weight they carry nowadays in the global economy.
Modest steps in that direction were taken during the IMF meetings in Singapore last September.
Such a new platform should also be used to work towards structural reform of the international monetary system aimed at reducing its excessive reliance on the US dollar as a reserve currency.
Such reforms should work towards developing a multilaterally agreed multi-currency reserve system or even, in the longer term, a world currency based on the Special Drawing Rights issued by the IMF.
The mere possibility of an imminent hard landing for the dollar – and with it, for the US and world economy – should be alarming enough to mobilize concerted action.
Coordination will surely deliver more satisfactory outcomes than what any one country can achieve on its own.
Try Everything
BERKELEY – When it became clear in late 2008 that the global economy was headed toward a crash at least as dangerous as the one that had initiated the Great Depression, I was alarmed, but also hopeful.
We had, after all, seen this before.
And we also had a model for how to mitigate the damage; unfortunately, policymakers left it on the shelf.
For three and a half years following the start of the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover’s top priority was to balance the budget, trying – but ultimately failing – to restore business confidence.
In 1933, newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed course, adopting a simple yet radical strategy: try everything that might boost demand, increase production, or reduce unemployment – and then keep doing the things that work.
Roosevelt abandoned attempts to balance the budget, increased the money supply, and initiated deficit spending.
He took the United States off the gold standard, had the government hire workers directly, and offered loan guarantees to those in danger of losing their homes.
He cartelized the oil industry and instituted aggressive antitrust policies to break up monopolies.
To be sure, Roosevelt’s New Deal policies sometimes conflicted with one another, and quite a few of them were counterproductive.
But, by trying everything, and then scaling up the most successful policies, Roosevelt was ultimately able to turn the economy around.
And so, in late 2008, the way forward seemed obvious: recapitalize the banks, guarantee loans, use the government-backed housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resolve underwater mortgages, drop short-term interest rates to zero and use quantitative easing to prevent deflation or dangerously low inflation, and embrace deficit spending.
Then, as events evolved, we would reinforce those policies that seemed to be working and gradually drop those that seemed to be ineffective or counterproductive.
But that was not what we did.
Instead, each proposal faced its own opposition.
Some worried that recapitalizing the banks would reward the very institutions that had caused the problem.
Others fretted that resolving underwater mortgages would reward feckless borrowers.
Still others raised concerns about expansionary fiscal and monetary policy.
And some favored one set of polices (say, resolving underwater mortgages and recapitalizing the banks), while opposing all the others (for example, deficit spending and raising inflation expectations).
Six years on, the economy has yet to fully recover and the problem persists.
In an article published on Christmas Day in the Wall Street Journal, the usually wise economist Martin Feldstein makes the case for a set of policies designed to stimulate demand, including increasing investment tax credits and shifting the corporate-tax burden to firms that do not spend very much.
Feldstein’s ideas are promising; and, in line with the lessons of the Great Depression, they are definitely worth trying.
The trouble is the rhetoric surrounding his proposals.
The article’s headline, “The Fed’s Needless Flirtation With Danger,” is followed by warnings that quantitative easing could “increase the risk of financial instability.”
Instead of simply promoting his policies, Feldstein presents them as a “safe and effective alternative” to other approaches.
His proposals, he argues, are not an additional arrow in the quiver, but replacements for “traditional Keynesian policies&hellip;[that] increase budget deficits and national debt.”
The result is that Feldstein’s contribution to solving our economic difficulties is, at best, unproductive.
Though he presumably hopes that his commentary will increase the likelihood that his preferred policies are adopted, the more likely real-world effect will be to diminish support for existing policies without marshaling support for a coalition that can implement effective replacements.
I would be remiss if I did not note that I have sometimes been part of the problem.
When I look back at everything I have written since 2008, I find that I, too, have sometimes been too ready to push my favorite recipes at the expense of others.
As policymakers continue to seek a path out of the ongoing malaise, it would be wise to remember Roosevelt’s words before he led the US out of a very similar crisis.
“The country needs and&hellip;demands bold, persistent experimentation,” he said in 1932.
“Take a method and try it.
If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another.
But above all, try something.”
New Year’s Resolutions for the Global Economy
STANFORD – Over the last year, global growth has been anemic – and the forecast is only slightly better for 2016.
Something must be done to boost incomes and expand opportunities for people everywhere.
Here are some economic resolutions that could bring good cheer in the new year and beyond.
Let us begin in Europe.
Despite the European Central Bank’s monetary accommodation, a sharp depreciation of the euro, and negative short-term interest rates, the European economy remains in the doldrums.
In 2016, Europe’s leaders must stop expecting monetary policy to solve their problems, and instead pursue faster, firmer resolutions to the myriad crises they face, from the intertwined growth, banking, currency, and governance crises to the escalating refugee crisis, which is threatening free movement across internal borders.
They must pursue supply-side fiscal, structural, labor-market, and regulatory reforms, with common-sense solutions for the struggling periphery economies’ fiscal crises and the stronger economies’ medium-term debt woes topping the agenda.
In Latin America, the situation is more varied.
After a decade of progress (with some exceptions, notably Venezuela), the region is facing serious challenges, stemming partly from a sharp decline in global commodity prices.
Indeed, plummeting oil prices helped to push the region’s largest economy, Brazil, into its worst recession in decades, while a major corruption scandal at Petrobras, the state oil company, has thrown the country’s politics into disarray, with President Dilma Rousseff now facing impeachment.
This makes the pursuit of economy-saving resolutions exceedingly difficult.
The new leftist finance minister will probably make things worse.
Political instability is undermining economic prospects elsewhere, too.
In Ecuador, where President Rafael Correa, who seems intent on imitating Venezuelan Chavismo, has eliminated term limits on his office, high inflation is a growing risk.
In Latin America’s second- and third-largest economies, however, new leadership offers reason for hope.
President Enrique Peña Nieto’s decision to open Mexico’s deep-water oil deposits to international energy companies will help the country overcome declining production, lagging technology, and corruption at Pemex, the national oil company.
Nieto also recognizes the imperative of improving Mexico’s education system, and thus is taking on the powerful teachers’ union.
In Argentina, newly elected President Mauricio Macri is nothing like his anti-business, anti-American predecessor Cristina Kirchner, who pillaged the central bank, channeling funds toward favored local governments, and even fudged national statistics to obscure skyrocketing inflation.
Among Macri’s resolutions are market-oriented reforms, and clearing the many economic land mines that Kirchner planted.
He is off to a good start, having freed the peso from its official peg, reduced taxes, and moved toward freer trade.
Venezuela also has reason for hope.
The opposition, having won a supermajority in parliament, defeating the ruling socialists for the first time in 17 years, should be able to limit the harm caused by the policies of President Nicolás Maduro, heir to Hugo Chávez.
But if opposition forces are to turn the economy around, they will need to win the presidency in 2019.
In Asia, all eyes are on China, the epicenter of a growth slowdown that has reverberated throughout the region (and beyond).
The remarkable growth spurt of the last three decades has degraded the natural environment considerably, produced vast excess capacity in basic industries like cement and steel, and left the banking system saddled with bad loans.
China’s government has committed to reform, but its efforts are lagging.
The rebalancing of its economy from exports to domestic demand remains a major challenge, not least because its consumers are slow to cooperate.
And the government maintains significant control over major companies, even some that are listed on public stock markets.
To engineer the soft landing that Asia needs, China’s leaders must redouble their reform efforts.
One key resolution should be to dispense state-owned companies’ profits directly to the population, to consume the proceeds or invest them elsewhere.
Japan, for its part, has sunk back into recession, despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s large and costly economic-revitalization strategy.
The Japanese, like many of their neighbors, hope that enactment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal – which would, among other things, lower tariffs on thousands of commodities and reduce non-tariff barriers – will provide a much-needed boost.
Africa has been a less visible success story in the last decade.
Despite the many difficulties the continent faces, foreign investment and trade (not aid) provide major opportunities for growth and development.
A resolution to break the scientifically illiterate opposition to genetically modified food would help boost agriculture and exports to Europe substantially.
In North America, Canada’s new center-left prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be tempted to expand government spending and regulation. But he must not loosen the strings of the public purse too much.
Thanks to the collapse in oil prices, western Canada is in the early stages of a serious downturn.
Fortunately, there is room for Trudeau to meet the demands of his supporters, without wasteful spending.
To this end, he should press America’s next president to pursue the implementation of the TPP in a way that protects NAFTA; to maintain a sound monetary policy; and to reverse President Barack Obama’s veto of the Keystone Pipeline.
These steps would also be in the interest of the United States.
In fact, US efforts to promote free trade should go beyond the TPP to target the revitalization of the moribund Doha Round of multilateral trade liberalization.
Both monetary- and fiscal-policy normalization are critical.
And the US must capitalize on its expanded energy production, such as by enabling exports of oil and natural gas, to reduce its European allies’ dependence on Russian energy.
But perhaps America’s most important New Year’s resolution should be to return to global leadership – a role that has gradually eroded over the last decade, with devastating consequences.
That erosion, rooted in deep political fissures that are evident in the current presidential election campaign, is disturbing global economic, financial, and security arrangements that depend on American leadership.
The US may have a lot on its plate, but unless it leads effectively, the challenges it faces will only grow.
The Global Economy’s Marshmallow Test
NEW YORK – The world economy is experiencing a turbulent start to 2016.
Stock markets are plummeting; emerging economies are reeling in response to the sharp decline in commodities prices; refugee inflows are further destabilizing Europe; China’s growth has slowed markedly in response to a capital-flow reversal and an overvalued currency; and the US is in political paralysis.
A few central bankers struggle to keep the world economy upright.
To escape this mess, four principles should guide the way.
First, global economic progress depends on high global saving and investment.
Second, saving and investment flows should be viewed as global, not national.
Third, full employment depends on high investment rates that match high saving rates.
Fourth, high private investments by business depend on high public investments in infrastructure and human capital.
Let’s consider each.
First, our global goal should be economic progress, meaning better living conditions worldwide.
Indeed, that goal has been enshrined in the new Sustainable Development Goals adopted last September by all 193 members of the United Nations.
Progress depends on a high rate of global investment: building the skills, technology, and physical capital stock to propel standards of living higher.
In economic development, as in life, there’s no free lunch: Without high rates of investment in know-how, skills, machinery, and sustainable infrastructure, productivity tends to decline (mainly through depreciation), dragging down living standards.
High investment rates in turn depend on high saving rates.
A famous psychological experiment found that young children who could resist the immediate temptation to eat a marshmallow, and thereby gain two marshmallows in the future, were likelier to thrive as adults than those who couldn’t.
Likewise, societies that defer instant consumption in order to save and invest for the future will enjoy higher future incomes and greater retirement security.
(When American economists advise China to boost consumption and cut saving, they are merely peddling the bad habits of American culture, which saves and invests far too little for America’s future.)
Second, saving and investment flows are global.
A country such as China, with a high saving rate that exceeds local investment needs, can support investment in other parts of the world that save less, notably low-income Africa and Asia.
China’s population is aging rapidly, and Chinese households are saving for retirement.
The Chinese know that their household financial assets, rather than numerous children or government social security, will be the main source of their financial security.
Low-income Africa and Asia, on the other hand, are both capital-poor and very young.
They can borrow from China’s high savers to finance a massive and rapid build-up of education, skills, and infrastructure to underpin their own future economic prosperity.
Third, a high global saving rate does not automatically translate into a high investment rate; unless properly directed, it can cause underspending and unemployment instead.
Money put into banks and other financial intermediaries (such as pension and insurance funds) can finance productive activities or short-term speculation (for example, consumer loans and real estate).
Great bankers of the past like J.P. Morgan built industries like rail and steel.
Today’s money managers, by contrast, tend to resemble gamblers or even fraudsters like Charles Ponzi.
Fourth, today’s investments with high social returns – such as low-carbon energy, smart power grids for cities, and information-based health systems – depend on public-private partnerships, in which public investment and public policies help to spur private investment.
This has long been the case: Railroad networks, aviation, automobiles, semiconductors, satellites, GPS, hydraulic fracturing, nuclear power, genomics, and the Internet would not exist but for such partnerships (typically, but not only, starting with the military).
Our global problem today is that the world’s financial intermediaries are not properly steering long-term saving into long-term investments.
The problem is compounded by the fact that most governments (the US is a stark case) are chronically underinvesting in long-term education, skill training, and infrastructure.
Private investment is falling short mainly because of the shortfall of complementary public investment.
Shortsighted macroeconomists say the world is under-consuming; in fact, it is underinvesting.
The result is inadequate global demand (global investments falling short of global saving at full employment) and highly volatile short-term capital flows to finance consumption and real estate.
Such short-term flows are subject to abrupt reversals of size and direction.
The 1997 Asian financial crisis followed a sudden stop of capital inflows to Asia, and global short-term lending suddenly dried up after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, causing the Great Recession.
Now China is facing the same problem, with inflows having abruptly given way to outflows.
The mainstream macroeconomic advice to China – boost domestic consumption and overvalue the renminbi to cut exports – fails the marshmallow test.
It encourages overconsumption, underinvestment, and rising unemployment in a rapidly aging society, and in a world that can make tremendous use of China’s high saving and industrial capacity.
The right policy is to channel China’s high saving to increased investments in infrastructure and skills in low-income Africa and Asia.
China’s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and its One Belt, One Road initiative to establish modern transport and communications links throughout the region are steps in the right direction.
These programs will keep China’s factories operating at high capacity to produce the investment goods needed for rapid growth in today’s low-income countries.
China’s currency should be allowed to depreciate so that China’s capital-goods exports to Africa and Asia are more affordable.
More generally, governments should expand the role of national and multilateral development banks (including the regional development banks for Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Islamic countries) to channel long-term saving from pension funds, insurance funds, and commercial banks into long-term public and private investments in twenty-first-century industries and infrastructure.
Central banks and hedge funds cannot produce long-term economic growth and financial stability.
Only long-term investments, both public and private, can lift the world economy out of its current instability and slow growth.
The Economic Consequences of Drug Resistance
LONDON – When British Prime Minister David Cameron asked me in July to lead an effort to find solutions to the growing global problem of antimicrobial resistance, my first question was: “What is that?”
I soon learned that, as bacteria and parasites develop resistance to existing drugs, like antibiotics and antimalarial medications, the world is at risk of losing its battle against infectious diseases.
So my next question was: “Why me?
Don’t you need a scientist?”
It turns out that the problem of rising antimicrobial resistance is as much about economics as it is about science or medicine.
Left unchecked, it will kill millions of people every year, and have serious adverse economic consequences for the world.
For developing economies, including most of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) countries, the risk is particularly large.
Recent research, by an independent review on antimicrobial resistance, which I chair, has modeled the phenomenon’s likely impact on the world economy.
It suggests that if we fail to address antimicrobial resistance, the problem will grow worse.
By 2020, if we allow resistance to rise by 40%, global GDP will be 0.5% smaller than it otherwise would have been.
By 2030, it will be 1.4% smaller.
By 2050, the economic shortfall will reach 3%.
The accumulated loss of global output over the next 35 years will total $100 trillion – more than one and a half times annual world GDP today.
Already, 60,000 people die every year from causes related to antimicrobial resistance in the United States and Europe – some ten times the worldwide death toll from the ongoing Ebola crisis.
By 2050, if the problem is allowed to continue to grow, antimicrobial resistance will kill more than ten million people per year.
That is more than the number of people who currently die of cancer, and greater than the number of deaths from&nbsp;diabetes, lung cancer, road traffic accidents, diarrhoeal disease, and HIV combined.
The economic costs from the resulting panic, including a collapse of travel and trade, could be devastating.
Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance will have a particularly severe impact on India, Indonesia, and Nigeria (as well as the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa).
Countries like China and Brazil, which have been successful in reducing malaria rates, could see their hard work undermined by an increase in resistance to antimalarial drugs.
The research we commissioned was based on the limited data available.
It does not take into account the damage from drug-resistant illnesses outside of hospitals or the impact of escalating healthcare costs.
Nor does it include the drop in living standards from the loss of life-enhancing treatments – for example, knee or hip replacements, cancer treatment, and caesarean sections – that rely on antibiotics to prevent infections.
The broad-brush research we conducted shows that such treatments – many of which would not be possible without effective antibiotics – add around 4% of benefit in terms of GDP.
One of my goals is to persuade policymakers at the United Nations to agree to a set of rules and policies to stop the growth of antimicrobial resistance.
In addition to highlighting the scale of the problem, the review is seeking to find ways to reduce drug resistance and to stimulate the production of new antibiotics to compensate for the loss of those that are now or will become ineffective.
Some solutions to reduce resistance will require cutting-edge technology.
We must encourage policymakers to support the development of the best diagnostics.
Quicker, more accurate diagnoses will curb the current overreliance on antibiotics – a key requirement for combating resistance.
We also must develop tools to identify and halt outbreaks of resistant diseases at an early stage.
Data provided by diagnostic devices could be a potent weapon in containing these outbreaks.
Other solutions are low tech, requiring little more than common sense.
We need to start washing our hands thoroughly and often.
We need to stop demanding antibiotics from our doctors.
And, when antibiotics are called for, we need to finish the prescribed course.
As we try to prevent resistance to existing drugs, we will also need to examine the impact of antibiotics in agriculture.
Developing new antibiotics is a challenge, because pharmaceutical companies seem to need incentives to conduct the required research.
The review will study whether market incentives can be changed.
If they cannot, more dramatic alternatives to boost early innovation by university labs and small companies could be sought, perhaps through a targeted fund.
As the review research shows, the stakes of inaction on antimicrobial resistance are high.
Now is the time to search for bold, clear, and practical long-term solutions.
Are the Good Times Over?
STANFORD – In the 25 years before the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the United States experienced two brief, mild recessions and two strong, long expansions.
Globally, incomes grew briskly; inflation abated; and stock markets boomed.
Moreover, the recovery from the last major slump, in the early 1980s, brought about a quarter-century of unprecedentedly strong and stable macroeconomic performance.
This time, however, the return to growth has been much more difficult.
America’s recovery since the Great Recession, has been inconsistent, with growth repeatedly picking up and then sputtering out.
In fact, the US has not experienced three consecutive quarters of 3% growth in a decade.
Though lower oil prices are helping consumers, this gain is partly offset by less energy investment, and the effects of the stronger dollar will be even larger.
The US is not alone. Though most European economies are now growing again, aided by lower oil prices and currency depreciation, the pace of expansion remains anemic.
Similarly, Japan’s recovery remains fragile, despite strong efforts by the government. Even the major emerging economies, which were supposed to serve as global growth engines in the years ahead, are struggling: China and India have downshifted, and Brazil and Russia are contracting.
When a boom or bust lasts for such a long time, it begins to seem like it will continue indefinitely.
Six years after the crisis, some prominent economists are asking whether insufficient investment and/or waning gains from technological innovation have pushed the global economy into a “new normal” of lower growth and slow, if any, gains in living standards.
Some economists call this “secular stagnation” – a fancy way of saying that the good times are gone for good.
Are they right?
Total economic growth amounts to roughly the sum of the growth of work hours (an increase in the number of workers or the amount of hours that they work) and productivity (output per hour of work).
If productivity improves by one percentage point in a year, the improvement of living standards over the subsequent generation would be augmented by one-third.
Over time, a productivity improvement of even a fraction of a percentage point would be immensely consequential.
Productivity can be enhanced by capital investment, technological innovation, and improvements in the knowledge and skills of the labor force, though economists disagree on which has the largest impact.
According to my research with Larry Lau, technology has played the largest role boosting productivity in the G-7 economies since World War II.
Given this, America’s declining productivity growth – which has averaged just 0.7% annually since 2010 – has led some observers to blame the slowdown on inadequate technological advances.
These pessimists, such as the economist Robert Gordon, claim that new innovations are unlikely to improve productivity as fundamentally as electricity, automobiles, and computers did in the last century.
Optimists counter that smart phones, Big Data, and expected advances in nanotechnology, robotics, and biosciences are harbingers of a new era of technology-driven productivity improvements.
It may be impossible to predict the next “killer app,” they argue, but it will always be developed.
Both sides cite Moore’s Law, named for Intel’s co-founder, Gordon Moore, who noticed that the density of transistors on a chip could be doubled every 18 months.
The pessimists claim that this is becoming harder and more expensive; the optimists hold that the law will remain valid, with chips moving to three dimensions.
Clearly, the trajectory of technological progress is difficult to predict.
In fact, the main commercial value of new technology is not always apparent even to the inventor.
When Guglielmo Marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission over a century ago, he was competing with the telegraph in point-to-point communication; he never envisioned popular mass-broadcast radio.
Thomas Edison designed the phonograph to help the blind – and filed a lawsuit to prevent it from being used to play music.
Complicating matters further is the fact that the next wave of productivity-enhancing technological developments are likely to occur in sectors such as health care, where their economic impact is difficult to measure.
Economists believe that many improvements in health-care quality – such as more effective treatments for cataracts or cardiac disease – are not accurately reflected in real GDP, and are incorrectly reported as price increases.
Better measures for these changes are essential for an accurate assessment of economic progress.
To be sure, technology-driven growth carries some risks.
While old fears that automation and artificial intelligence would cause widespread structural unemployment have never been borne out, technology and globalization have put downward pressure on wages for all but the most skilled workers in the advanced economies.
Capital’s share of national income has increased, while labor’s share has fallen.
But implementing policies that restrict potentially productivity-enhancing technologies would be a grave mistake.
To encourage more robust growth and the associated improvements in living standards, governments should ensure that the private sector has sufficient incentives for innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in physical and human capital.
For example, officials could cut red tape, rein in deficits and debt, enact tax policies conducive to capital formation, reform the education system, and invest in research and development.
Of course, no one should expect a return to the pre-crisis boom years, given the demographic pressures that almost all major economies – including China – are facing.
But these incentives stand the best chance of continuing the flow of productivity-enhancing technology, from startups to the research divisions of established companies in industries from technology to energy to health care.
In Search of Growth Strategies
MILAN – In 2008, the Commission on Growth and Development, which I had the privilege of chairing, produced a report updating our knowledge about sustainable growth patterns.
Then, as now, one thing is clear: the policies that underpin multi-decade periods of high growth, structural transformation, rising employment and incomes, and dramatic reductions in poverty are mutually reinforcing.
The impact of each is amplified by the others.
They are ingredients in recipes that work – and, as with recipes, missing items can substantially undermine the outcome.
To understand the weak, deteriorating, and fragile growth patterns seen today in many countries and in the global economy as a whole, one should compare what is actually happening with what reasonably comprehensive growth strategies might look like.
Of course, there are many policies that sustain high growth, and to some extent they are country-specific.
But a few key ingredients are common to all known successful cases.
The first is high levels of public and private investment.
In successful developing countries, investment is at or above 30% of GDP.
The public-sector component (infrastructure, human capital, and the economy’s knowledge and technology base) is in the 5-7% range.
And the public- and private-sector investments are complementary: The former raises the rate of return to the latter, and hence its level.
Private domestic and foreign investment is influenced by a host of other factors that affect risks and returns. These include the skills of the workforce, the security of property rights and related legal institutions, ease of doing business (for example, the process and time required for starting a business), and the absence of rigidities in its product and factor markets (those for labor, capital, and raw materials).
Above all, the investment climate is positively influenced by stability – both competent and alert macroeconomic management and political effectiveness and continuity.
Conversely, uncertainty about growth, or the commitment to a reasonably coherent reform agenda, will produce adverse impacts on investment.
A second common ingredient of sustainable growth strategies is that financing these relatively high levels of investment comes from domestic savings.
Substantial reliance on external savings (as reflected in persistent high current-account deficits) seems to end badly – in debt crises and major growth setbacks.
Openness to the global economy with respect to trade and investment is critical as well.
Foreign direct investment, for example, is a key channel for transmitting and adapting the accumulated stock of global technology and knowhow.
And export competitiveness is raised as investment pours into the construction of links in global supply chains.
The capital account is a more complicated story.
Generally, successful developing economies have managed it to prevent excessive volatility, including volatility resulting from external shocks or imbalances and from excessive reliance on external financing.
In addition, most successful countries manage the exchange rate to keep it in line with productivity growth, using a combination of capital controls, monetary policy, and reserve accumulation or decumulation.
Both over- and undervalued currencies have different adverse effects, though persistent overvaluation is more problematic for stability and growth.
Finally, inclusiveness is also a key component of successful development strategies.
Growth patterns that systematically exclude subgroups founder on the loss of political and social cohesion and, ultimately, on the loss of support for the strategy.
By contrast, income inequality that is not too extreme, and that does not arise from corruption or privileged access to markets, is understood and accepted.
The provision of high-quality basic services like education and health care is viewed as crucial for equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility.
Against that backdrop, one can assess current growth patterns in the global economy and its various parts.
For starters, public-sector investment is broadly below levels needed to restore and sustain growth, partly owing to fiscal constraints in overly indebted countries.
Absent defaults, the normal way to reduce sovereign-debt overhangs is with nominal growth.
But growth-oriented policies have been absent, beyond whatever monetary policy can contribute, and inflation is broadly below targets.
And large pools of savings in sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurance companies have not yet been successfully deployed at scale on the public-sector side, presumably because of blockages in the intermediation channels related to risk and incentives.
Private-sector investment (in tangible and intangible assets) is also below growth-sustaining levels (though there are contrary trends in some high-growth technology sectors).
Contributing factors include a shortage of aggregate demand, high levels of uncertainty about policies and regulatory agendas, and growing doubts about key drivers of global growth like China.
In addition, depending on the economy in question, stalled tax reform and policy-induced structural rigidities in product and factor markets are having adverse effects.
With respect to inclusiveness, much useful recent analysis focuses on technology-driven shifts in economic structure and labor markets on the demand side, and globalization, which has left education and skills mismatches on the slower-moving supply side.
Job polarization and rising patterns of income inequality are in part the result of these forces, with adverse effects on final demand and, more important, on the resources that individuals and families have to invest in their own human capital.
In short, a reasonably comprehensive strategy for restoring country-level and global growth would include measures to elevate and remove obstacles to public and private investment, thereby contributing to aggregate demand.
It would also include a variety of reforms to strengthen private investment incentives. And it would include an inclusiveness agenda directed at structural disequilibrium in labor markets and potentially destructive income inequality.
Thus far, with few exceptions, such comprehensive growth strategies have been missing.
If those strategies were not just implemented, but also synchronized across major economies, each would be amplified through positive international spillovers via trade – a clear role for the G-20.
In the absence of such an approach, one can foresee an extended period of low and fragile growth, at best, with downside risks stemming from increased leverage in a prolonged low-interest-rate and deflationary environment.
A worse outcome – and all too plausible – is further deterioration in the political and social cohesion that forms the foundation for vigorous policy responses.
At that point, stagnation becomes a trap.
In Praise of Global Imbalances
SINGAPORE – In recent weeks, there has been a chorus of opinion arguing for a sharp increase in global investment, particularly in infrastructure.
Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers asserted that public investment really is a free lunch, while IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has argued that an investment boost is needed if the world economy is to “overcome a new mediocre.”
These comments suggest that the world has been under-investing for many years.
In fact, according to International Monetary Fund data, the current overall global investment rate, at 24.5% of world GDP, is near the top of its long-term range.
The issue is not a lack of overall investment, but the fact that a disproportionate share of it comes from China.
China’s share of world investment has soared from 4.3% in 1995 to an estimated 25.8% this year.
By contrast, the United States’ share, which peaked at 36% in 1985, has fallen to less than 18%.
The decline in Japan’s share has been more dramatic, from a peak of 22% in 1993 to just 5.7% in 2013.
China dominates global investment because it saves and invests nearly half of its $10.5 trillion economy.
But this investment rate is likely to decline sharply over the next 5-10 years, because the country already boasts new infrastructure, has excess manufacturing capacity in many sectors, and is trying to shift economic activity to services – which require less investment.
Moreover, China’s rapidly aging population and declining working-age population will reduce long-term investment demand.
Because the current-account balance is the difference between the investment and savings rates, the decline in investment will generate large surpluses unless savings also decline.
And the experience of other aging societies, such as Germany and Japan, suggests that domestic investment falls faster than savings rates.
Thus, China can expect large external surpluses to transform the country from the world’s workshop into its main financier.
Indeed, the scale of capital outflows could be so large that long-term capital will remain cheap even after the world’s major central banks tighten monetary policy. How the world absorbs those surpluses will define the next period of global economic expansion.
Emerging markets may be able to take some advantage of this low-cost financing.
India would undoubtedly benefit, though it is unlikely to absorb a significant portion of China’s excess savings.
India’s share of world investment is only 3.4%; and even a large expansion will not compensate for a small decline in Chinese investment.
Furthermore, East Asia’s growth model has been sustained ultimately by mobilizing rising domestic savings and pumping out exports.
So, although India might initially absorb some international capital, it might ultimately prefer to build foreign reserves by running small external deficits or even a surplus.
Other emerging countries are also unlikely to absorb much of China’s capital.
Notwithstanding its advocacy of public investment spending, even the IMF accepts that a sudden increase in public investment is more likely to cause developing-country indebtedness than growth.
That is why calls by the IMF and others to scale up public infrastructure spending are really aimed at developed countries.
Yet this, too, may prove insufficient.
Germany’s investment-savings gap is so large that, even if it increases domestic investment, the most we can expect from Europe is that it does not add to the global savings glut.
Only a revival in US infrastructure investment can create a sustained global economic recovery.
The US has the necessary scale to absorb China’s surplus, and its inadequate infrastructure provides plenty of avenues for fruitful investment.
Ironically, the IMF’s new investment mantra ultimately leads back to large global imbalances.
But, far from decrying this as a major failure of global policy coordination, economists should accept imbalances as the natural state of the world and try to manage the resulting distortions.
Indeed, almost every period of globalization and prosperity has been accompanied by symbiotic imbalances.
They have always caused economic distortions and political complaints, but many have endured for surprisingly long periods.
Consider, for example, the Indo-Roman trade that drove the world economy in the first and second centuries AD.
India ran a current-account surplus while the Romans complained about the loss of gold, yet the system endured.
Similarly, the first Bretton Woods system was sustained with European capital, and Bretton Woods 2 was fueled by Asian capital, with the US providing the deficits in both cases.
There is no reason why Bretton Woods 3 should not experience similar imbalances.
But if, for whatever reason, the global economy fails to take off, we will have to reconcile ourselves to a long period of mediocre growth in which cheap capital depresses yields, drives up asset prices, inflates bubbles, and seeks out trophy assets.
These are not the sort of imbalances to which the world’s policymakers should aspire.
Out of Ammunition to Combat Recession?
STANFORD – Economic forecasts for 2017 project continued frailty in the global economy, and subpar growth for most countries and regions.
Obvious economic problems include Europe’s weak banks, China’s distorted property market, political uncertainty in the West, historically high private and public debt – 225% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund – and the reluctance of heavily indebted Greece and Portugal to comply with IMF programs.
Additional global economic risks, such as a major oil-market disruption that could drive prices up, are not as obvious, and thus receive less attention.
Economists call such events “shocks” precisely because they come unexpectedly and can have far-reaching consequences.
Unprecedented long-term monetary stimulus and massive spikes in public-debt burdens have left governments poorly equipped to manage the next economic downturn when – not if – it arrives.
The next recession probably will not be as bad as the last one, but advanced economies will be far better prepared for it if they undergo gradual monetary-policy normalization and fiscal consolidation in the meantime.
With respect to monetary policy, the United States’ unemployment rate, at around 5%, is close to what most economists consider full employment, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its target interest rate again in December. But the Fed is moving at a very slow pace.
The European Central Bank will likely extend its bond-purchasing program; but it has reason to question the results of its quantitative-easing policy, given that eurozone unemployment still averages around 10%, indicating a sizeable output gap.
Meanwhile, the Japanese economy continues to limp along, with the Bank of Japan now “managing the yield curve” in yet another attempt to raise inflation and growth from their current low levels.
In terms of fiscal policy, most advanced economies’ public finances are suffering because policymakers have failed to implement sufficient supply-side structural reforms to control public-pension growth, reform growth-inhibiting taxes, and liberalize labor markets.
These fiscal-policy failures have put too much of the burden on central banks, even though growth would more likely accelerate with productivity-enhancing supply-side measures.
Lately, the economists who are most influential with left-leaning politicians seem hopeful that growth, employment, and incomes will rise if policymakers embrace massive new deficit-financed spending to create demand for goods and services.
They argue that with borrowing costs so low, deficit spending is virtually free, and we need not worry about high debt levels.
But this argument ignores the typically large gap between what economists devise and what politicians promise, and what public-spending programs actually deliver.
As ECB President Mario Draghi has put it, “There aren’t many public investments with a high rate of return.”
Governments should certainly cut taxes and fund initiatives that pass rigorous cost-benefit tests; but broad new spending programs usually do not yield a significant or immediate economic boost.
For starters, spending generally occurs well into the future, when economic conditions are projected to be better.
As President Barack Obama, referring to his signature 2009 stimulus bill, eventually admitted, “the shovels weren’t ready.”
Similarly, Japan has attempted government spending stimulus for decades, with little to show for it in terms of overall economic growth.
To be sure, large deficits can be benign or even desirable during recessions and wars, or when used to finance productive public investments; and in a deep, long-lasting downturn, with interest rates at or near zero, a well-timed, sensible fiscal response can theoretically help in the short term.
But studies show that the multiplier effect of government spending – when it may increase GDP by more than the expenditure – shrinks rapidly after a few quarters, and then turns negative.
In fact, the multiplier effect can even be negative during economic expansions when central banks maintain zero-interest rates and households expect taxes to rise when interest rates do.
Because new government purchases can devolve into counterproductive political boondoggles that spur little economic growth, another proposal one often hears is to expand government transfer payments.
Leaving aside the fact that transfer payments are already fiscally unsustainable in most countries (because they were adopted and expanded under better economic and demographic conditions), could they lift the economy?
A recent study addresses this very question.
According to former Obama administration Chief Economist Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, even permanent transfer-payment increases provide stimulus for only a few months, and the effect does not spread to employment.
The study concludes that the benefits from transfers are “much less persistent, and much smaller overall, than those of tax changes.”
In economies where stimulus programs are carefully vetted and can be implemented quickly, any temporary government spending should be coupled with gradual fiscal consolidation, to minimize economic risk and long-term costs.
As history and theory indicate, this fiscal consolidation should happen through reduced future spending growth, especially on transfer payments.
Economic policymakers should heed this lesson so that they can gradually re-arm themselves; otherwise, they could be left with no firepower when they most need it.
Two Cheers for the New Normal
JAKARTA – The conventional wisdom about the state of the world economy goes something like this: Since the start of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the developed world has struggled to recover, with only the United States able to adjust.
Emerging countries have fared better, but they, too, have started to flounder lately.
In a bleak economic climate, the argument goes, the only winners have been the wealthy, resulting in skyrocketing inequality.
That scenario sounds entirely right – until, on closer examination, it turns out to be completely wrong.
Start with economic growth.
According to the International Monetary Fund, during the first decade of this century, annual global growth averaged 3.7%, compared to 3.3% in the 1980s and 1990s.
In the last four years, growth has averaged 3.4%.
This is far lower than what many had hoped; in 2010, I predicted that in the coming decade, the world could grow at a 4.1% annual rate.
But 3.4% is hardly disastrous by historical standards.
To be sure, all of the large, developed economies are growing more slowly than they did when their economic engines were roaring.
But it is only the eurozone that has badly disappointed in recent years.
I had assumed, when I made my projections in 2010, that the region’s poor demographics and weak productivity would prevent it from growing at more than 1.5% a year.
Instead, it has managed only a meager 0.3%.
For Japan, the US, and the United Kingdom, the prospects are brighter.
It should be relatively straightforward for them to grow at an average rate that outpaces that of the last decade – a period that includes the peak of the financial crisis.
In addition, the dramatic drop in the price of crude oil will serve as the equivalent of a large tax cut for consumers.
Indeed, I am rather baffled by the IMF’s decision to downgrade its growth forecast for much of the world.
If anything, with oil prices falling, an upward revision seems warranted.
Another factor supporting a more positive outlook is the rebalancing that has occurred between the US and China, the world’s two largest economies.
Each entered the financial crisis with huge current-account imbalances.
The US was running a deficit of more than 6.5% of its GDP, and China had a surplus of close to 10% of its GDP.
Today, the US deficit has fallen to about 2%, and the Chinese surplus is less than 3%.
Given that their intertwined imbalances were key drivers of the financial crisis, this is a welcome development.
It has recently become fashionable to disparage the economic performance of the large emerging countries, particularly China and the other BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, and India).
But it is hardly a surprise that these countries are no longer growing as fast as they once did.
In 2010, I predicted that China’s annual growth would slow to 7.5%.
It has since averaged 8%.
India’s performance has been more discouraging, though growth has picked up since early 2014.
The only real disappointments are Brazil and Russia, both of which have struggled (again, not surprisingly) with much lower commodity prices.
Their lethargic performance, together with the eurozone’s, is the main reason why the world economy has not managed the 4.1% growth that optimists like me thought was feasible.
The conventional wisdom on wealth and inequality is similarly mistaken.
From 2000 to 2014, global GDP more than doubled, from $31.8 trillion to over $75 trillion.
Over the same period, China’s nominal GDP soared from $1.2 trillion to more than $10 trillion – growing at more than four times the global rate.
In 2000, the BRIC economies’ combined size was about a quarter of US GDP.
Today, they have nearly caught up, with a combined GDP of more than $16 trillion, just short of America’s $17.4 trillion.
Indeed, since 2000, the BRICs have been responsible for nearly a third of the rise in nominal global GDP.
And other emerging countries have performed similarly well.
Nigeria’s economy has grown 11-fold since 2000, and Indonesia’s has more than quintupled.
Since 2008, these two developing giants have contributed more to global GDP growth than the EU has.
Statistics like these utterly disprove the idea that global inequality is growing.
Gaps in income and wealth may be shooting up within individual countries, but per capita income in developing countries is rising much faster than in the advanced economies.
Indeed, that is why one of the key targets of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals – to halve the number of people living in absolute poverty – was achieved five years ahead of the deadline.
None of this is meant to deny that we are living in challenging and uncertain times.
But one thing is clear: economically, at least, the world is continuing to become a better place.
Global Energy Realism
MADRID – Energy has become a focal point of global policymaking.
As falling oil prices grab headlines worldwide, US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signed a major climate-change deal, and October’s European Council decisions could signal real progress toward a serious European Union energy policy.
This momentum should be maintained in the coming year, culminating in December’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris.
But, in order to establish a global energy system that meets growing demand within the constraints of carbon neutrality, we must avoid the pitfalls that have plagued past responses.
In particular, we must strike the proper balance between ideology and realism, the public and private sectors, and long- and short-term considerations.
And, critically, we must follow through on our commitments.
When it comes to ideology and realism, the European Union is perhaps the best example of an imbalanced approach, as Europeans’ tendency to lead with their hearts, rather than their heads, has undermined effective action.
The knee-jerk rejection of nuclear power by some EU member countries has led to sharp increases in coal usage.
Renewables have been pursued with a sort of missionary zeal, regardless of their effectiveness or feasibility.
And the EU’s “20/20/20 targets” – a 20% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, a 20% share for renewables, and a 20% increase in energy efficiency, all by 2020 – was more of a mantra than a policy.
Bridging the gap between the public and private sectors is vital to finance the construction of an efficient global energy system.
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040, the annual investment required in energy-supply infrastructure alone will total $2 trillion, up 20% from current levels.
Over the next 26 years, some $51 trillion will be needed.
This is just part of the overall infrastructure investment shortfall, which stands at $1 trillion annually – far more than what governments can afford.
That is why governments must build innovative partnerships with private-sector actors, while recognizing that energy, as a public good, must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight.
There have been some notable moves in this direction, though it remains to be seen whether they will translate into real action.
China has spearheaded the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
More important, the World Bank, the G-20, and the EU recently launched initiatives aimed at directing the financing power of business toward infrastructure development.
The World Bank’s Global Infrastructure Facility is an open platform that brings together multilateral development banks, national governments, and private finance to shepherd infrastructure projects to completion and to fill in gaps that have hampered investment.
Pivotal to sparking this investment is the mitigation of associated political risks, especially through an enhanced role for the Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.
Similarly, at last month’s summit in Brisbane, the G-20 created a new Global Infrastructure Hub to facilitate information-sharing, thereby streamlining infrastructure projects.
And, the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility has allocated €5.85 billion ($7.2 billion) from now until 2020 to help kick-start private investment in infrastructure projects linking member countries’ energy systems.
Of course, the need for private-sector involvement extends beyond investment.
The private sector is also better situated to research and develop new production methods that limit demand for fossil fuels.
To spur such action, the public sector should offer funds or guarantees, which, though risky, could offer huge benefits.
US government funding of research into hydraulic fracturing – the technology now driving the surge in America’s oil and gas production – dates back to the 1970s.
This brings us to the need to balance short-term imperatives with long-term vision.
Energy projects and policies today must account for the projected increase in emerging-market demand, while ensuring sufficient investment in future generating capacity.
For example, over the next 25 years, 60% of the EU’s generating capacity is due to retire – contributing to demand for $2.2 trillion of energy investment.
Furthermore, with US tight-oil production expected to peak in the early 2020s, new sources must be developed, such as in Iraq.
Given the long lead time for bringing new projects onstream, efforts to address the coming shortfall must begin today.
In all of these efforts, there is one common imperative: matching words with deeds.
The world does not need more commitments and pledges; it needs action.
Yet many countries continue to issue weak declarations that fail to produce genuine progress.
Once again, this problem is particularly pervasive in Europe.
The maxims of today – the need for diverse suppliers, enhanced interconnection, greater efficiency, and a sensible energy mix – have been discussed for at least a decade.
In fact, despite the seemingly unending stream of new energy initiatives and projects, Europe has made little progress; its energy situation may even be worse.
Repackaging the same old strategies – here one need look no further than European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker’s much-hyped €300 billion investment package – simply will not work.
With attention focused on COP21 next December, the coming year will be an exceptional opportunity to build a sound global energy system.
Europe, which has prided itself on its energy leadership, should set an example by developing – and then implementing – a realistic long-term strategy that involves the private sector.
Global Finance and Global Warming
NEW DELHI/LONDON – Since 2008, when the global financial crisis nearly brought down the world economy, financial reform has been among the top items on policymakers’ agendas.
But, as leaders move from fixing the problems of the past to positioning the financial system for the future, they must also grapple with new threats to its stability, particularly those stemming from climate change.
That is why a growing number of governments, regulators, standard-setters, and market actors are starting to incorporate rules concerning sustainability into the financial system.
In Brazil, the central bank views the integration of environmental and social factors into risk management as a way to strengthen resilience.
And in countries like Singapore and South Africa, companies listed on the stock market are obligated to disclose their environmental and social performance, a requirement that investors and regulators increasingly view as essential to the efficient functioning of financial markets.
Initiatives like these might once have been regarded as part of a peripheral “green” niche.
Today, they are considered central to the operation of the financial system.
In Bangladesh, the central bank’s efforts to support economic development include low-cost refinancing for banks lending to projects that meet goals for renewables, energy efficiency, or waste management.
In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England is currently evaluating the implications of climate change for the insurance sector as part of its core mandate to oversee the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
In China, annual investment in green industry could reach $320 billion in the next five years, with the government able to provide only 10-15% of the total.
In order to prevent a funding shortfall, the People’s Bank of China has recently produced a report with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) setting out a comprehensive set of recommendations for establishing China’s “green financial system.”
In India, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry has established a new “green bond” working group to explore how the country’s debt markets can respond to the challenge of financing smart infrastructure.
And recent regulatory changes hold out considerable potential for listed investment trusts to deploy capital for clean energy.
So far, such measures affect only a small fraction of the $305 trillion in assets held by banks, investors, financial institutions, and individuals in the global financial system.
But they are set to be applied more broadly as financiers and regulators alike recognize the full consequences of environmental dislocation.
Those consequences already are severe.
In 116 of 140 countries assessed by UNEP, the stock of natural capital that underpins value creation is in decline.
The human and economic costs of continued high-carbon growth include severe health impacts, growing disruption to infrastructure, and water and food security, as well as increasing market volatility, most notably in developing countries.
This damage will become worse, with risks becoming unmanageable if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced to net zero levels between 2055 and 2070.
As the threat from climate change becomes more evident, financing the response to its impact will become increasingly important.
Developed countries have committed to mobilize $100 billion in annual financial flows to developing countries by 2020, but much more is needed.
Above all, it is essential to place the financing challenge posed by climate change within the broader context of the green economy and sustainable development.
The task for those charged with governing the financial system is to enable the orderly transition from high- to low-carbon investments and from vulnerable to resilient assets.
According to the New Climate Economy initiative, $89 trillion will be spent on global infrastructure investment by 2030 – with an additional $4.1 trillion needed to make it low-carbon and resilient.
To mobilize the required capital, policymakers will need to harness the power of the financial system.
The scope of risk management will need to be expanded, so that long-term sustainability and risks from climate change are included in prudential rules for banking, insurance, and investment.
New “green banks” can help to bring in funding from debt and equity markets.
Transparency will have to be improved, through better corporate reporting and enhanced disclosure from financial institutions.
And financial professionals’ skills and incentives will have to be retooled and revised to reflect these new priorities.
Promising avenues for international cooperation are now opening up.
For example, the G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors have just asked the Financial Stability Board to explore how the financial sector could address climate issues.
Actions such as these will not only strengthen climate security; they will also contribute to a more efficient, effective, and resilient financial system.
Global Finance’s Supply-Chain Revolution
HONG KONG – In March 2011, the catastrophic earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that hit Japan halted production of key components on which many global supply chains depend.
The sudden disruption of these essential materials from the production process forced a reassessment of how these supply chains function.
But such vulnerabilities are not confined to the manufacturing sector.
The finance industry, too, has suffered its own near “supply chain” meltdown in recent times.
The failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 not only roiled global financial markets, but also brought global trade practically to a standstill as wholesale banks refused to fund each other for fear of counterparty failure.
The simple banking system of the past, one based on retail savings being concentrated in order to fund the credit needs of borrowers, had evolved into a highly complex – and global – supply chain with knock-on risks of disruption comparable to those seen in Japan last spring.
Financial supply chains and those in the manufacturing sector share three key features – architecture, feedback mechanisms, and processes – and their robustness and efficiency depend upon how these components interact.
In today’s financial architecture, as with other supply chains, interdependent networks tend to concentrate in powerful hubs.
For example, just two financial centers, London and New York, dominate international finance, and only 22 players conduct 90% of all global foreign-exchange trading.
Such concentration is very efficient, but it also contributes to greater systemic risks, because, if the leading hubs fail, the whole system can collapse.
Open feedback mechanisms ensure a supply chain’s ability to respond to a changing environment, but, in the case of financial supply chains, feedback mechanisms can amplify shocks until the whole system blows up.
The Lehman Brothers collapse triggered just such an explosion, with the financial system saved only by government bailouts.
Finally, the processes within supply chains, and the feedback interactions between them, can make the system greater or smaller than the sum of its parts.
Since a complex network comprises linkages between many sub-networks, individual inefficiencies or weaknesses can have an impact on the viability of the whole.
Like manufacturing supply chains in the wake of the Japanese disruption, financial supply chains face formidable pressures to re-engineer and adapt as the global economic balance shifts towards emerging markets.
As that happens, billions of consumers will enter these countries’ middle classes, new social networks will evolve, and climate change will become a growing factor in global commerce.
In addition, major regulatory reforms will impose new and higher costs on the financial sector.
Banks and other institutions are also under pressure to devise new financial products that can help the real sector to manage more complex risks and enable investment in areas such as green technology and infrastructure for developing economies.
Moreover, global financial stability now depends upon greater cooperation at the international level, with tighter enforcement of rules at the national level.
It is also clear that emerging markets are searching for alternative growth models that are green and sustainable.
Their financial sectors will have to operate very differently from the current model, which is driven by consumption.
In a world in which both consumption and finance must grow more slowly to cope with global resource and environmental constraints, what role can finance play in reducing addictive consumption, funded by unsustainable leverage?
And, given that financial institutions will have to monitor and manage risk in a radically different manner, both for themselves and their customers, what is the role of distribution in a world where consumption, savings, and investment will accelerate in volatility?
Financial “production” is currently a top-down process.
Instruments are designed in such a way that their sales generate more profits for financial engineers than for end users.
But the rise of interactive social networking has made financial innovation more bottom-up.
Millions of bank customers using mobile phones can provide immediate feedback on which products and services they like or dislike.
In the future, client-service and transaction-management systems will receive more input from customers more frequently, so that product design is shaped interactively.
The current strategy in the financial sector drives excessive competition by increasing market share at rivals’ expense, often breaking trust with customers for the sake of short-term gains.
Yet the financial sector has, in previous eras, proven that it can operate as a public good by providing trustworthy, efficient services.
The winning financial supply chains of the future will instill confidence that they offer safe, stable, and efficient services to the most clients.
Innovation in the last century focused on processes, products, and services.
Today, the financial sector needs innovation of a higher order, involving business models, strategy, and management approaches that restore trust in finance.
Just as Steve Jobs of Apple transformed the computer industry through lifestyle products and highly reliable, user-friendly, and “cool” services, financial institutions will have to introduce new value chains that create confidence by adapting to the growing needs of new markets.
Given such profound changes, financial leaders should think about how to orchestrate a new financial supply chain – the “killer app” for our still new century.
2008 Revisited?
NEW YORK – The question I am asked most often nowadays is this: Are we back to 2008 and another global financial crisis and recession?
My answer is a straightforward no, but that the recent episode of global financial market turmoil is likely to be more serious than any period of volatility and risk-off behavior since 2009.
This is because there are now at least seven sources of global tail risk, as opposed to the single factors – the eurozone crisis, the Federal Reserve “taper tantrum,” a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, and a hard economic landing in China – that have fueled volatility in recent years.
First, worries about a hard landing in China and its likely impact on the stock market and the value of the renminbi have returned with a vengeance.
While China is more likely to have a bumpy landing than a hard one, investors’ concerns have yet to be laid to rest, owing to the ongoing growth slowdown and continued capital flight.
Second, emerging markets are in serious trouble.
They face global headwinds (China’s slowdown, the end of the commodity super cycle, the Fed’s exit from zero policy rates).
Many are running macro imbalances, such as twin current account and fiscal deficits, and confront rising inflation and slowing growth.
Most have not implemented structural reforms to boost sagging potential growth.
And currency weakness increases the real value of trillions of dollars of debt built up in the last decade.
Third, the Fed probably erred in exiting its zero-interest-rate policy in December.
Weaker growth, lower inflation (owing to a further decline in oil prices), and tighter financial conditions (via a stronger dollar, a corrected stock market, and wider credit spreads) now threaten US growth and inflation expectations.
Fourth, many simmering geopolitical risks are coming to a boil.
Perhaps the most immediate source of uncertainty is the prospect of a long-term cold war – punctuated by proxy conflicts – between the Middle East’s regional powers, particularly Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran.
Fifth, the decline in oil prices is triggering falls in US and global equities and spikes in credit spreads.
This may now signal weak global demand – rather than rising supply – as growth in China, emerging markets, and the US slows.
Weak oil prices also damage US energy producers, which comprise a large share of the US stock market, and impose credit losses and potential defaults on net energy exporting economies, their sovereigns, state-owned enterprises, and energy firms.
As regulations restrict market makers from providing liquidity and absorbing market volatility, every fundamental shock becomes more severe in terms of risk-asset price corrections.
Sixth, global banks are challenged by lower returns, owing to the new regulations put in place since 2008, the rise of financial technology that threatens to disrupt their already-challenged business models, the growing use of negative policy rates, rising credit losses on bad assets (energy, commodities, emerging markets, fragile European corporate borrowers), and the movement in Europe to “bail in” banks’ creditors, rather than bail them out with now-restricted state aid.
Finally, the European Union and the eurozone could be ground zero of global financial turmoil this year.
European banks are challenged.
The migration crisis could lead to the end of the Schengen Agreement, and (together with other domestic troubles) to the end of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.
Moreover, Britain’s exit from the EU is becoming more likely.
With the Greek government and its creditors once again on a collision course, the risk of Greece’s exit may return.
Populist parties of the right and the left are gaining strength throughout Europe.
Thus, Europe increasingly risks disintegration.
To top it all off, its neighborhood is unsafe, with wars raging not only in the Middle East, but also – despite repeated attempts by the EU to broker peace – in Ukraine, while Russia is becoming more aggressive on Europe’s borders, from the Baltics to the Balkans.
In the past, tail risks were more occasional, growth scares turned out to be just that, and the policy response was strong and effective, thereby keeping risk-off episodes brief and restoring asset prices to their previous highs (if not taking them even higher).
Today, there are seven sources of potential global tail risk, and the global economy is moving from an anemic expansion (positive growth that accelerates) to a slowdown (positive growth that decelerates), which will lead to further reduction in the price of risky assets (equities, commodities, credit) worldwide.
At the same time, the policies that stopped and reversed the doom loop between the real economy and risk assets are running out of steam.
The policy mix is suboptimal, owing to excessive reliance on monetary rather than fiscal policy.
Indeed, monetary policies are becoming increasingly unconventional, reflected in the move by several central banks to negative real policy rates; and such unconventional policies risk doing more harm than good as they hurt the profitability of banks and other financial firms.
Two dismal months for financial markets may give way in March to a relief rally for assets such as global equities, as some key central banks (the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan) ease more, while others (the Fed and the Bank of England) will remain on hold for longer.
But repeated eruptions from some of the seven sources of global tail risk will make the rest of this year – unlike the previous seven – a bad one for risky assets and anemic for global growth.
The Global Financial System’s Weakened Defenses
ZURICH – Eighty-five years ago this month, Credit-Anstalt, by far the largest bank in Austria, collapsed.
By that July, banks in Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey had experienced runs.
A banking panic hit the United States in August, though the sources of that panic may have been domestic.
In September, banks in the United Kingdom experienced large withdrawals.
The parallels to the 2008 collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers are strong – and crucial for understanding today’s financial risks.
For starters, neither the collapse of Credit-Anstalt nor that of Lehman Brothers caused all of the global financial tumult that ensued.
Those collapses and the subsequent problems were symptoms of the same disease: a weak banking system.
In Austria in 1931, the problem was rooted in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, hyperinflation in the early 1920s, and banks’ excessive exposure to the industrial sector.
By the time Credit-Anstalt collapsed, the world had been in deep recession for two years, banking systems in a number of countries had become fragile, and tensions were easily transmitted across national borders, with the gold standard exacerbating financial vulnerability by constraining central banks’ ability to act.
Similarly, in 2008, the entire financial system was overextended, owing to a combination of weak internal risk management and inadequate government regulation and supervision.
Lehman Brothers was simply the weakest link in a long chain of brittle financial firms.
Could a crisis like those triggered by the Credit-Anstalt and the Lehman Brothers collapse happen today?
One is tempted to say no.
After all, the global economy and the financial system appear to be on the mend; risk-taking in the private sector has been reduced; and huge, though burdensome, regulatory improvements have been undertaken.
Taken together, these developments surely make for a stable financial system.
The problem with this reasoning is that financial crises tend to reveal fault lines that were not visible before.
Indeed, the financial sector manages the risks that it recognizes, not necessarily all the risks that it runs.
And it is easy to overestimate the crisis-preventing power of the new regulatory environment, which is analogous to a new highway: It is technically safer than a country road, but it also attracts more cars that are traveling at much higher speeds, so traffic accidents continue.
Unable to rule out a new crisis, how well are we equipped to cope with one?
The short answer is: not very.
In fact, if a financial crisis were to occur today, its consequences for the real economy might be even more severe than in the past.
Of course, because central banks now recognize that their responsibilities extend beyond stabilizing prices to include the prevention and management of financial tensions, they would undoubtedly be quick to respond to any shock with a battery of market operations.
But, in the event of a crisis, the tools available to central banks to prevent deflation and a collapse of the real economy are severely constrained, especially today.
In the early twentieth century, central banks could all devalue their currencies against gold, thereby raising the price level and escaping debt deflation.
And, indeed, nine countries, including the UK, did exactly that in 1931, with another eight countries, including the US, following suit over the next five years.
Today, however, currency depreciation is a zero-sum game.
Without the joint-depreciation option, central banks responded to the 2008 crisis with interest-rate cuts that were unprecedented in scope, size, and speed, as well as massive purchases of long-term securities (so-called quantitative easing, or QE).
And those efforts were effective.
But interest rates remain extremely low, and are even negative in some countries, and QE has been taken close to its limits, with public support for the policy waning.
As a result, these tools’ ability to cushion an economy against further shocks is severely constrained.
While forward guidance by central banks has also helped, it, too, is unlikely to be able to provide an effective buffer against a new shock.
None of this is to say that another global financial crisis is necessarily imminent.
On the contrary, economies worldwide are making progress in recovering from the 2008 disaster, and the US Federal Reserve’s tightening of policy last December signals that the global interest-rate cycle is moving into the next phase.
This is good news.
But the danger of another financial crisis should not be ruled out.
Indeed, given that the capacity of central banks to cope with a financial shock will remain woefully limited for years to come, it should be taken very seriously. The risks of complacency are simply too great.
What Role for Global Governance?
WASHINGTON, DC – Can global governance solve most of our economic problems?
Or does it too often promise more than it can deliver, and divert attention from more practical reforms that national governments should implement?
In a recent commentary, Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik thoughtfully argues the latter.
Is he right?
To be sure, national policy has a more direct effect – good or bad – on a country’s citizens.
But we cannot ignore the global effects of bad national policies, the most obvious examples noted by Rodrik being greenhouse-gas emissions and infectious diseases.
People in the “country of origin” may pay a price, but so will the rest of us.
“Globalization” has been a catchword for decades, and the need for global governance has admittedly been exaggerated in recent years, especially by those on the center left.
This has led to calls for new alternatives, such as “responsible nationalism” or “inter-governmental” – as opposed to supranational – decision-making in the European Union.
Such proposals make for a healthy debate.
For example, we should reevaluate the current system for deciding trade agreements, which have become more about regulatory and investment issues than about eliminating import tariffs or other import barriers.
It is no surprise that even some free-trade supporters object to agreements that allow trade groups to insert language granting multinational corporations undue market power at the expense of consumer protection.
Still, the push for stronger global governance in recent years has not happened in a vacuum.
Countries have undoubtedly become more economically and socially interdependent, owing to trade, travel, and telecommunications, not to mention multinational corporate structures and international financial flows.
Global intercourse is broader, faster, and more ubiquitous than ever before.
Globalization may occasionally hit speed bumps, such as the current slowdown in world trade; but the underlying technological changes driving interconnectivity will only continue to bring people and countries closer together.
Ultimately, this is for the best, because the major challenges we face today are global in nature.
Efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change will require consistent global coordination.
Even local initiatives, which are increasingly important for addressing the problem, must fit into a framework of converging global policies and obligations.
Otherwise, people will not feel as though they are making a difference or contributing to a shared goal, and others will not feel pressure to do anything at all.
Another global challenge is taxation, which requires international coordination to stanch rampant avoidance and evasion.
The problem is not just individual “tax havens”; there is also a need to capture corporate profits that companies’ move internationally with complex devices such as “transfer pricing” and “tax-base shifting” to minimize their tax bill.
Disparate tax rules among different countries have resulted in close to a zero-sum game for national governments, which are forced to pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies to secure a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.
Under the current system, countries have strong incentives to offer ever-greater tax advantages to companies operating within their borders, even though they stand just as strong a chance of being undercut by another country as companies shift their declared profits from one jurisdiction to another.
In most cases, companies are not doing anything illegal by taking advantage of this fragmented system.
But if countries are serious about reducing inequality and funding pensions and health care for their citizens, they will have to cooperate in global-governance efforts to prioritize fair taxation.
Climate change and taxation are just two issues requiring global coordination, but the list goes on.
The monetary policies of large reserve-currency central banks such as the United States Federal Reserve can have far-reaching spillover effects, as can self-destructive exchange-rate policies or regulations on cross-border financial flows.
In most of these cases, the damage runs downstream from large countries to smaller countries; however, if enough small countries are affected, the aggregate damage can flow back to the larger economies themselves, as we’ve seen in the European debt crisis.
Given the scale of these challenges, we have no choice but to cooperate internationally and strengthen global and regional institutions and frameworks such as the International Monetary Fund, the EU, and the G20, which will meet in Hangzhou, China, next month.
But global governance is not an either/or proposition.
When national or local policies are sufficient to address a problem, then they should be pursued.
Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity – whereby decision-making should occur at the most local level possible – is crucial to flexible, functioning global governance.
The presence of global-governance frameworks should never become an excuse for national or local inaction.
Public policy is a multi-level and multi-channel effort with local, national, regional, and global dimensions.
Ideally, policy debates should acknowledge this reality.
We also must acknowledge the urgency of shoring up faith in global governance from another perspective.
Across the US, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, a resurgence of identity politics and xenophobic nationalism threatens to reprise the great tragedies of the twentieth century.
Against this backdrop, stressing the existence and needs of a global community is necessary not only for economic reasons, but also to help ensure a peaceful world.
The False Economic Promise of Global Governance
CAMBRIDGE – Global governance is the mantra of our era’s elite.
The surge in cross-border flows of goods, services, capital, and information produced by technological innovation and market liberalization has made the world’s countries too interconnected, their argument goes, for any country to be able to solve its economic problems on its own.
We need global rules, global agreements, global institutions.
This claim is so widely accepted today that challenging it may seem like arguing that the sun revolves around the earth.
Yet what may be true for truly global problems such as climate change or health pandemics is not true when it comes to most economic issues.
Contrary to what we often hear, the world economy is not a global commons.
Global governance can do only limited good – and it occasionally does some damage.
What makes, say, climate change a problem that requires global cooperation is that the planet has a single climate system.
It makes no difference where greenhouse gases are emitted.
So national restrictions on carbon emissions provide no or little benefit at home.
By contrast, good economic policies – including openness – benefit the domestic economy first and foremost, and the price of bad economic policies is primarily paid domestically as well.
Individual countries’ economic fortunes are determined largely by what happens at home rather than abroad.
If economic openness is desirable, it is because such policies are in a country’s own self-interest – not because it helps others.
Openness and other good policies that contribute to economic stability worldwide rely on self-interest, not on global spirit.
Sometimes domestic economic advantage comes at the expense of other countries.
This is the case of so-called beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
The purest illustration occurs when a dominant supplier of a natural resource, such as oil, restricts supply on world markets to drive up world prices.
The exporter’s gain is the rest of the world’s loss.
A similar mechanism underpins “optimum tariffs,” whereby a large country manipulates its terms of trade by placing restrictions on its imports.
In such instances, there is a clear argument for global rules that limit or prohibit the use of such policies.
But the vast majority of the issues in world trade and finance that preoccupy policymakers are not of this kind.
Consider, for example, Europe’s agricultural subsidies and ban on genetically modified organisms, the abuse of antidumping rules in the United States, or inadequate protection of investors’ rights in developing countries.
These are essentially “beggar thyself” policies.
Their economic costs are borne primarily at home, even though they may produce adverse effects for others as well.
For example, economists generally agree that agricultural subsidies are inefficient and that the benefits to European farmers come at large costs to everyone else in Europe, in the form of high prices, high taxes, or both.
Such policies are deployed not to extract advantages from other countries, but because other competing domestic objectives – distributional, administrative, or related to public health – dominate economy-wide motives.
The same is true of poor banking regulations or macroeconomic policies that aggravate the business cycle and generate financial instability.
As the 2008 global financial crisis showed, the implications beyond a country’s own borders can be momentous.
But if US regulators fell asleep on the job, it was not because their economy benefited while everyone else paid the price.
The US economy was among those that suffered most.
Perhaps the biggest policy letdown of our day is the failure of governments in advanced democracies to address rising inequality.
This, too, has its roots in domestic politics – financial and business elites’ grip on the policymaking process and the narratives they have spun about the limits of redistributive policies.
To be sure, global tax havens are an example of beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
But powerful countries such as the US and European Union members could have done much on their own to limit tax evasion – and the race to the bottom in corporate taxation – if they so desired.
So the problems of our day have little to do with a lack of global cooperation.
They are domestic in nature and cannot be fixed by rule making through international institutions, which are easily overwhelmed by the same vested interests that undermine domestic policy.
Too often, global governance is another name for the pursuit of these interests’ global agenda, which is why it ends up mainly furthering globalization and harmonizing domestic economic policies.
An alternative agenda for global governance would focus on improving how democracies function at home, without prejudging what the policy outputs ought to be.
This would be a democracy-enhancing rather than globalization-enhancing model of global governance.
What I have in mind is the creation of global norms and procedural requirements designed to enhance the quality of domestic policymaking.
Global disciplines pertaining to transparency, broad representation, accountability, and use of scientific or economic evidence in domestic proceedings – without constraining the end result – are examples of such requirements.
Global institutions already use disciplines of this type to some extent.
For example, the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) explicitly requires the use of scientific evidence when health concerns are at issue for imported goods.
Procedural rules of this kind can be used much more extensively and to greater effect to improve domestic decision-making.
Anti-dumping rules can also be improved by requiring that consumer and producer interests that would be adversely affected by import duties take part in domestic proceedings.
Subsidy rules can be improved by requiring economic cost-benefit analyses that incorporate potential consequences for both static and dynamic efficiency.
Problems rooted in failures of domestic deliberation can be solved only through improved democratic decision-making.
Global governance can make only a very limited contribution here – and only if it focuses on enhancing domestic decision-making rather than constraining it.
Otherwise, the goal of global governance embodies a yearning for technocratic solutions that override and undercut public deliberation.
The Global Growth Funk
NEW YORK – The International Monetary Fund and others have recently revised downward their forecasts for global growth – yet again.
Little wonder: The world economy has few bright spots – and many that are dimming rapidly.
Among advanced economies, the United States has just experienced two quarters of growth averaging 1%.
Further monetary easing has boosted a cyclical recovery in the eurozone, though potential growth in most countries remains well below 1%.
In Japan, “Abenomics” is running out of steam, with the economy slowing since mid-2015 and now close to recession.
In the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding the June referendum on continued European Union membership is leading firms to keep hiring and capital spending on hold.
And other advanced economies – such as Canada, Australia, Norway – face headwinds from low commodity prices.
Things are not much better in most emerging economies.
Among the five BRICS countries, two (Brazil and Russia) are in recession, one (South Africa) is barely growing, another (China) is experiencing a sharp structural slowdown, and India is doing well only because – in the words of its central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan – in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Many other emerging markets have slowed since 2013 as well, owing to weak external conditions, economic fragility (stemming from loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies in the good years), and, often, a move away from market-oriented reforms and toward variants of state capitalism.
Worse, potential growth has also fallen in both advanced and emerging economies.
For starters, high levels of private and public debt are constraining spending – especially growth-enhancing capital spending, which fell (as a share of GDP) after the global financial crisis and has not recovered to pre-crisis levels.
That falloff in investment implies slower productivity growth, while aging populations in developed countries – and now in an increasing number of emerging markets (for example, China, Russia, and Korea) – reduce the labor input in production.
The rise in income and wealth inequality exacerbates the global saving glut (which is the counterpart of the global investment slump).
As income is redistributed from labor to capital, it flows from those who have a higher marginal propensity to spend (low- and middle-income households) to those who have a higher marginal propensity to save (high-income households and corporations).
Moreover, a protracted cyclical slump can lead to lower trend growth.
Economists call this “hysteresis”: Long-term unemployment erodes workers’ skills and human capital; and, because innovation is embedded in new capital goods, low investment leads to permanently lower productivity growth.
Finally, with so many factors dragging down potential growth, structural reforms are needed to boost potential growth.
But such reforms are occurring at suboptimal rates in both advanced and emerging economies, because all of the costs and dislocations are frontloaded, while the benefits occur over the medium and long term.
This gives opponents of reform a political advantage.
Meanwhile, actual growth remains below the diminished potential.
A painful deleveraging process implies that private and public spending need to fall, and that savings must rise, to reduce high deficits and debts.
This process started in the US after the housing bust, then spread to Europe, and is now ongoing in emerging markets that spent the last decade on a borrowing binge.
At the same time, the policy mix has not been ideal.
With most advanced economies pivoting too quickly to fiscal retrenchment, the burden of reviving growth was placed almost entirely on unconventional monetary policies, which have diminishing returns (if not counter-productive effects).
Asymmetric adjustment between debtor and creditor economies has also undermined growth.
The former, having overspent and under-saved, had to spend less and save more when markets forced them to do so, whereas the latter were not forced to spend more and save less.
This exacerbated the global savings glut and global investment slump.
Finally, hysteresis further weakened actual growth.
A cyclical slump reduced potential growth, and the reduction in potential growth prospects led to further cyclical weakness, as spending declines when expectations are revised downward.
There are no politically easy solutions to the global economy’s current quandary.
Unsustainably high debt should be reduced in a rapid and orderly fashion, to avoid a long and protracted (often a decade or longer) deleveraging process.
But orderly debt-reduction mechanisms are not available for sovereign countries and are politically difficult to implement within countries for households, firms, and financial institutions.
Likewise, structural and market-oriented reforms are necessary to boost potential growth.
But, given the timing of costs and benefits, such measures are especially unpopular if an economy is already in a slump.
It will be no less difficult to leave behind unconventional monetary policies, as the US Federal Reserve recently suggested by signaling that it will normalize policy interest rates more slowly than expected.
Meanwhile, fiscal policy – especially productive public investment that boosts both the demand and supply sides – remains hostage to high debts and misguided austerity, even in countries with the financial capacity to undertake a slower consolidation.
Thus, for the time being, we are likely to remain in what the IMF calls the “new mediocre,” Larry Summers calls “secular stagnation,” and the Chinese call the “new normal.”
But make no mistake: There is nothing normal or healthy about economic performance that is increasing inequality and, in many countries, leading to a populist backlash – both on the right and the left – against trade, globalization, migration, technological innovation, and market-oriented policies.
Global Imbalances without Tears
CAMBRIDGE – Doctors have long known that it is not just how much you eat, but what you eat, that contributes to or diminishes your health.
Likewise, economists have long noted that for countries gorging on capital inflows, there is a big difference between debt instruments and equity-like investments, including both stocks and foreign direct investment.
So, with policymakers and pundits railing against sustained oversized trade imbalances, we need to recognize that the real problems are rooted in excessive concentrations of debt.
If G-20 governments stood back and asked themselves how to channel a much larger share of the imbalances into equity-like instruments, the global financial system that emerged just might be a lot more robust than the crisis-prone system that we have now.
Unfortunately, we are very far from the idealized world in which financial markets efficiently share risk.
Of the roughly $200 trillion in global financial assets today, almost three-quarters are in some kind of debt instrument, including bank loans, corporate bonds, and government securities.
The derivatives market certainly helps spread risk more widely than this superficial calculation implies, but the basic point stands.
Certainly, there are some good economic reasons why lenders have such an insatiable appetite for debt.
Imperfect information and difficulties in monitoring firms pose significant obstacles to idealized risk-sharing instruments.
But policy-induced distortions also play an enormous role.
Many countries’ tax systems hugely favor debt over equity.
The housing boom in the United States might never have reached the proportions that it did if homeowners had been unable to treat interest payments on home loans as a tax deduction.
Corporations are allowed to deduct interest payments on bonds, but stock dividends are effectively taxed at the both the corporate and the individual level.
Central banks and finance ministries are also complicit, since debt gets bailed out far more aggressively than equity does.
But, contrary to populist rhetoric, it is not just rich, well-connected bondholders who get bailed out. Many small savers place their savings in so-called money-market funds that pay a premium over ordinary federally insured deposits.
Shouldn’t they expect to face risk?
Yet a critical moment in the crisis came when, shortly after the mid-September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, a money-market fund “broke the buck” and couldn’t pay 100 cents on the dollar. Of course, it was bailed out along with all the other money-market funds.
I am not advocating a return to the early Middle Ages, when Church usury laws forbade interest on loans.
Back then, financial-market participants had to devise fantastic schemes and contortions to disguise interest payments.
Yet today the pendulum has arguably swung too far in the opposite direction.
Perhaps scholars who argue that Islamic financial systems’ prohibition on interest generates massive inefficiencies ought to be looking at these systems for positive ideas that Western policymakers might adopt.
Unfortunately, overcoming the deeply ingrained debt bias in rich-world financial systems will not be easy.
In the US, for example, no politician is anxious to say that home-mortgage deductions should be eliminated, or that dividend payments should be tax-free.
Likewise, developing countries should accelerate the pace of economic reform, and equity markets in too many emerging economies are like the Wild West, with unclear rules and lax enforcement.
Worse still, even as the G-20 talks about finding a “fix” for global imbalances, some of the policy changes that its members have adopted are arguably exacerbating them.
For example, we now have a super-size International Monetary Fund, whose lending capacity has been tripled, to roughly $750 billion.
Europe has similarly expanded its regional bailout facility.
These funds may prove to be an effective short-term salve, but, over the long run, they will likely fuel moral-hazard problems, and potentially plant the seeds of deeper crises in the future.
A better approach would be to create a mechanism for orchestrating orderly sovereign default, both to minimize damage when crises do occur, and to discourage lenders from assuming that taxpayers’ money will solve all major problems.
The IMF proposed exactly such a mechanism in 2001, and a similar idea has been discussed more recently for the eurozone.
Unfortunately, however, ideas for debt-restructuring mechanisms remain just that: purely theoretical constructs.
In the meantime, the IMF and the G-20 can help by finding better ways to assess the vulnerability of each country’s financial structure – no easy task, given governments’ immense cleverness when it comes to cooking their books.
Policymakers can also help find ways to reduce barriers to the development of stock markets, and to advance ideas for new kinds of state-contingent bonds, such as the GDP-linked bonds that Yale’s Robert Shiller has proposed. (Shiller bonds, in theory, pay more when a country’s economy is growing and less when it is in recession.)
Of course, even if the composition of international capital flows can be changed, there are still many good reasons to try to reduce global imbalances.
An asset diet rich in equities and direct investment and low in debt cannot substitute for other elements of fiscal and financial health.
But our current unwholesome asset diet is an important component of risk, one that has received far too little attention in the policy debate.
The State of Global Poverty
WASHINGTON, DC – The economic geography of the world is changing.
The eurozone faces the specter of another round of stagnation; Japan has slipped into recession; and the United States, despite relatively strong performance in the latter part of 2014, has raised concerns worldwide with its exit from quantitative easing.
Meanwhile, emerging economies have continued to perform well.
India and Indonesia are growing at more than 5% per year; Malaysia at 6%; and China by more than 7%.
The scale of the global change can be seen when purchasing power parity (PPP) – a measure of the total amount of goods and services that a dollar can buy in each country – is taken into account.
According to the figures for 2011, released last year, India is now the world’s third largest economy in terms of PPP-adjusted GDP, ahead of Germany and Japan.
The data also revealed that China would overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in PPP terms sometime in 2014 – a shift that, according to our estimates, occurred on October 10th.
Despite this progress, a large proportion of people in developing countries remain desperately poor.
Globally, the poverty line is defined as a daily income of $1.25, adjusted for PPP – a line that many criticize as shockingly low.
But what is truly shocking is that nearly one billion people – including more than 80% of the populations of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Liberia, and Burundi – live below it.
One reason global poverty has been so intractable is that it remains largely out of sight for those who are not living it, safely somebody else’s problem.
The fact that most participants in discussions about global poverty – the readers of this commentary included – know few, if any, people who live below the poverty line is an indication of the extent of the world’s economic segregation.
If poverty were communicable, its incidence would be far lower by now.
Fortunately, a chorus of voices, not just from civil-society groups, but also from international organizations, has given rise to a global movement to end poverty.
There is now a growing consensus that global poverty is not just a problem of the poor.
Though moral outrage is important, it is not enough when it comes to crafting policy.
Policymakers need data and, equally important, the ability to analyze it.
The first task is to distinguish between what is feasible and what is not.
For example, some have proposed including the provision of employment for all adults in the Millennium Development Goals’ successor framework, which is to be unveiled this year.
This is an impossible target.
All economies of any reasonable size will have some unemployment.
In fact, a limited amount of unemployment can help to promote development.
To declare “employment” a right is to divest the word “right” of its meaning.
Next, there must be recognition that economies are complex and interconnected.
Consider, for example, a government policy in which subsidies, funded with newly printed money, are handed out to residents of 1,000 villages.
This will not necessarily be a boon for the economy as a whole.
Injecting money might improve the living standards in the villages receiving the funds, but doing so may well drive up the cost of food throughout the country, causing residents of non-subsidized villages to fall into poverty.
The macroeconomic impact of micro-interventions is an important reason why poverty has persisted, despite well-meaning interventions to combat it.
Another reason poverty endures is persistent – and, in many places, widening – inequality.
The current level of global inequality is unconscionable.
In 2013, the World Bank, where I am Chief Economist, helped bring the term “shared prosperity” into everyday discourse by declaring, for the first time, that every society should make progress toward this goal its mission.
To be sure, there will always be a certain amount of inequality in the world; in fact, as with unemployment, a limited amount is desirable as a driver of competition and growth.
But the deep and pervasive inequality that exists today can only be condemned.
According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations, the wealth of the world’s 50 richest people totals $1.5 trillion, equivalent to 175% of Indonesia’s GDP, or a little more than Japan’s foreign-exchange reserves.
If one assumes that this wealth yields 8% per year, the annual income of the world’s 50 wealthiest people is close to the total income of the poorest one billion – in other words, those living below the poverty line.
This is a collective failure.
As 2015 begins, we must consider policies and interventions to curb such extreme inequality.
We must do this not only out of a sense of justice, but also because, in a world afflicted with such extreme disparities, its poorest residents lose their voice, even when they have the right to vote.
Extreme inequality is, ultimately, an assault on democracy.
Who Should Lead International Institutions?
OXFORD – The United Nations is seeking a new secretary-general. The World Bank presidency is up for grabs.
The same goes for several other international organizations. At a time when conflicts of interest among the United States and its allies, together with the rise of China and Russia, are undermining global cooperation, the question of who fills these vacancies could not be more important.
In the past, the process of selecting the right candidate has reflected rivalries among countries and popularity contests played out among governments, NGOs, and the media.
This was clearly never the best approach. But, with a hegemonic United States willing and able to hold international institutions together, cooperation remained viable.
Today, the unpredictable statements of US presidential candidate Donald Trump and the more isolationist vision that he is encouraging among his supporters has the rest of the world nervous about the changing nature of America’s role in the world.
And America’s allies in Europe are not exactly at their most stable, owing to a combination of deep-rooted economic challenges, the United Kingdom’s looming exit from the European Union, and surging support for populist political forces in many countries.
Moreover, the US and its allies are not only unwilling to underpin global cooperation, they lack the capacity even to try.
The International Monetary Fund’s recent World Economic Outlook reports that the US and its allies will account for just 39% of global output in 2020, down sharply from 64% today, with the US share falling from 22% to 15%.
For the international institutions, this means that communication, compromise, and consensus are more important than ever – and not just among countries.
Given strong anti-establishment and even nationalist sentiment in many countries, international institutions must also be more open with – and responsive to – the global public that they are supposed to serve.
All of this demands a more meritocratic and unbiased approach to filling the top positions at the international institutions.
To assess the candidates fairly and effectively, five key criteria should be used.
First, candidates should have a proven ability not just to define a mission, but also to take on the more challenging task of mobilizing a broad coalition of stakeholders to achieve it.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for example, had little trouble identifying critical issues, from specific humanitarian crises in countries like Haiti, Myanmar, and Pakistan to broader challenges like climate change and global poverty. But his success in spurring countries to work together to address those issues is dubious.
Second, leaders must be able to persuade countries to fund their organizations.
Former African Development Bank President Donald P. Kaberuka convinced countries to double their contributions during his tenure; during the same cycle, the World Bank’s resources were increased by just one-third.
But it is not just a matter of getting more money.
Organizations need to focus on expanding their core resources, which are not tied to any specific task, rather than drawing more discretionary or earmarked resources.
Otherwise, they risk becoming hired hands for a few pet projects, rather than critical platforms for broad cooperation.
Unfortunately, in recent years, discretionary funding has largely taken over, and now accounts for more than 90% of resources in several agencies.
The International Organization for Migration, the importance of which has been underscored by the ongoing refugee crisis, relies entirely on discretionary funding.
To change this, international organizations need leaders who are convincing salespeople, which means that they must be widely perceived as genuine and trustworthy.
The third criterion for effective leadership of an international institution is strong, results-oriented management.
Successful candidates should already have experience leading an organization that performed well, achieving the results they set out to achieve.
There should be evidence that the candidate can translate a vision into a plan, with clear benchmarks against which progress can be measured.
The current slates of candidates is wanting in this regard.
This can have far-reaching consequences.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has faced substantial criticism for his handling of his flagship initiative: an internal restructuring.
That process has dragged on for four years, and many staff members claim that it is undermining the efficiency of lending operations.
While it is difficult to assess these claims reliably, a leaked internal survey of the organization’s employees indicates, at the very least, that the management culture needs improvement.
This is closely related to the fourth criterion: hiring (and retaining) the right staff.
No leader can do everything alone, so choosing a high-quality team is crucial.
If those working at the organization are unhappy, recruiting the most talented and motivated people will be nearly impossible.
Beyond creating an open, challenging, and supportive culture – reflected in internal surveys that are shared publicly (not leaked) – the leaders of international organizations must resist pressure from member countries to hire particular senior officials, who are not necessarily the highest-performing candidates.
Moreover, they must be willing and able to identify and remove inherited senior managers who are not up to standard.
The key words must be meritocracy and morale.
The final criterion for effective leadership of an international organization concerns accountability.
In the last couple of decades, heads of the IMF, the World Bank, and the UNHCR Refugee Agency have left office under a cloud of suspicion.
Some leaders have lately established far stricter codes of conduct; it is up to the new ones to ensure that they are being enforced.
Welcoming independent evaluation – and disclosing the results – is essential.
And strong institutions need outstanding leaders who can build consensus among increasingly bad-tempered governments, while attracting sufficient resources and mobilizing talented people to get the job done. This is no time to compromise for short-term political expediency.
Globalization After the Crisis
WASHINGTON, DC – The world economy has just been through a severe recession marked by financial turmoil, large-scale destruction of wealth, and declines in industrial production and global trade. According to the International Labor Organization, continued labor-market deterioration in 2009 may lead to an estimated increase in global unemployment of 39-61 million workers relative to 2007.
Meanwhile, global growth in real wages, which slowed dramatically in 2008, is expected to have dropped even further in 2009, despite signs of a possible economic recovery.
In a sample of 53 countries for which data are available, median growth in real average wages had declined from 4.3% in 2007 to 1.4% in 2008.
The World Bank warns that 89 million more people may be trapped in poverty in the wake of the crisis, adding to the 1.4 billion people estimated in 2005 to be living below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day.
In this climate, globalization has come under heavy criticism, including from leaders of developing countries that could strongly benefit from it.
President Yoweri Museveni, who is widely credited for integrating Uganda into world markets, has said that globalization is “the same old order with new means of control, new means of oppression, new means of marginalization” by rich countries seeking to secure access to developing country markets.
Yet the alternative to global integration holds little attraction.
Indeed, while closing an economy may insulate it from shocks, it can also result in stagnation and even severe homegrown crises. Current examples include Myanmar and North Korea; before their economic liberalization China, Vietnam, and India were in the same boat.
To ensure a durable exit from the crisis, and to build foundations for sustained and broad-based growth in a globalized world, developing countries in 2010 and beyond must draw the right lessons from history.
In the current crisis, China, India, and certain other emerging-market countries are coping fairly well.
These countries all had strong external balance sheets and ample room for fiscal maneuver before the crisis, which allowed them to apply countercyclical policies to combat external shocks.
They have also nurtured industries in line with their comparative advantage, which has helped them weather the storm.
Indeed, comparative advantage – determined by the relative abundance of labor, natural resources, and capital endowments – is the foundation for competitiveness, which in turn underpins dynamic growth and strong fiscal and external positions.
By contrast, if a country attempts to defy its comparative advantage, such as by adopting an import-substitution strategy to pursue the development of capital-intensive or high-tech industries in a capital-scarce economy, the government may resort to distortional subsidies and protections that dampen economic performance.
In turn, this risks weakening both the government’s fiscal position and the economy’s external account.
Without the ability to take timely countercyclical measures, such countries fare poorly when crises hit.
To pursue its comparative advantage and prosper in a globalized world, a country needs a price system that reflects the relative abundance of its factor endowments.
Firms in such a context will have incentives to enter industries that can use their relatively abundant labor to replace relatively scarce capital, or vice versa, thereby reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness.
Examples include the development of garments in Bangladesh, software outsourcing in India, and light manufacturing in China.
But such a relative price system is feasible only in a market economy.
This is why China – which appears to be faring well in the crisis, meeting its 8% growth target in 2009 – became an economic powerhouse only after instituting market-oriented reforms in the 1980s.
Indeed, all 13 economies with an average annual growth rate of 7% or more for 25 years or longer, identified in the
Pursuing its comparative advantage strengthens a country’s resilience to crisis and allows for the rapid accumulation of human and physical capital.
Developing countries with such characteristics are able to turn factor endowments from relatively labor- or resource- abundant to relatively capital-abundant in the span of a generation.
In today’s competitive global marketplace, countries need to upgrade and diversify their industries continuously according to their changing endowments.
A pioneering firm’s success or failure in upgrading and/or diversifying will influence whether other firms follow or not.
Government compensation for such pioneering firms can speed the process.
Industrial progress also requires coordination of related investments among firms.
In Ecuador, a country that is now a successful exporter of cut flowers, farmers would not grow flowers decades ago because there was no modern cooling facility near the airport, and private firms would not invest in such facilities without a supply of flowers for export.
In such chicken-and-egg situations, in which the market alone fails to overcome externalities and essential investments go lacking, the government can play a vital facilitating role.
This may be one of the reasons why the
The world is now so far down the path of integration that turning back is no longer a viable option.
We must internalize lessons from the past and focus on establishing well-functioning markets that enable developing countries fully to tap their economies’ comparative advantage.
As part of this process, a facilitating role for the state is desirable in developing and developed economies alike, although the appropriate role may be different depending on a country’s stage of development.
Ultimately, in today’s complex and interlinked world, even the most competitive economies need a helping hand as they climb the global ladder.
Globalization and Anti-Americanism
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world.
American Democrats say that President Bush's policies have squandered America's attractiveness. Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization.
Anti-Americanism, they say, will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat.
I believe that such views lack historical perspective.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world.
Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution, which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits (such as television viewing or Internet use) that are attributed to Americanization, correlation is not causation.
To see why, imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist.
You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization.
Of course, because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways.
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness.
During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
It sent young people to the West for education.
Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science, technology, and industry.
In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions, but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor.
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete, but that after a century and a half of globalization, it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
More fundamentally, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture.
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality.
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it, those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization, betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact.
Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time?
To find any of them one has to travel to the small, primitive, magico-religious communities made up of people… who due to their primitive condition, become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US.
For example, many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Globalization is also a two-edged sword.
In some areas, there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports, but an effort to change American culture itself.
Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism.
More subtly, America's openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture.
Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing, there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese.
But on the contrary, the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets, including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese.
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities.
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago.
Britain, Belgium, and Spain, among others in Europe, have devolved more power to local regions.
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands, but an underlying cultural diversity will remain.
American culture is now prominent, and it contributes to America's attractiveness - its "soft power" - in many, but not all, areas.
At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US.
As globalization spreads technical capabilities, and information technology allows broader participation in global communications, American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish.
A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization, fewer complaints about American arrogance, and less intensity in the anti-American backlash.
The US may have less control in the future, but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy, free markets, individual liberties, and human rights.
The Cacophony of the World
PARIS – In his masterpiece Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger describes, probably too idyllically, the international balance-of-power system that, following the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, produced what came to be called the “Concert of Europe.”
As Kissinger describes it, after the Napoleonic Wars, “There was not only a physical equilibrium, but a moral one.
Power and justice were in substantial harmony.”
Of course, the concert ended in cacophony with the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914.
Today, after the brutality of the first half of the twentieth century, the temporary bipolarity of the Cold War, and America’s brief post-1989 hyperpower status, the world is once again searching for a new international order.
Can something like the Concert of Europe be globalized?
Unfortunately, global cacophony seems more probable.
One obvious reason is the absence of a recognized and accepted international referee.
The United States, which best embodies ultimate power, is less willing – and less able – to exercise it.
And the United Nations, which best embodies the principles of international order, is as divided and impotent as ever.
But, beyond the absence of a referee, another issue looms: the wave of globalization that followed the end of the Cold War has, paradoxically, accelerated fragmentation, affecting democratic and non-democratic countries alike.
From the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia’s violent self-destruction, and Czechoslovakia’s peaceful divorce to today’s centrifugal pressures in Europe, the West, and the major emerging countries, fragmentation has been fundamental to international relations in recent decades.
The information revolution has created a more global, interdependent, and transparent world than ever.
But this has led, in turn, to an anxious, balkanizing quest for identity.
This effort to recover uniqueness is largely the cause of the international system’s growing fragmentation.
In the Concert of Europe, the number of actors was limited, and they were mostly states, whether national or imperial.
Essential values were widely shared, and most actors favored protecting the existing order.
In today’s world, by contrast, the nature of the actors involved is no longer so clear.
Transnational forces, states, and non-state actors are all involved, and their goals are complex and sometimes contradictory, with no universal commitment to preserving the status quo.
The US may be intent on creating a transatlantic trade-and-investment pact with Europe, which would make a political statement to the world that the West writ large constitutes the universal normative reference point.
But does such a West exist?
In our era of fragmentation, there is a more powerful and dynamic American West, a globally more problematic European West (itself fragmented between a prosperous north and an economically lagging south), and even a British West and, in Japan, an Asian West.
The concept of the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) may have been an astute branding tool.
But, aside from its members’ high growth rates, has it had any real significance?
Indeed, China is clearly in a category of its own, as a source of perceived (or real) risk to its regional environment.
If the BRICs’ growth slows (as has begun to happen), the concept’s artificiality will become widely apparent.
What unites emerging powers today is more their denial of international responsibilities than their joint diplomatic efforts.
Fragmentation also affects societies internally.
Deep partisan divisions – whether over the role of government or social/cultural issues – are leading to near-paralysis in democratic societies like the US.
In non-democratic societies, they can lead to revolution and violent power struggles.
This has been the case in much of the Arab world since late 2010.
Even power itself is more fragmented than ever.
Indeed, Moises Naim proclaims its demise in his latest book, The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being in Charge Isn’t What It Used To Be.
While Naim’s conclusion may be premature, he is right about one thing: “Power no longer buys as much as it did in the past.”
It is “easier to get, harder to use – and easier to lose.”
Some analysts maintain, reassuringly, that rapprochement between Asia and the West is possible, given symbiosis between Western democracy and authoritarian Confucianism.
This is Kishore Mahbubani’s argument in his book The Great Convergence.
But the harmony stemming from the encounter between different cultures and systems is nowhere near –&#160;and will not be as long as the rule of law has not taken hold in the emerging world and a culture of modesty has not made headway within the plural West.
The cacophony of the world has replaced the concert of Europe.
And this may very well be the case for the foreseeable future.
Global Solutions for Globalization’s Problems
OXFORD – The last few decades of globalization and innovation have resulted in the most rapid progress that the world has ever known.
Poverty has been reduced.
Life expectancy has increased.
Wealth has been created at a scale that our ancestors could not have imagined.
But the news is not all good.
In fact, the achievements brought about by globalization are now under threat.
The world has simultaneously benefited from globalization and failed to manage the inherent complications resulting from the increased integration of our societies, our economies, and the infrastructure of modern life.
As a result, we have become dangerously exposed to systemic risks that transcend borders.
These threats spill across national boundaries and cross the traditional divides between industries and organizations.
An integrated financial system propagates economic crises.
International air travel spreads pandemics.
Interconnected computers provide rich hunting grounds for cybercriminals.
Middle Eastern jihadis use the Internet to recruit young Europeans.
Living standards rise – and greenhouse-gas emissions follow, accelerating climate change.
As a byproduct of globalization, crises that once burned locally and then quickly flamed out now risk sparking international conflagrations.
A pandemic, flood, or cyber attack in the City of London or Wall Street could send the entire world into a financial tailspin.
If the progress that globalization has delivered is to be sustained, countries must accept shared responsibility for managing the risks that it has engendered.
National governments – whether powerful, like the United States and China, or weak, like Iraq and Liberia – are unable to address these cascading and complex challenges on their own.
Only a small fraction of the risks arising from globalization require a truly global response.
But, by definition, these risks transcend the nation-state; thus, coordinated action is required to address them effectively.
The nature of the response needs to be tailored to the threat.
In the case of pandemics, the key is to support countries where outbreaks occur and help those most at risk of infection.
Widespread dangers, such as climate change or a new financial crisis, can require the cooperation of dozens of countries and a broad range of institutions.
In nearly every case, an international effort is needed.
An important characteristic of the risks of a globalized world is that they often become more serious over time.
As a result, the speed at which they are identified, along with the effectiveness of the response, can determine whether an isolated event becomes a global threat.
One need only look at the rise of the Islamic State, the outbreak of Ebola, the fight against climate change, or the financial contagion of 2008 to see what happens when a danger remains unidentified for too long or a coordinated response is missing or mismanaged.
And yet, just as the need for robust regional and international institutions is at its greatest, support for them is waning.
A growing number of citizens in Europe, North America, and the Middle East blame globalization for unemployment, rising inequality, pandemics, and terrorism.
Because of these risks, they regard increased integration, openness, and innovation as more of a threat than an opportunity.
This creates a vicious circle.
The concerns of the electorate are reflected in rapidly growing support for political parties that advocate increased protectionism, reductions in immigration, and greater national control over the marketplace.
As a result, governments across Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania are becoming more parochial in their concerns, starving international agencies and regional organizations of the funding, credibility, and leadership capabilities needed to mount a proper response to the challenges of globalization.
In the short term, countries may be able to duck their global responsibilities, but the threat posed by events beyond their borders cannot be kept at bay forever.
Unaddressed, the endemic dangers of a globalized world will continue to grow.
In confronting dangers such as the Islamic State, Ebola, financial crisis, climate change, or rising inequality, short-term political expediency must be overcome – or the entire world will come to regret it.
When Globalization Goes Digital
WASHINGTON, DC – American voters are angry.
But while the ill effects of globalization top their list of grievances, nobody is well served when complex economic issues are reduced to bumper-sticker slogans – as they have been thus far in the presidential campaign.
It is unfair to dismiss concerns about globalization as unfounded.
America deserves to have an honest debate about its effects.
In order to yield constructive solutions, however, all sides will need to concede some inconvenient truths – and to recognize that globalization is not the same phenomenon it was 20 years ago.
Protectionists fail to see how the United States’ eroding industrial base is compatible with the principle that globalization boosts growth.
But the evidence supporting that principle is too substantial to ignore.
Recent research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) echoes the findings of other academics: global flows of goods, foreign direct investment, and data have increased global GDP by roughly 10% compared to what it would have been had those flows never occurred.
The extra value provided by globalization amounted to $7.8 trillion in 2014 alone.
And yet, the shuttered factories dotting America’s Midwestern “Rust Belt” are real.
Even as globalization generates aggregate growth, it produces winners and losers.
Exposing local industries to international competition spurs efficiency and innovation, but the resulting creative destruction exacts a substantial toll on families and communities.
Economists and policymakers alike are guilty of glossing over these distributional consequences.
Countries that engage in free trade will find new channels for growth in the long run, the thinking goes, and workers who lose their jobs in one industry will find employment in another.
In the real world, however, this process is messy and protracted.
Workers in a shrinking industry may need entirely new skills to find jobs in other sectors, and they may have to pack up their families and pull up deep roots to pursue these opportunities.
It has taken a popular backlash against free trade for policymakers and the media to acknowledge the extent of this disruption.
That backlash should not have come as a surprise.
Traditional labor-market policies and training systems have not been equal to the task of dealing with the large-scale changes caused by the twin forces of globalization and automation.
The US needs concrete proposals for supporting workers caught up in structural transitions – and a willingness to consider fresh approaches, such as wage insurance.
Contrary to campaign rhetoric, simple protectionism would harm consumers.
A recent study by the US President’s Council of Economic Advisers found that middle-class Americans gain more than a quarter of their purchasing power from trade.
In any event, imposing tariffs on foreign goods will not bring back lost manufacturing jobs.
It is time to change the parameters of the debate and recognize that globalization has become an entirely different animal: The global goods trade has flattened for a variety of reasons, including plummeting commodity prices, sluggishness in many major economies, and a trend toward producing goods closer to the point of consumption.
Cross-border flows of data, by contrast, have grown by a factor of 45 during the past decade, and now generate a greater economic impact than flows of traditional manufactured goods.
Digitization is changing everything: the nature of the goods changing hands, the universe of potential suppliers and customers, the method of delivery, and the capital and scale required to operate globally.
It also means that globalization is no longer exclusively the domain of Fortune 500 firms.
Companies interacting with their foreign operations, suppliers, and customers account for a large and growing share of global Internet traffic.
Already half of the world’s traded services are digitized, and 12% of the global goods trade is conducted via international e-commerce.
E-commerce marketplaces such as Alibaba, Amazon, and eBay are turning millions of small enterprises into exporters.
This remains an enormous untapped opportunity for the US, where fewer than 1% of companies export – a far lower share than in any other advanced economy.
Despite all the anti-trade rhetoric, it is crucial that Americans bear in mind that most of the world’s customers are overseas.
Fast-growing emerging economies will be the biggest sources of consumption growth in the years ahead.
This would be the worst possible moment to erect barriers.
The new digital landscape is still taking shape, and countries have an opportunity to redefine their comparative advantages.
The US may have lost out as the world chased low labor costs; but it operates from a position of strength in a world defined by digital globalization.
There is real value in the seamless movement of innovation, information, goods, services, and – yes – people.
As the US struggles to jump-start its economy, it cannot afford to seal itself off from an important source of growth.
US policymakers must take a nuanced, clear-eyed view of globalization, one that addresses its downsides more effectively, not only when it comes to lost jobs at home, but also when it comes to its trading partners’ labor and environmental standards.
Above all, the US needs to stop retrying the past – and start focusing on how it can compete in the next era of globalization.
Rethinking Robin Hood
MADRID – International development aid is based on the Robin Hood principle: take from the rich and give to the poor.
National development agencies, multilateral organizations, and NGOs currently transfer more than $135 billion a year from rich countries to poor countries with this idea in mind.
A more formal term for the Robin Hood principle is “cosmopolitan prioritarianism,” an ethical rule that says we should think of everyone in the world in the same way, no matter where they live, and then focus help where it helps the most.
Those who have less have priority over those who have more.
This philosophy implicitly or explicitly guides the aid for economic development, aid for health, and aid for humanitarian emergencies.
On its face, cosmopolitan prioritarianism makes sense.
People in poor countries have needs that are more pressing, and price levels are much lower in poor countries, so that a dollar or euro goes twice or three times further than it does at home.
Spending at home is not only more expensive, but it also goes to those who are already well off (at least relatively, judged by global standards), and so does less good.
I have thought about and tried to measure global poverty for many years, and this guide has always seemed broadly right.
But I currently find myself feeling increasingly unsure about it.
Both facts and ethics pose problems.
Huge strides have undoubtedly been made in reducing global poverty, more through growth and globalization than through aid from abroad.
The number of poor people has fallen in the past 40 years from more than two billion to just under one billion – a remarkable feat, given the increase in world population and the long-term slowing of global economic growth, especially since 2008.
While impressive and wholly welcome, poverty reduction has not come without a cost.
The globalization that has rescued so many in poor countries has harmed some people in rich countries, as factories and jobs migrated to where labor is cheaper.
This seemed to be an ethically acceptable price to pay, because those who were losing were already so much wealthier (and healthier) than those who were gaining.
A long-standing cause of discomfort is that those of us who make these judgments are not exactly well placed to assess the costs.
Like many in academia and in the development industry, I am among globalization’s greatest beneficiaries – those who are able to sell our services in markets that are larger and richer than our parents could have dreamed of.
Globalization is less splendid for those who not only don’t reap its benefits, but suffer from its impact.
We have long known that less-educated and lower-income Americans, for example, have seen little economic gain for four decades, and that the bottom end of the US labor market can be a brutal environment.
But just how badly are these Americans suffering from globalization?
Are they much better off than the Asians now working in the factories that used to be in their hometowns?
Most undoubtedly are.
But several million Americans – black, white, and Hispanic – now live in households with per capita income of less than $2 a day, essentially the same standard that the World Bank uses to define destitution-level poverty in India or Africa.
Finding shelter in the United States on that income is so difficult that $2-a-day poverty is almost certainly much worse in the US than $2-a-day poverty in India or Africa.
Beyond that, America’s much-vaunted equality of opportunity is under threat.
Towns and cities that have lost their factories to globalization have also lost their tax base and find it hard to maintain quality schools – the escape route for the next generation.
Elite schools recruit the wealthy to pay their bills, and court minorities to redress centuries of discrimination; but this no doubt fosters resentment among the white working class, whose kids find no place in this brave new world.
My own work with Anne Case reveals more signs of distress.
We have documented a rising tide of “deaths of despair” among white non-Hispanics – from suicide, alcohol abuse, and accidental overdoses of prescription and illegal drugs.
Overall death rates in the US were higher in 2015 than 2014, and life expectancy has fallen.
We can argue about the measurement of material living standards, whether inflation is overstated and the rise in living standards understated, or whether schools are really that bad everywhere.
But deaths are hard to explain away.
Perhaps it is not so clear that the greatest needs are on the other side of the world.
Citizenship comes with a set of rights and responsibilities that we do not share with those in other countries.
Yet the “cosmopolitan” part of the ethical guideline ignores any special obligations we have toward our fellow citizens.
We can think about these rights and obligations as a kind of mutual insurance contract: We refuse to tolerate certain kinds of inequality for our fellow citizens, and each of us has a responsibility to help – and a right to expect help – in the face of collective threats.
These responsibilities do not invalidate or override our responsibilities to those who are suffering elsewhere in the world, but they do mean that if we judge only by material need, we risk leaving out important considerations.
When citizens believe that the elite care more about those across the ocean than those across the train tracks, insurance has broken down, we divide into factions, and those who are left behind become angry and disillusioned with a politics that no longer serves them.
We may not agree with the remedies that they seek, but we ignore their real grievances at their peril and ours.
Globalization Marches On
LONDON – In a recent symposium in the Financial Times on globalization’s prospects in 2011, the columnist Gideon Rachman observed that, “When Barack Obama visited India recently, the US President warned his hosts that the debate about globalization has reopened in the West,” and that “a backlash…is forming…and growing in advanced economies.”
But Rachman’s alarmism is misplaced.
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new.
Articulate intellectuals and groups such as labor unions and environmental organizations in the advanced economies have voiced anti-globalization fears and sentiments for at least a quarter-century.
The fear of globalization, however, began historically in the East, not the West.
After World War II, the West dismantled barriers to trade and investment flows, and worked to eliminate exchange controls and move to currency convertibility.
What was sometimes called the liberal international economic order was the order of the day, and it was embraced by public opinion as well.
By contrast, the East generally embraced the fearful view that, as the Chilean sociologist Oswaldo Sunkel put it, integration into the international economy would lead to disintegration of the national economy.
Many intellectuals shared this dark anti-globalization vision, and policymakers in much of the East were not far behind.
Indeed, the West accepted the view that globalization would result (as with trade) in mutual gain, embracing what I called in 1997 the notion of “benign neglect.”
In the case of foreign investment and aid flows, the West went further, viewing them as being motivated by altruism, or “benign intent,” whereas the East regarded globalization in a world of poor and rich nations as implying “malign impact.”
In some analyses, malign impact turned into a more sinister “malign intent.”
Thus, foreign aid was regarded as a plot to trap poor nations in a neo-colonial embrace.
What happened next was what I have called an “ironic reversal.”
As the benefits of globalization became manifest, and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident, policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake.
But then fear of globalization moved to the West.
The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West, which had superior infrastructure and human capital; now, the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East, which had abundant, cheap labor.
The longstanding stagnation in wages for unskilled labor was attributed to low-cost, labor-intensive imports, ignoring the corollary that Western workers’ consumption of labor-intensive Asian goods offset the effect on real wages.
To take another example, the East worried about a “brain drain” of professionals to the West, where opportunities seemed to be more plentiful.
Today, the West is witnessing anti-globalization opposition from members of professional groups, who fear the loss of their jobs to foreign counterparts.
Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in “The Ballad of East and West”:  “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”
Given the ironic reversal of globalization fears, Kipling is still right: convergence has continued to elude East and West.
The current crisis did not create the debate about globalization now heard in the West; it only made it slightly more salient.
Yet the crisis may be tilting Western policy outcomes in favor of globalization.
For example, on trade, there has been a remarkable commitment to efforts – largely successful – to avoid significant backsliding into protectionism.
Moreover, the G-20 leaders have continued to express the need to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade-liberalization negotiations.
There are also initiatives such as the appointment by the governments of Britain, Germany, Indonesia, and Turkey of a High-Level Expert Trade Group, with Peter Sutherland, former Director General of GATT and the WTO, and myself as co-chairs.
The four governments will report at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos on how to conclude Doha this year.
In other words, Kipling could yet be proved wrong.
A reversal in the West is possible, perhaps even likely.
So the current crisis may thus, accidentally, establish a pro-globalization consensus that spans East and West.
Globalization and its New Discontents
NEW YORK – Fifteen years ago, I wrote a little book, entitled Globalization and its Discontents, describing growing opposition in the developing world to globalizing reforms.
It seemed a mystery: people in developing countries had been told that globalization would increase overall wellbeing. So why had so many people become so hostile to it?
Now, globalization’s opponents in the emerging markets and developing countries have been joined by tens of millions in the advanced countries.
Opinion polls, including a careful study by Stanley Greenberg and his associates for the Roosevelt Institute, show that trade is among the major sources of discontent for a large share of Americans.
Similar views are apparent in Europe.
How can something that our political leaders – and many an economist – said would make everyone better off be so reviled?
One answer occasionally heard from the neoliberal economists who advocated for these policies is that people are better off.
They just don’t know it. Their discontent is a matter for psychiatrists, not economists.
But income data suggest that it is the neoliberals who may benefit from therapy. Large segments of the population in advanced countries have not been doing well: in the US, the bottom 90% has endured income stagnation for a third of a century.
Median income for full-time male workers is actually lower in real (inflation-adjusted) terms than it was 42 years ago.
At the bottom, real wages are comparable to their level 60 years ago.
The effects of the economic pain and dislocation that many Americans are experiencing are even showing up in health statistics.
For example, the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, this year’s Nobel laureate, have shown that life expectancy among segments of white Americans is declining.
Things are a little better in Europe – but only a little better.
Branko Milanovic’s new book Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization provides some vital insights, looking at the big winners and losers in terms of income over the two decades from 1988 to 2008.
Among the big winners were the global 1%, the world’s plutocrats, but also the middle class in newly emerging economies.
Among the big losers – those who gained little or nothing – were those at the bottom and the middle and working classes in the advanced countries.
Globalization is not the only reason, but it is one of the reasons.
Under the assumption of perfect markets (which underlies most neoliberal economic analyses), free trade equalizes the wages of unskilled workers around the world.
Trade in goods is a substitute for the movement of people. Importing goods from China – goods that require a lot of unskilled workers to produce – reduces the demand for unskilled workers in Europe and the US.
This force is so strong that if there were no transportation costs, and if the US and Europe had no other source of competitive advantage, such as in technology, eventually it would be as if Chinese workers continued to migrate to the US and Europe until wage differences had been eliminated entirely.
Not surprisingly, the neoliberals never advertised this consequence of trade liberalization, as they claimed – one could say lied – that all would benefit.
The failure of globalization to deliver on the promises of mainstream politicians has surely undermined trust and confidence in the “establishment.”
And governments’ offers of generous bailouts for the banks that had brought on the 2008 financial crisis, while leaving ordinary citizens largely to fend for themselves, reinforced the view that this failure was not merely a matter of economic misjudgments.
In the US, Congressional Republicans even opposed assistance to those who were directly hurt by globalization.
More generally, neoliberals, apparently worried about adverse incentive effects, have opposed welfare measures that would have protected the losers.
But they can’t have it both ways: if globalization is to benefit most members of society, strong social-protection measures must be in place.
The Scandinavians figured this out long ago; it was part of the social contract that maintained an open society – open to globalization and changes in technology.
Neoliberals elsewhere have not – and now, in elections in the US and Europe, they are having their comeuppance.
Globalization is, of course, only one part of what is going on; technological innovation is another part.
But all of this openness and disruption were supposed to make us richer, and the advanced countries could have introduced policies to ensure that the gains were widely shared.
Instead, they pushed for policies that restructured markets in ways that increased inequality and undermined overall economic performance; growth actually slowed as the rules of the game were rewritten to advance the interests of banks and corporations – the rich and powerful – at the expense of everyone else.
Workers’ bargaining power was weakened; in the US, at least, competition laws didn’t keep up with the times; and existing laws were inadequately enforced.
Financialization continued apace and corporate governance worsened.
Now, as I point out in my recent book Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy, the rules of the game need to be changed again – and this must include measures to tame globalization.
The two new large agreements that President Barack Obama has been pushing – the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the EU and the US – are moves in the wrong direction.
The main message of Globalization and its Discontents was that the problem was not globalization, but how the process was being managed.
Unfortunately, the management didn’t change.
Fifteen years later, the new discontents have brought that message home to the advanced economies.
Debunking America’s Populist Narrative
BERKELEY – One does not need to be particularly good at hearing to decipher the dog whistles being used during this year’s election campaign in the United States.
Listen even briefly, and you will understand that Mexicans and Chinese are working with Wall Street to forge lousy trade deals that rob American workers of their rightful jobs, and that Muslims want to blow everyone up.
All of this fear mongering is scarier than the usual election-year fare.
It is frightening to people in foreign countries, who can conclude only that voters in the world’s only superpower have become dangerously unbalanced.
And it is frightening to Americans, who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped – that they were living in a republic based on the traditions established by George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.
But what is even more unsettling is the political reality this rhetoric reflects.
There can be no comparing Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’s policy-oriented critique of neoliberalism to the incoherent bluster of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz on the Republican side.
And yet, on both the right and the left, a common narrative is emerging – one that seeks to explain why the incomes of working- and middle-class Americans have stagnated over the past generation.
Unfortunately, this narrative, if used as a basis for policymaking, will benefit neither the US nor the rest of the world; worse, it has yet to be seriously challenged.
For decades, senior Republican politicians and intellectuals have been uninterested in educating the American people about the realities of economic policy.
And Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has been too busy trying to fend off Sanders’s challenge.
Broadly, the narrative goes something like this.
American middle- and working-class wages have stagnated because Wall Street pressed companies to outsource the valuable jobs that made up America’s manufacturing base, first to low-wage Mexicans and then to the Chinese.
Moreover, this was a bipartisan effort, with both parties unified behind financial deregulation and trade deals that undermined the US economy.
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) led to the export of high-quality manufacturing jobs to Mexico.
Then the US established permanent normal trade relations with China and refused to brand its government a currency manipulator.
The reason this narrative is wrong is simple.
There are good reasons why the US adopted policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization.
In helping Mexico, China, and other developing countries grow, the US is gaining richer trading partners.
Furthermore, there is a strong case that US national security will be improved if, 50 years from now, schoolchildren around the world learn how America helped their countries prosper, rather than trying to keep them as poor as possible for as long as possible.
It was not globalization that caused incomes to stagnate.
Trade with countries like China and Mexico is just one factor affecting income distribution in the US, and it is by no means the most important one.
The reason that incomes have stagnated is that American politicians have failed to implement policies to manage globalization’s effects.
As Steve Cohen and I argue in our book Concrete Economics, macroeconomic management requires the government to do what it always did before 1980: pragmatically adopt policies that promote equitable growth.
There were good reasons for the US to offload industries that required low wages to be globally competitive.
But there was little reason for the US to offload industries that had become important “technology drivers.”
Nor were there good reasons for a lot of other bad decisions, such as allowing the financial industry to profit by convincing investors to bear risks they should not and allowing health-care providers to profit from administration at the expense of the care and treatment of the sick.
Other bad decisions include incarcerating 2% of the country’s young men and concluding that America’s economic problems would be solved if only the rich could keep more of their money.
It is not difficult to see where the blame lies.
As Mark Kleiman of NYU’s Marron Institute points out, the Republican Party’s rigid and die-hard ideological opposition to “taxing the rich [has] destroyed, on a practical level, the theoretical basis for believing that free trade benefits everyone.”
It is difficult to argue for redistributing the benefits of globalization when you believe that the market channels gains to those who deserve them.
Nor can you ameliorate the painful effects of globalization if you believe that social-insurance programs turn their beneficiaries into lethargic “takers.”
It is not globalization, poor negotiation tactics, low-wage Mexicans workers, or the overly clever Chinese that bear responsibility for what is ailing America.
The responsibility lies instead with politicians peddling ideology over practicality – and thus with the citizens who elect them, as well as those who don’t bother to vote at all.
The West’s Decline Would Hurt China
HONG KONG – Official Chinese media are having a field day touting the dysfunction of Western democracies.
Between the British vote to “Brexit” the European Union and the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency, not to mention increasingly frequent terrorist attacks, they have plenty of evidence.
But the truth is that the West’s loss is not China’s gain.
The hope, of course, is that the current travails of democracies around the world could boost the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party.
And, indeed, a commentary in People’s Daily, the CCP’s official newspaper, portrayed the Brexit vote as a reflection of the fundamental flaws of Western democracies.
The same paper used Trump’s rise to show that, in the American system, political leaders are “helpless” to address “complex social conflicts” like racial tensions and other sources of popular discontent.
The Global Times, an ultra-nationalist tabloid affiliated with the People’s Daily, seemed to suggest that recent terrorist attacks in the West were a harbinger of some kind of democratic apocalypse.
The West may be facing some mysterious and unthinkable “change,” intoned the tabloid.
Given the CCP’s ideological hostility to the West, and its zero-sum geopolitical mindset, such gloating should come as no surprise.
Indeed, the CCP has long used challenges that arise in democratic countries as part of its never-ending effort to enhance its own legitimacy.
Claiming that democracy barely works in the West, the Party argues that it would be disastrous for China.
Moreover, so long as China’s government is delivering consistently rising standards of living, as it has been over the last few decades, there is no need, according to the authorities, even to consider alternative systems.
But there is little evidence that democratic tumult translates into autocratic legitimacy.
On the contrary, dictatorships have historically fallen, regardless of the fortune of Western democracies.
When the so-called third wave of democratization began in the mid-1970s, Western democracies were mired in stagflation and the political trauma of the Vietnam War.
The fall of communism in the former Soviet bloc coincided with the reinvigoration of Western democracies in the 1980s.
When the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, Western democracies were struggling with the consequences of the global financial crisis of 2008.
All of this suggests that autocrats in China should not be holding their breath for some Brexit-induced surge in support.
Though stories of democratic dysfunction can give people living under autocratic rule a negative impression of democracy, the effect is most likely short-lived.
As long as dictatorships mistreat their own people and fail to improve their lives, their legitimacy will be challenged.
Of course, China is no ordinary autocracy.
But what makes it unique – the link between the CCP’s authority and its ability to sustain economic growth – does not make its gloating any more rational.
After all, one of the keys to China’s economic success is its integration into a global economy dominated by the Western democracies, which buy roughly 60% of Chinese exports.
In other words, the CCP derives more legitimacy from Western democracies’ success than it would from their failure.
No good businessperson would hope their best customers go bankrupt.
It makes little sense that the CCP is so pleased about the struggles of China’s most valuable trading partners.
The factors driving the challenges facing the Western democracies today hold even worse implications for China.
Support for Brexit and Trump is rooted largely in voters’ rejection of globalization.
Regardless of how Brexit or the US election plays out, it is very likely that governments in Western democracies will respond to voter angst and take measures that imply a return to some degree of protectionism.
As the world’s largest exporter, China will not escape the damaging economic consequences of such efforts.
In that context, the legitimacy of the CCP, already challenged by China’s economic slowdown, could erode further.
Instead of gloating, China’s leaders should be watching developments in the Western democracies with concern – and start planning for their own difficult times ahead.
But they also included workers – both blue- and white-collar – who were among the losers from globalization, but who nonetheless remained loyal, either because they were socially and religiously conservative, or because center-left parties were formally supporters of unions, workers’ rights, and entitlement programs.
Globalization’s Assassin
The world’s first wave of economic globalization, led by the British Empire in the nineteenth century, came to an end literally with a bang on a Sunday afternoon in 1914, when Gavrilo Princip killed (with two uncannily well-aimed bullets) Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
The years that followed witnessed pan-European carnage, instability throughout the 1920’s, and the rise of fascism and communism, culminating in the death of countless millions during World War II.
Is today’s globalizing era also coming to an end?
If so, it may not necessarily end with a repeat of the slaughters of the last century, but with an economic retrenchment that brings economic stagnation and consigns billions of people to grinding poverty.
Various candidates have been proposed for the role of globalization’s assassin.
But one little noticed, yet likely, aspirant has been sneaking up on the world economy: the growing tendency to limit the free circulation of people, to “fence in” the rich world.
We see the menace of this tendency constantly nowadays, but we perceive it in such a seemingly unthreatening way that we may well become accustomed to it rather than arresting it.
Globalization means free movement of capital, goods, technology, ideas, and, yes, people.
Any globalization that is limited to the first three or four freedoms but omits the last one is partial and not sustainable.
As soon as people cannot move, there will be little to stop governments from limiting the free movement of goods or other factors of production.
After all, if over-populated countries with high unemployment cannot export people, why not reach for higher tariff barriers to protect the jobs they have?
But what of the unemployed who become locked into their societies?
The war on terror has shown us the dangers that can arise from the social frustrations that often result.
Nevertheless, the “fencing-in” of the rich world continues apace.
The United States plans to construct a veritable “Mexican Wall” to keep poor people from crossing into Texas or California.
Likewise, hundreds, if not thousands, of Africans die every year trying to reach the shores of Fortress Europe.
Efforts to restrict people’s movement between countries expose the soft underbelly of globalization: the deepening gap between countries’ mean incomes.
Rather than poor countries growing faster than the rich (as we would expect from Economics 101), mainly the reverse is true.
Between 1980 and 2002, average annual per capita income growth in the rich world (defined as the “old” OECD members) was almost 2%, compared to just 0.1% in the 42 least developed countries.
Indeed, average income in Latin America is now barely above its 1980 level.
This huge gap spurs migration.
People nowadays know much more about conditions in different countries than they did in the past, and if moving across a border means that their income can be multiplied several-fold, they will try to do it.
This is why today’s most contentious borders separate economies where the income gaps between people on the two sides are the greatest.
There are four such global hot spots: the borders between the US and Mexico, Spain and Morocco, Greece (and Italy) and the southern Balkans, and Indonesia and Singapore (or Malaysia).
The income gaps range from more than seven to one in the latter case to 4.5 to one in the case of Spain and Morocco, 4.3 to one between the US and Mexico, and four to one between Greece and Albania.
Income differences were not always so huge.
In 1980, average income in the US was a little more than three times that of Mexico, the gap between Singapore and Indonesia was 5.3 to one, and the difference between Spain and Morocco 3.5 to one.
Even the gap between Greece and Albania, at three to one, was narrower than it is now.
So income gaps between all these contiguous countries have increased significantly during the last quarter-century.
So it is little wonder that it is in these places that most illegal immigration and human trafficking occurs – pirates in the Straits of Malacca, fast boats between Albania and Italy, and desperate human cargoes from Africa and Latin America.
If today’s globalization continues to widen income gaps, the waves of migration will grow.
So the rich world will, in a knee-jerk response, erect ever-higher barriers to stem the human tide.
If globalization, which has so enriched the world’s wealthiest countries, is to continue, governments must find ways to increase incomes more evenly.
Otherwise, today’s “fencing in” of the rich world will increase the risk of a backlash against free circulation of goods and capital, as well as of political instability punctuated by terrorism.
Global income redistribution by the rich countries should be viewed as a matter not of charity, but of enlightened self-interest.
Globalization’s Government
NEW YORK – We live in an era in which the most important forces affecting every economy are global, not local.
What happens “abroad” – in China, India, and elsewhere – powerfully affects even an economy as large as the United States. 
Economic globalization has, of course, produced some large benefits for the world, including the rapid spread of advanced technologies such as the Internet and mobile telephony.
It has also reduced poverty sharply in many emerging economies – indeed, for this reason alone, the world economy needs to remain open and interconnected.
Yet globalization has also created major problems that need to be addressed.
First, it has increased the scope for tax evasion, owing to a rapid proliferation of tax havens around the world. Multinational companies have many more opportunities than before to dodge their fair and efficient share of taxation.
Moreover, globalization has created losers as well as winners.
In high-income countries, notably the US, Europe, and Japan, the biggest losers are workers who lack the education to compete effectively with low-paid workers in developing countries.
Hardest hit are workers in rich countries who lack a college education. Such workers have lost jobs by the millions.
Those who have kept their jobs have seen their wages stagnate or decline.
Globalization has also fueled contagion.
The 2008 financial crisis started on Wall Street, but quickly spread to the entire world, pointing to the need for global cooperation on banking and finance.
Climate change, infectious diseases, terrorism, and other ills that can easily cross borders demand a similar global response. 
What globalization requires, therefore, are smart government policies.
Governments should promote high-quality education, to ensure that young people are prepared to face global competition.
They should raise productivity by building modern infrastructure and promoting science and technology. And governments should cooperate globally to regulate those parts of the economy – notably finance and the environment – in which problems in one country can spill over to other parts of the world.
The need for highly effective government in the era of globalization is the key message of my new book, The Price of Civilization.
Simply put, we need more government nowadays, not less.
Yet the role of government also needs to be modernized, in line with the specific challenges posed by an interconnected world economy.
I wrote The Price of Civilization out of the conviction that the US government has failed to understand and respond to the challenges of globalization ever since it began to impact America’s economy in the 1970’s.
Rather than respond to globalization with more government spending on education, infrastructure, and technology, Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 by pledging to slash government spending and cut taxes.
For 30 years, the US has been going in the wrong direction, cutting the role of government in the domestic economy rather than promoting the investments needed to modernize the economy and workforce.
The rich have benefited in the short run, by getting massive tax breaks. The poor have suffered from job losses and cuts in government services.
Economic inequality has reached a high not seen since the Great Depression.
These adverse trends have been exacerbated by domestic politics. The rich have used their wealth to strengthen their grip on power.
They pay for the expensive campaigns of presidents and congressmen, so presidents and congressmen help the rich – often at the expense of the rest of society.  The same syndrome – in which the rich have gained control of the political system (or strengthened their control of it) – now afflicts many other countries.
Yet there are some important signs around the world that people are fed up with governments that cater to the rich while ignoring everyone else.
Start with the growing calls for greater social justice.
The upheavals in Tunis and Cairo were first called the Arab Spring, because they seemed to be contained to the Arab world.
But then we saw protests in Tel Aviv, Santiago, London, and now even in the US.
These protests have called first and foremost for more inclusive politics, rather than the corrupt politics of oligarchy.
Moreover, US President Barack Obama is gradually shifting toward the left.
After three years in which his administration coddled corporate lobbyists, he has finally begun to emphasize the need for the rich to pay more taxes.
This has come late in his term, and he might well continue to favor the rich and Wall Street in exchange for campaign contributions in 2012, but there is a glimmer of hope that Obama will defend a fairer budget policy.
Several European governments, including Spain, Denmark, and Greece, also seem to be moving in the same direction.
Spain recently imposed a new wealth tax on high-net-worth taxpayers.
Denmark elected a center-left government committed to higher government spending financed by new taxes on the rich.
And Greece has just voted for a new property tax to help close its yawning fiscal deficit.
The European Commission has also called for a new Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) to raise around $75 billion per year.
The Commission has finally agreed that Europe’s financial sector has been under-taxed.
The new FTT might still face political opposition in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, with its large and influential banking sector, but at least the principle of greater tax fairness is high on the European agenda.
The world’s most successful economies today are in Scandinavia.
By using high taxes to finance a high level of government services, these countries have balanced high prosperity with social justice and environmental sustainability.
This is the key to well-being in today’s globalized economy.
Perhaps more parts of the world – and especially the world’s young people – are beginning to recognize this new reality.
Globalizing NATO
PRINCETON –&nbsp;Next week, NATO’s 28 members will meet in Chicago for their annual summit.
Sixty-two years after the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, binding the United States, Canada, and ten European states to consider an attack on one an attack on all, NATO is transforming itself into a twenty-first-century global security organization.
The result will be a safer world.
In 1949, the world was rapidly dividing into two principle political-military blocs, East and West, alongside a large “non-aligned movement.”
NATO faced off against the Warsaw Pact, created by the Soviet Union and its allies in 1955.
Within both blocs, smaller powers clustered around the superpower.
No flexibility existed within either bloc for smaller groups of members to deploy alliance assets.
Today, NATO is becoming, in the words of its secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, “a hub of a network of security partnerships and a center for consultation on global security issues.”
It is a “globally connected institution,” with more than 40 individual country partners and growing ties to other international organizations.
Indeed, the country partners include all of Europe’s non-NATO countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden, and aspiring and possible NATO members such as Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Belarus, and even Russia.
Virtually all of the Central Asian countries – from Turkmenistan to Kazakhstan, as well as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – are partners, as is the entire Maghreb, from Morocco to Egypt, as well as Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.
Finally, Pacific partners include Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and Mongolia.
On the organizational side, NATO describes itself as having developed “close working relations” with the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
It also collaborates regularly with the African Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration, the World Bank, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
If one draws links radiating outward from NATO to all of these different countries and organizations, the result is a security network that has multiple hubs and clusters – much like a map of the Internet or of planets and galaxies.
This world is no longer unipolar, bipolar, or even multipolar, because the actors that matter are not single states but groups of states that are more or less densely connected.
It is a multi-hub security network, in which the hubs are regional organizations of different sizes and strengths.
This structural shift has enormous practical significance.
For starters, it means that not only NATO’s military resources, but also its human capital and practical knowledge in combating many different kinds of threats are available globally.
NATO has created a Comprehensive Crisis and Operations Management Center that brings together civilian and military expertise on crisis identification, planning, operations, reconstruction, and stabilization capabilities in ways that are explicitly designed to connect NATO headquarters in Europe to “the networked world.”
Second, NATO’s own identity is becoming that of an alliance that exists to empower – to offer assistance and partnership – as much as to overpower.
NATO is no longer just a hammer; it is an entire toolbox of security options.
These options include developing counter-networks to meet networked security threats such as terrorism and proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological materials, as well as highly decentralized threats such as piracy.
As a result, when a crisis like the war in East Timor in 1999 or last year’s political stalemate in Côte d’Ivoire arises, NATO can backstop whichever country or group of countries chooses to take the lead in carrying out a UN mandate.
NATO members themselves also have much more flexibility to draw on NATO’s collective assets.
Even skeptics of NATO expansion and operations like the intervention in Libya now recognize that joint operations by member countries, operating under a UN mandate and in conjunction with regional partners, is likely to be a model for the future.
As General Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser for President George H.W. Bush, observed recently, the UN Charter originally envisioned a standing military force to enforce Security Council resolutions – a vision that the NATO partner model might ultimately realize.
Power in a network flows from connectedness, or what network theorists call “centrality.”
The most powerful member of a network is the node that has the most connections to others, which means that a node can increase its power not only by adding connections directly, but also by increasing the connectedness of nearby nodes.
In other words, the US can increase its own power both by connecting to other NATO members (and then ensuring that NATO is connected to as many other countries and organizations as possible) and by increasing the connectedness of those other countries and organizations.
If NATO connects with the African Union, for example, and increases the AU’s connectedness, then both NATO and the AU become more central to the network and hence more powerful in terms of their ability to exercise influence and marshal resources.
The logic of centrality as a source of power creates a virtuous circle, in which members of a network gain advantage by bringing more members into the network and connecting more densely to them.
That is exactly the logic behind NATO’s transformation.
The immediate topic on the agenda in Chicago next week will be getting NATO forces out of Afghanistan.
But the longer-term subject will be getting as many countries as possible into the global NATO security network.
Global Justice and Military Intervention
MELBOURNE – The world has watched in horror as Libya’s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi uses his military to attack protesters opposed to his rule, killing hundreds or possibly thousands of unarmed civilians. Many of his own men have refused to fire on their own people, instead defecting to the rebels or flying their planes to nearby Malta, so Qaddafi has called in mercenaries from neighboring countries who are more willing to obey his orders.
World leaders were quick to condemn Qaddafi’s actions.
On February 26, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose an arms embargo on Libya, urge member nations to freeze assets owned by Qaddafi and his family, and refer the regime’s violence to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of those responsible.
This is the first time that the Security Council has unanimously referred a situation involving human rights violations to the International Criminal Court, and it is remarkable that countries that are not members of the Court – including the United States, Russia, and China – nevertheless supported the referral.
The resolution can thus be seen as another incremental step towards the establishment of a global system of justice able to punish those who commit gross violations of human rights, regardless of their political or legal status in their own country.
Yet, in another way, the Security Council resolution was a disappointment. The situation in Libya became a test of how seriously the international community takes the idea of a responsibility to protect people from their rulers.
The idea is an old one, but its modern form is rooted in the tragic failure to intervene in the Rwandan genocide in 1994. A subsequent UN inquiry concluded that as few as 2,500 properly trained military personnel could have prevented the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis.
Former US President Bill Clinton has said that the mistake he most regrets making during his presidency was his failure to push for intervention in Rwanda.
Kofi Annan, who was then UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace-Keeping Operations, described the situation at the UN at the time as a “terrible and humiliating” paralysis.
When Annan became Secretary-General, he urged the development of principles that would indicate when it is justifiable for the international community to intervene to prevent gross violations of human rights. In response, Canada’s government established an International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, which recommended that military intervention could be justified, as an extraordinary measure, where large-scale loss of life is occurring or imminent, owing to deliberate state action or the state’s refusal or failure to act.
These principles were endorsed by the UN General Assembly at its special World Summit in 2005 and discussed again in 2009, with an overwhelming majority of states supporting them.
The principle fits the situation in Libya today.
Yet the Security Council resolution contains no mention of the possibility of military intervention – not even the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent Qaddafi from using planes to attack protesters.
One body with a special concern to transform the idea of the responsibility to protect into a cause for action is the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, at the City University of New York. It has called on UN members to uphold their 2005 commitments and put the responsibility to protect into action in Libya.
In addition to arguing that the responsibility to protect can justify military intervention, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty recommended a set of precautionary principles.
For example, military intervention should be a last resort, and the consequences of action should not be likely to be worse than the consequences of inaction.
Whether these precautionary principles are satisfied in Libya requires expert judgment of the specifics of the situation. No one wants another drawn-out war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But Libya is not Iraq or Afghanistan – its population is only about one-fifth of either country’s, and there is a strong popular movement for a democratic form of government. Assuming that foreign military forces rapidly overwhelmed Qaddafi’s troops, they would soon be able to withdraw and leave the Libyan people to decide their own future.
At the time of writing, it is arguable that other sanctions or threats, short of military intervention, would be sufficient to deter more widespread bloodshed.
Perhaps the rebels and the sanctions can overthrow Qaddafi unaided, without great loss of life.
It is also unclear whether military intervention would cause more deaths than it prevented.
But these are questions that the international community needs to ask, and that the Security Council should have been discussing, so that the principle of the responsibility to protect – and its possible implications for military action – become part of our understanding of the requirements of international law and global ethics.

Global Macroeconomic Cooperation
NEW YORK – The world has yet to achieve the macroeconomic policy coordination that will be needed to restore economic growth following the Great Crash of 2008.
In much of the world, consumers are now cutting their spending in response to a fall in their wealth and a fear of unemployment.
The overwhelming force behind the current collapse of jobs, output, and trade flows, is even more important than the financial panic that followed Lehman Brothers’ default in September 2008.
There is, of course, no return to the situation that preceded the Great Crash.
The worldwide financial bubble cannot and should not be recreated.
But if the world cooperates effectively, the decline in consumer demand can be offset by a valuable increase in investment spending to address the most critical needs on the planet: sustainable energy, safe water and sanitation, a reduction of pollution, improved public health, and increased food production for the poor.
The United States, Europe, and Asia have all experienced a collapse of wealth due to the fall of stock markets and housing prices.
There is not yet an authoritative measurement of the wealth decline and of how it is distributed worldwide, but it is probably around $15 trillion lower than the peak in the US, and perhaps $10 trillion lower in both Europe and Asia.
A combined wealth decline of around $25 trillion would be roughly 60% of one year’s global income.
The decline in US wealth as a share of the US economy is even larger, around 100% of annual income, and perhaps 70% of annual income in Europe and Asia.
The usual assumption is that household consumption falls by around $0.05 for each $1 decline in household wealth.
This would mean a direct negative shock to household spending in the US of around 5% of national income, and of around 3.5% in Europe and Asia.
The size of this downturn is so large that unemployment will rise sharply in all major regions of the world economy, perhaps reaching 9-10% in the US.
Households will gradually save enough to restore their wealth, and household consumption will gradually recover as well.
Yet this will occur too slowly to prevent a rapid rise in unemployment and a massive shortfall of production relative to potential output.
The world therefore needs to stimulate other kinds of spending.
One powerful way to boost the world economy and to help meet future needs is to increase spending on key infrastructure projects, mainly directed at transportation (roads, ports, rail, and mass transit), sustainable energy (wind, solar, geothermal, carbon-capture and sequestration, and long-distance power transmission grids), pollution control, and water and sanitation.
There is a strong case for global cooperation to increase these public investments in the developing economies, and especially in the world’s poorest regions.
These regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia, are suffering harshly from the global crisis, owing to falling export earnings, remittances, and capital inflows.
Poor regions are also suffering from climate changes such as more frequent droughts, caused by rich countries’ greenhouse-gas emissions.
At the same time, impoverished countries have huge needs for infrastructure, especially roads, rail, renewable energy, water and sanitation, and for improved current delivery of vital life-saving services, including health care and support for food production.
The G-20, which comprises the world’s largest economies, offers the natural setting for global policy coordination.
The next G-20 meeting in London in early April is a crucial opportunity for timely action.
The leading economies – especially the US, European Union, and Japan – should establish new programs to finance infrastructure investments in low-income countries.
The new lending should be at least $100 billion per year, directed towards developing countries.
The new financing would include direct loans from rich countries’ export-credit agencies to enable poor countries to borrow long term (for example, 40 years) to build roads, power grids, renewable energy generation, ports, fiber optic networks, and water and sanitation systems.
The G-20 should also increase the lending capacity of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and other international financial institutions. 
Japan, with a surplus of saving, a strong currency, massive foreign exchange reserves, and factories without domestic orders, should take the lead in providing this funding for infrastructure.
Moreover, Japan can boost its own economy and those of the poorest countries by directing its own industrial production to the infrastructure needs of the developing world.
Cooperation can turn the sharp and frightening decline in worldwide consumption spending into a global opportunity to invest more in the world’s future well being.
By directing resources away from rich countries’ consumption to developing countries’ investment needs, the world can achieve a “triple” victory.
Higher investment and social spending in poor countries will stimulate the entire world economy, spur economic development, and promote environmental sustainability through investments in renewable energy, efficient water use, and sustainable agriculture.
Global Malaise in 2006?
The almighty American consumer had another banner year in 2005, helping sustain global economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than in 2004.
As in recent years, he consumed at or above his income level, and the United States as a whole spent well beyond its means, borrowing from the rest of the world at a feverish pace in 2005 – more than $2 billion a day.
A year ago, most pundits argued that this was unsustainable.
It evidently was sustainable, at least for one more year.
But it nonetheless remains true that whatever is unsustainable will not be sustained, which creates great risks for the US and global economy in 2006.
Two economic surprises prolonged the good times in 2005.
First, while the US Federal Reserve continued hiking short-term interest rates, long-terms rates did not increase in tandem, which allowed housing prices to continue rising.
This was centrally important to sustaining global growth, for the performance of world’s largest economy has been fueled by real estate in recent years, with individuals refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds, and with high prices leading to more construction.
But this is unlikely to continue.
Long-term interest rates almost certainly will eventually start to rise – and “eventually” increasingly looks like next year.
If so, Americans will have to spend more money on debt service, leaving them with less to spend on consumption of goods and services.
Moreover, real estate prices will most likely stop rising rapidly – indeed, they may even decline.
As a result, refinancing of mortgages will grind to a halt, leaving no money to draw out of housing to sustain Americans’ consumption binge.
On both accounts, aggregate demand will decline.
Is it possible that the cash-rich corporate sector will more than make up for the slack by increasing investment?
There may well be some increase in gross investment, as obsolete equipment and software are replaced. But there also is some evidence that innovation is slowing – perhaps the result of reduced investment in research in the past five years.
In any case, even if firms are cash-rich, they do not typically expand investment during periods when consumption is slowing.
Uncertainties about the economy are likely to insert an element of caution into companies’ investment decisions.
In short, it is more likely that moderating investment will exacerbate the consumer slowdown than that an acceleration of investment will offset it.
But this is not the only reason for bleaker prospects for America and the world in 2006.
The second surprise in 2005 was that while oil prices increased far more than expected, the economic dampening effect seemed somewhat muted in most places, at least until the last part of the year.
Because of higher oil prices, for example, America’s spending on oil imports has increased by roughly $50 billion a year – money that otherwise would have been spent mostly on goods made in America.
For most of 2005, Americans behaved as if they didn’t really believe that oil prices would remain high, at least for a while.
This is less startling than it may appear: econometric studies suggest that it takes a year to two before the full effects of oil-price increases are felt.
Now, with futures markets predicting that oil will be $50 to $60 a barrel for the next two years, demand for gas-guzzlers has evaporated, taking with it the prospects for America’s auto companies, whose corporate strategies have bet on low oil prices and America’s love affair with the SUV.
High oil prices are set to dampen economic performance in the rest of the world as well, although growth prospects look better than in the US.
China’s growth continues to astound the world; indeed, new GDP data suggest that its economy is 20% larger than previously thought.
Moreover, China’s surging growth will echo throughout much of Asia, including (in somewhat muted form) in Japan.
Europe continues to be a mixed picture, with the European Central Bank almost perversely raising interest rates even as Europe’s economy needs further stimulation to ensure its recovery.
As if that were not bad enough, Germany’s new government is promising to raise taxes.
Fiscal rectitude in the right place and the right time is to be commended; but this is the wrong place and the wrong time – and Germany’s recovery prospects will be dampened.
The main risk in 2006 is that America’s long-brewing problems come to a head globally: investors, finally taking heed of the large structural fiscal deficit, the yawning trade gap, and the high level of household indebtedness, may pull money out of the US in a panic.
Alternatively, rising interest rates and a downturn in the real estate market could so weaken consumer demand that the economy slips into recession, squeezing exporters in other countries that depend on the US market.
In either case, the US government, hamstrung by already-wide deficits, may feel powerless to respond with countercyclical fiscal policy.
With confidence in Bush’s economic management almost as low as confidence in his management of the Iraq war, there is every reason to worry that should one of these crises emerge, it will not be well managed.
But it is more likely that 2006 will just be another year of malaise: China’s significance within the global economy is still not large enough to offset weaknesses in the rest of the world.
America, too, will manage to muddle through again – leaving even higher levels of debt for the future.
In short, 2006 will be marked by mounting uncertainty about prospects for global economic growth, even as the distribution of the fruits of that growth remain dismally predictable.
In America, at least, 2006 is likely to be another year in which stagnant real wages freeze, or even erode, the living standards of those in the middle.
And, everywhere, it is likely to be another year in which the gap between the haves and the have-nots will widen.
A Global Marshall Plan
ROME – Despite ongoing efforts to catalyze global development cooperation, there have been significant obstacles to progress in recent years.
Fortunately, with major international meetings set for the second half of 2015, world leaders have an important opportunity to overcome them.
Such a turnaround has happened before.
At the turn of the century, international negotiations on economic development had also come to a grinding halt.
The Seattle ministerial of the World Trade Organization ended without decision, and after two decades of the Washington Consensus, developing countries were frustrated at the US-led international financial institutions.
Negotiations for the inaugural United Nations Financing for Development (FfD) conference in Monterrey, Mexico, seemed to be headed nowhere.
Then, on September 11, 2001, the United States was hit with major terrorist attacks – a tragic development that somehow catalyzed progress.
World leaders agreed to begin the Doha Development Round to ensure that trade negotiations would serve developing countries’ development aspirations.
And the 2002 Monterrey FfD conference produced major breakthroughs on foreign and domestic investment, foreign debt, international cooperation, trade, and systemic governance issues.
Of course, tragedy is not needed to kick-start progress.
This year’s major global meetings – the Conference on Financing for Development in July, the meeting at the United Nations to adopt Sustainable Development Goals in September, and the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December – should be sufficient.
And the efforts that have gone into preparing for these meetings suggest that there is a will to move forward.
But the right program is key.
The world needs a well-designed and far-reaching strategy to stimulate industrialization, modeled after the European Recovery Program – the American initiative that enabled Europe to rebuild after World War II.
The Marshall Plan, as it is better known, entailed a massive infusion of US aid to support national development efforts in Europe, and is still viewed by many Europeans as America’s finest hour.
The Marshall Plan’s impact was felt far beyond Europe’s borders, developing over the following decade into what is probably the most successful economic-development assistance project in human history.
Similar policies were introduced in Northeast Asia following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China and the Korean War.
Of course, there was a political motivation behind the Marshall Plan’s expansion.
By creating a cordon sanitaire of wealthy countries from Western Europe to Northeast Asia, the US hoped to contain the spread of communism at the start of the Cold War.
Developing countries that did not serve the same political ends were left out.
At its core, however, the Marshall Plan was an economic strategy – and a sound one at that.
Crucially, it represented a complete reversal of its predecessor, the Morgenthau Plan, which focused on de-industrialization – with poor results.
The plan’s aim – articulated by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in his 1945 book Germany is Our Problem – was to convert Germany into a “principally agricultural and pastoral” country, in order to prevent its involvement in any new wars.
By late 1946, however, economic hardship and unemployment in Germany spurred former US President Herbert Hoover to visit the country on a fact-finding mission.
Hoover’s third report of March 18, 1947, called the notion that Germany could be reduced to a pastoral state an “illusion,” which could not be achieved without exterminating or moving 25,000,000 people out of the country.
The only alternative was re-industrialization.
Less than three months later, Secretary of State George Marshall made his landmark speech at Harvard University announcing the policy reversal.
Germany and the rest of Europe were to be re-industrialized, he stated, including through heavy-handed state interventions, such as high duties, quotas, and import prohibitions.
Free trade would be possible only after reconstruction, when European countries could compete in international markets.
Marshall made three other important points in his short speech.
First, in noting the role that the breakdown of trade between urban and rural areas played in Germany’s economic slowdown, he recalled a centuries-old European economic insight: all wealthy countries have cities with a manufacturing sector.
“The remedy,” Marshall explained, “lies in…restoring the confidence of the European people,” so that “the manufacturer and the farmer” would be “able and willing to exchange their products for currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question.”
Second, Marshall argued that participatory institutions emerge from economic progress, not the other way around – the opposite of today’s conventional wisdom.
As he put it, the policy’s “purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world, so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.”
Third, Marshall emphasized that aid should be comprehensive and strategic, in order to foster real progress and development.
“Such assistance,” he declared, “must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop.
Any assistance that this government may render in the future should provide a cure, rather than a mere palliative.”
Marshall’s vision offers important lessons for world leaders seeking to accelerate development today, beginning with the need to reverse the effects of the Washington Consensus on developing and transition economies – effects that resemble those of the Morgenthau Plan.
Some countries – including large economies like China and India, which have long protected domestic industry – have been in a better position to benefit from economic globalization.
Others have experienced a decline in economic growth and real per capita income, as their industry and agricultural capacity have fallen, especially over the last two decades of the last century.
It is time to increase poor economies’ productive capacity and purchasing power, as occurred in Europe in the decade after Marshall’s speech.
Marshall’s insight that such shared economic development is the only way to create a lasting peace remains as true as ever.
The Global Obesity Threat
LONDON/MELBOURNE – In 2010, humanity passed an important milestone.
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, published in the British medical journal The Lancet, obesity became a bigger public-health problem than hunger.
Today, according to the latest edition of the study, more than 2.1 billion people – nearly 30% of the global population – are overweight or obese.
That is nearly two and a half times the number of adults and children who are undernourished.
Obesity is responsible for about 5% of deaths worldwide.
This crisis is not just a pressing health concern; it is also a threat to the global economy.
The total economic impact of obesity is about $2 trillion a year, or 2.8% of world GDP – roughly equivalent to the economic damage caused by smoking or armed violence, war, and terrorism, according to new research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).
And the problem is likely to worsen.
If the current trend continues, almost half of the world’s adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030.
As World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan has noted, “Not one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups.”
According to the OECD, from 2000 to 2013, the prevalence of obesity increased by at least 0.5% per year in 130 of the 196 countries for which data were collected.
This global epidemic is not confined to advanced countries.
As emerging economies climb out of poverty, their citizens are becoming fatter.
More than 60% of the world’s obese people live in developing countries, where rapid industrialization and urbanization are boosting incomes and therefore calorie intake.
In India and China, the prevalence of obesity in cities is 3-4 times the rate in rural areas.
Indeed, the evidence suggests that developing countries are especially vulnerable to the epidemic.
Obesity rates tend to explode in countries where food was once scarce and suddenly becomes plentiful.
In the mid-twentieth century, for example, a boom in phosphate mining transformed the Micronesian island state of Nauru from a land of food shortages and starvation to the world’s leader in obesity and type-2 diabetes.
In 2005, according to the WHO, 94% of men and 93% of women in Nauru were overweight, and more than 70% of the population was obese.
To make matters worse, in countries with limited public-health services, the cost of health care falls directly on the afflicted households.
As a result, obesity can lock in poverty and perpetuate inequality.
Through a review of 500 intervention trials around the world, MGI has identified 74 potential interventions that could be used to address obesity.
These include subsidized school meals, urban design that encourages walking, better nutritional labeling, restrictions on the advertising of high-calorie food and drinks, and fiscal measures.
Education concerning the risks of obesity is important, as is taking personal responsibility for one’s health, fitness, and weight.
But all the evidence shows that relying on knowledge about obesity and willpower is not enough to offset the evolutionary instinct to overeat.
These effects are compounded by lifestyles that require little or no physical activity.
People need help, and that means changing the environmental forces shaping their decisions – by, say, reducing standard portion sizes, altering marketing practices, and designing cities and educational establishments to make it easier for people to exercise or be active.
MGI was able to collect enough data on 44 of the 74 potential interventions to develop an initial assessment of their impact if they were scaled up to a national level.
If the United Kingdom, for example, were to deploy all 44 interventions, it could rein in obesity rates and help roughly 20% of its overweight and obese population return to a healthy weight within 5-10 years.
Over the long term, savings from reduced health-care spending and gains from higher productivity could outweigh the investment needed to deliver interventions.
In the UK, reversing obesity trends could save the National Health Service about $1.2 billion a year.
For many countries, tackling obesity will require a national – if not global – effort.
Only a coherent, sustained portfolio of initiatives, implemented on a large scale, will be effective.
No single entity – government, retailers, consumer-goods companies, restaurants, employers, media organizations, educators, health-care providers, or individuals – can address obesity on its own.
We do not yet have all the answers when it comes to the best way to tackle obesity.
But the rapid rise in obesity rates around the world creates a strong case for experimenting with interventions, to see what works.
Today, investment in obesity research worldwide amounts to some $4 billion a year – just 0.2% of the estimated social costs of obesity.
We can – and must – do more.
Global Risk and Reward in 2011
NEW YORK – The outlook for the global economy in 2011 is, partly, for a persistence of the trends established in 2010. These are: an anemic, below-trend, U-shaped recovery in advanced economies, as firms and households continue to repair their balance sheets; a stronger, V-shaped recovery in emerging-market countries, owing to stronger macroeconomic, financial, and policy fundamentals.
That adds up to close to 4% annual growth for the global economy, with advanced economies growing at around 2% and emerging-market countries growing at about 6%.
But there are downside and upside risks to this scenario.
On the downside, one of the most important risks is further financial contagion in Europe if the eurozone’s problems spread – as seems likely – to Portugal, Spain, and Belgium.
Given the current level of official resources at the disposal of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, Spain now seems too big to fail yet too big to be bailed out.
The United States represents another downside risk for global growth.
In 2011, the US faces a likely double dip in the housing market, high unemployment and weak job creation, a persistent credit crunch, gaping budgetary holes at the state and local level, and steeper borrowing costs as a result of the federal government’s lack of fiscal consolidation.
Moreover, credit growth on both sides of the Atlantic will be restrained, as many financial institutions in the US and Europe maintain a risk-averse stance toward lending.
In China and other emerging-market economies, delays in policy tightening could fuel a rise in inflation that forces a tougher clampdown later, with China, in particular, risking a hard landing.
There is also a risk that capital inflows to emerging markets will be mismanaged, thus fueling credit and asset bubbles.
Moreover, further increases in oil, energy, and commodity prices could lead to negative terms of trade and a reduction in real disposable income in net commodity-importing countries, while adding to inflationary pressures in emerging markets.
Moreover, currency tensions will remain high.
Countries with large current-account deficits need nominal and real depreciation (to sustain growth via net exports while ongoing private- and public-sector deleveraging keeps domestic demand weak), whereas surplus countries (especially emerging markets) are using currency intervention to resist nominal appreciation and sterilized intervention to combat real appreciation.
This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation – and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults.
Furthermore, several major geopolitical risks loom, including military confrontation between North and South Korea and the lingering possibility that Israel – or even the US – might use military force to counter Iran’s nuclear weapons program. There are also the political and economic turmoil in Pakistan and the risk of a rise in cyber-attacks – for example, in retaliation for criminal proceedings against WikiLeaks.
In the US, slower private-sector deleveraging – given the fiscal stimulus from the extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months, the payroll-tax cut, and maintenance of current income-tax rates for another two years – could lull policymakers into assuming that relatively large fiscal and current-account imbalances can continue indefinitely.
This could generate financial strains over the medium term – and protectionist pressures in the short term.
Finally, in the face of political opposition to fiscal consolidation, especially in the US, there is a risk that the path of least resistance becomes continued monetization of fiscal deficits.
Eventually (once the slack in goods and labor markets is reduced), this would push inflation expectations – and yield curves – higher.
But there are also several upside risks.
The US corporate sector is strong and very profitable, owing to massive labor shedding, creating scope for increased capital spending and hiring to contribute to more robust and above-trend GDP growth in 2011.
Similarly, the eurozone, driven by Germany, could lurch toward greater economic and political union (especially some form of fiscal union), thus containing the problems of its periphery.
Meanwhile, growth in Germany and the eurozone “core” may further accelerate given the strength of emerging markets, which may show even greater resilience, underpinning more rapid global expansion.
The attenuation of downside risks and pleasant surprises in developed and emerging economies could lead to a further increase in demand for risky assets (equities and credit), which would reinforce economic recovery via wealth effects and lower borrowing costs.
Positive feedback from consumption to production, employment, and income generation – both within countries and across countries via trade channels – could further accelerate the pace of global growth, particularly if monetary policies in most advanced economies remain looser than expected, supporting asset reflation and thus demand and growth.
Indeed, after four years (2007-2010) of either recession or sub-par recovery, the process of balance-sheet repair – while not completed yet – is underway, and may result in less saving and more spending to boost growth in advanced economies.
The damage from the financial crisis is still ongoing, but stronger growth can heal many wounds, especially debt-driven wounds.
So far, the downside and upside risks for the world economy are balanced.
But if sound government policies in advanced and major emerging economies contain the downside risks that are more prevalent in the first half of this year – which derive from political and policy uncertainty – a more resilient global economic recovery could take hold in the second half of 2011 and into 2012.
Technology and the Employment Challenge
MILAN – New technologies of various kinds, together with globalization, are powerfully affecting the range of employment options for individuals in advanced and developing countries alike – and at various levels of education.
Technological innovations are not only reducing the number of routine jobs, but also causing changes in global supply chains and networks that result in the relocation of routine jobs – and, increasingly, non-routine jobs at multiple skill levels – in the tradable sector of many economies.
How, then, should policymakers confront the new and difficult challenges for employment (and, in turn, for the distribution of income and wealth), especially in developed economies?
From recent research, we have learned a number of interesting things about how the evolution of economic structure affects employment.
The tradable side of advanced economies has not generated any real net increases in employment for at least two decades, while the jobs that it has created are concentrated in the upper-income and upper-education ranges, with employment declining in the middle and lower range of income and education.
Growth in high-end services employment is matched by contraction in high-employment components of manufacturing supply chains.
Until the crisis of 2008, middle- and lower-income job growth occurred entirely in the non-tradable sector of the economy, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of advanced countries’ output and employment.
Here, incomes and value added per employee remained largely flat.
Jobs could be eliminated by technology, but not by global competition; and, unsustainable, debt-fueled domestic-demand growth helped to delay the current employment deficits.
As a result, the advanced economies have been shedding routine jobs at a rapid rate, while adding non-routine jobs (for example, those that cannot yet be replaced or reduced by machines and networked computers).
This has fueled a dramatic rise in the return on education and high-level skills, with the share of total income received by owners of capital and high-end employees increasing in advanced countries for more than two decades.
Growth and employment are thus diverging in advanced countries.
The key force driving this trend – technology – is playing multiple roles.
The replacement of routine manual jobs by machines and robots is a powerful, continuing, and perhaps accelerating trend in manufacturing and logistics, while networks of computers are replacing routine white-collar jobs in information processing.
Part of this is pure automation.
Another important part is disintermediation – the elimination of intermediaries in banking, online retail, and a host of government services, to name just a few affected areas.
But technology’s impact does not stop there.
The same class of information technologies that automate, disintermediate, and reduce the costs of remoteness are also enabling the construction of increasingly complex and geographically diverse global supply chains and networks.
Global supply chains – constantly in flux, owing to rising developing-country incomes and shifting comparative advantage – locate productive activities where human and other resources make those activities competitive.
Links in these chains include not only intermediate products and assembly, but also a growing range of services – research and development, design, maintenance and support, customer service, business processes, and more – as transaction, coordination, and communication costs fall.
The result is what is sometimes called the “atomization” of global supply chains: increasingly fine subdivisions are feasible, more efficient, and locatable almost anywhere.
Proximity still matters in terms of transport and logistics costs.
But, with the developing world accounting for the largest new markets and most of the growth in global demand, the logic driving atomization should become even more compelling.
The efficient ongoing decomposition of global supply chains, networks, and services has two related consequences.
First, the tradable part of the global economy – where competition for economic activity and jobs is direct – is becoming a larger share of the whole; the same is true of individual economies.
Second, parts of global supply chains that were not competitive are no longer protected by being adjacent to parts that were.
Adjacency is no longer a requirement.
These dynamics and related challenges are not confined to advanced countries.
Over the next decade, for example, China will replace much of its labor-intensive assembly employment with higher-value-added employment in manufacturing and services, not only in the tradable sector, but also – even more noticeably – in the rapidly growing non-tradable part of its economy.
The expanding scope and diminishing costs of automation and additive manufacturing may affect labor-intensive functions globally, including in earlier-stage developing countries.
A key factor in adapting to these forces is investment.
For individuals, businesses, educational institutions, and governments in advanced countries, broad-based, elevated, and efficient investment in education and skills is critical.
Closing wide information gaps in the market for skills would also increase the efficiency of these investments.
Across-the-board upgrading of human capital will improve income distribution both directly and indirectly (by reducing the supply of lower-skill workers relative to demand).
It will also (partly) mitigate the concentration of wealth that results from a highly skewed income distribution.
On the tradable side, competitiveness depends not only on human capital, but also on a host of other factors: infrastructure, tax systems, regulatory efficiency, policy-induced uncertainty, and energy and health-care costs.
There is no guarantee that taking the right steps in these areas would entirely overcome the employment challenges that individuals and countries face, though doing so would help.
In fact, it is possible that we are entering a period in which major adaptations in employment models, work weeks, contract labor, minimum wages, and the delivery of essential public services will be needed in order to maintain social cohesion and uphold the core values of equity and intergenerational mobility.
Where Has Global Warming Gone?
SEATTLE – For the last quarter of the twentieth century, the average temperature at the surface of the earth edged inexorably upward.
Then, to the surprise even of scientists, it stopped.
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere continued to rise; indeed, it is higher today than it has been for centuries.
And yet, for the last 15 years, according to the conventional way of measuring global warming, the planet does not seem to have become any hotter.
What explains this unexpected turn of events, and what does it mean for future climate policy?
The pause in the rise of surface temperatures is real.
It can be observed in surveys of the surface of the sea and in satellite measurements of the troposphere.
But the reason it has occurred is not that our greenhouse-gas emissions are no longer changing the earth’s climate; it is that surface temperature is a poor metric for human-induced warming.
Indeed, what scientists have figured out is that, instead of warming the surface, the excess heat that is being generated has gone to the deeper oceans.
This calls into question some of the international strategies for combating climate change that are currently being negotiated, such as those aimed at preventing the global temperature at the earth’s surface from rising more than 2º Celsius above the pre-industrial average.
Scientists probably did not adequately convey to the public that their projections for future warming are based on models that account only for the so-called “forced response” in global mean surface temperatures – that is, the change caused by greenhouse-gas emissions.
But what is observed at the surface includes unforced, or natural, variations, such as the El Niño and La Niña fluctuations from year to year, and the 60-70 year cycle from the fluctuations of the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt in the Atlantic.
In fact, this cycle is now thought to bury heat deep in the oceans periodically.
And, because it existed even before humans put significant carbon into the atmosphere, it is likely natural.
Given the oceans’ massive heat-storage capacity, determining how much of the warming remains at the surface over the course of decades is a very difficult task.
Though the challenge is beginning to be appreciated, current projections of the dreaded two-degree warming have yet to take into account variable ocean cycles.
To be sure, surface temperatures remain important.
They are a better measure of the threats posed by climate change than heat sequestered underwater.
But some of the threats that scientists (and economists) deduce from the surface temperature also reflect natural climate change, and thus cannot be mitigated through the reduction of CO2 emissions.
The total amount of heat contained in oceans responds to changes in emissions, and is therefore a better metric for measuring such responses.
Indeed, it has continued to warm as expected, even as the surface temperature has stopped rising.
The oceans’ heat content is measured by a network of more than 3,000 free-drifting robotic floats spread out across the world’s waters, where they routinely dive 2,000 meters beneath the surface.
The temperature they measure is transmitted to orbiting satellites and made available online to anyone in near-real time.
For ease of interpretation, the oceans’ heat content can easily be converted to a mean temperature after dividing by a constant.
In time, models could demonstrate how to relate this new global metric to emissions’ regional climate impact.
The intensive scientific search for an explanation for the pause in global warming at the earth’s surface has led to a better understanding of the complex functioning of the climate.
It confirms the long-held theory that the earth has an energy budget that is affected by radiative perturbations at the top of the atmosphere, though partitioning that energy between the surface and the deeper oceans has been difficult.
Nobody knows how long the current pause will last.
Nonetheless, at some point, the natural cycles will shift; the oceans will cease to absorb the bulk of the planet’s warming; and surface temperatures will begin to climb again.
When they do, we can expect the increase to resume the rapid pace observed during the late twentieth century, when surface temperature rose by about 0.17 degrees Celsius every ten years.
In the meantime, whether the overall risk to our environment has been reduced by the pause remains an open question.
Some argue that what went down will eventually come back up.
The sloshing back and forth of warm and cold waters – El Niño and La Niña – in the shallow layer of the equatorial Pacific Ocean will continue to produce fluctuations in surface temperatures every year.
Over longer periods, however, the risk that the heat currently stored in the deep ocean will resurface is remote.
One thing is clear.
Monitoring surface temperatures does not give us an accurate enough representation of human-induced global warming.
As long as we lack a clear understanding of the relationship between our cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions and the temperature of the earth, it will remain difficult to assess the potential for damage related to climate change caused by humans – or develop the right strategies to minimize it.
The Post-Crisis Crises
NEW YORK – In the shadow of the euro crisis and America’s fiscal cliff, it is easy to ignore the global economy’s long-term problems.
But, while we focus on immediate concerns, they continue to fester, and we overlook them at our peril.
The most serious is global warming.
While the global economy’s weak performance has led to a corresponding slowdown in the increase in carbon emissions, it amounts to only a short respite.
And we are far behind the curve: Because we have been so slow to respond to climate change, achieving the targeted limit of a two-degree (centigrade) rise in global temperature, will require sharp reductions in emissions in the future.
Some suggest that, given the economic slowdown, we should put global warming on the backburner.
On the contrary, retrofitting the global economy for climate change would help to restore aggregate demand and growth.
At the same time, the pace of technological progress and globalization necessitates rapid structural changes in both developed and developing countries alike.
Such changes can be traumatic, and markets often do not handle them well.
Just as the Great Depression arose in part from the difficulties in moving from a rural, agrarian economy to an urban, manufacturing one, so today’s problems arise partly from the need to move from manufacturing to services.
New firms must be created, and modern financial markets are better at speculation and exploitation than they are at providing funds for new enterprises, especially small and medium-size companies.
Moreover, making the transition requires investments in human capital that individuals often cannot afford.
Among the services that people want are health and education, two sectors in which government naturally plays an important role (owing to inherent market imperfections in these sectors and concerns about equity).
Before the 2008 crisis, there was much talk of global imbalances, and the need for the trade-surplus countries, like Germany and China, to increase their consumption.
That issue has not gone away; indeed, Germany’s failure to address its chronic external surplus is part and parcel of the euro crisis.
China’s surplus, as a percentage of GDP, has fallen, but the long-term implications have yet to play out.
America’s overall trade deficit will not disappear without an increase in domestic savings and a more fundamental change in global monetary arrangements.
The former would exacerbate the country’s slowdown, and neither change is in the cards.
As China increases its consumption, it will not necessarily buy more goods from the United States.
In fact, it is more likely to increase consumption of non-traded goods – like health care and education – resulting in profound disturbances to the global supply chain, especially in countries that had been supplying the inputs to China’s manufacturing exporters.
Finally, there is a worldwide crisis in inequality.
The problem is not only that the top income groups are getting a larger share of the economic pie, but also that those in the middle are not sharing in economic growth, while in many countries poverty is increasing.
In the US, equality of opportunity has been exposed as a myth.
While the Great Recession has exacerbated these trends, they were apparent long before its onset.
Indeed, I (and others) have argued that growing inequality is one of the reasons for the economic slowdown, and is partly a consequence of the global economy’s deep, ongoing structural changes.
An economic and political system that does not deliver for most citizens is one that is not sustainable in the long run.
Eventually, faith in democracy and the market economy will erode, and the legitimacy of existing institutions and arrangements will be called into question.
The good news is that the gap between the emerging and advanced countries has narrowed greatly in the last three decades.
Nonetheless, hundreds of millions of people remain in poverty, and there has been only a little progress in reducing the gap between the least developed countries and the rest.
Here, unfair trade agreements – including the persistence of unjustifiable agricultural subsidies, which depress the prices upon which the income of many of the poorest depend – have played a role.
The developed countries have not lived up to their promise in Doha in November 2001 to create a pro-development trade regime, or to their pledge at the G-8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to provide significantly more assistance to the poorest countries.
The market will not, on its own, solve any of these problems.
Global warming is a quintessential “public goods” problem.
To make the structural transitions that the world needs, we need governments to take a more active role – at a time when demands for cutbacks are increasing in Europe and the US.
As we struggle with today’s crises, we should be asking whether we are responding in ways that exacerbate our long-term problems.
The path marked out by the deficit hawks and austerity advocates both weakens the economy today and undermines future prospects.
The irony is that, with insufficient aggregate demand the major source of global weakness today, there is an alternative: invest in our future, in ways that help us to address simultaneously the problems of global warming, global inequality and poverty, and the necessity of structural change.
Global Warming’s Cheap, Effective Solution
COPENHAGEN – Global warming will mean that more people die from the heat.
There will be a rise in sea levels, more malaria, starvation, and poverty.
Concern has been great, but humanity has done very little that will actually prevent these outcomes.
Carbon emissions have kept increasing, despite repeated promises of cuts.
We all have a stake in ensuring that climate change is stopped.
We turned to climate scientists to inform us about the problem of global warming.
Now we need to turn to climate economists to enlighten us about the benefits, costs, and possible outcomes from different responses to this challenge.
World leaders are meeting in Copenhagen this December to forge a new pact to tackle global warming.
Should they continue with plans to make carbon-cutting promises that are unlikely to be fulfilled?
Should they instead delay reductions for 20 years?
What could be achieved by planting more trees, cutting methane, or reducing black soot emissions?
Is it sensible to focus on a technological solution to warming?
Or should we just adapt to a warmer world?
Much of the current policy debate remains focused on cutting carbon, but there are many ways to go about repairing the global climate.
Our choices will result in different outcomes and different costs.
The optimal combination of solutions will create the biggest impact for the least money.
A groundbreaking paper by economists Eric Bickel and Lee Lane is one of the first – and certainly the most comprehensive – study of the costs and benefits of climate engineering.
Deliberately manipulating the earth’s climate seems like something from science fiction. But as President Barack Obama’s science adviser, John Holdren, has said it has “got to be looked at,” and many prominent scientists agree.
Bickel and Lane offer compelling evidence that a tiny investment in climate engineering might be able to reduce as much of global warming’s effects as trillions of dollars spent on carbon emission reductions.
Climate engineering has the advantage of speed.
There is a significant delay between carbon cuts and any temperature drop – even halving global emissions by mid-century would barely be measurable by the end of the century.
Making green energy cheap and prevalent will also take a long time. Consider that electrification of the global economy is still incomplete after more than a century of effort.
Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed.
Solar radiation management appears to be one of the most hopeful.
Atmospheric greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through but absorb heat and radiate some down to the earth’s surface.
All else being equal, higher concentrations will warm the planet.
Solar radiation management would bounce a little sunlight back into space.
Reflecting just 1-2% of the total sunlight that strikes the earth could offset as much warming as that caused by doubling preindustrial levels of greenhouse gases.
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about a million tons of sulfur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere, reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe, and – by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight – cooled the earth’s surface for almost two years.
We could mimic this effect through stratospheric aerosol insertion – essentially launching material like sulfur dioxide or soot into the stratosphere.
Another promising approach is marine cloud whitening, which sprays seawater droplets into marine clouds to make them reflect more sunlight.
This augments the natural process, where sea salt from the oceans provides water vapor with the cloud condensation nuclei.
It is remarkable to consider that we could cancel out this century’s global warming with 1,900 unmanned ships spraying seawater mist into the air to thicken clouds.
The total cost would be about $9 billion, and the benefits of preventing the temperature increase would add up to about $20 trillion.
That is the equivalent of doing about $2000 worth of good with every dollar spent.
Many of the risks of climate engineering have been overstated.
Marine cloud whitening would not lead to permanent atmospheric changes, and could be used only when needed.
Turning seawater into clouds is a natural process.
The biggest challenge is public perception.
Many environmental lobbyists oppose even researching climate engineering.
This is startling, given the manifold benefits.
If we care most about avoiding warmer temperatures, it seems that we should be elated that this simple, cost-effective approach shows so much promise.
Climate engineering could remain a back-up option in case of necessity. Or we could put it on the agenda today.
In either case, there is a commanding case for its serious consideration.
We are on track to being the generation that wasted decades bickering over carbon-emission cuts and failed to stop the harmful effects of warming.
That would be a shameful legacy – one that could be avoided by re-thinking climate policy.
Global Warming’s Dirty Secret
Last week, the European Union declared that it had practically saved the planet.
With European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso claiming that Europe will lead the way on climate change, the EU has promised to cut CO2 emissions by 20% below 1990-levels by 2020.
Of course, with the EU already having promised an 8% cut by next year in the Kyoto Protocol, this new target seems slightly less ambitious.
Moreover, in continuing the fundamental problems besetting the crippled Kyoto Protocol, the EU has essentially gone and made a worse deal.
Man-made climate change is, of course, real, and constitutes a serious problem.
Yet the current cut-emissions-now-before-it-is-too-late mindset neglects the fact that the world has no sensible short-term solutions.
This seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol, whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious, environmentally inconsequential, and inordinately expensive.
It required such big reductions that only few countries could live up to it.
Some countries, like the United States and Australia, chose to opt out of its stringent demands; others, like Canada, Japan, and a raft of European states, pay lip service to its requirements but will essentially miss its targets.
Yet, even if everyone had participated and continued to stick to Kyoto’s ever more stringent commitments, it would have had virtually no environmental effect.
The treaty’s effect on temperature would be immeasurable by mid-century and only postpone warming by five years in 2100.
Nonetheless, the cost would have been anything but trivial – an estimated $180 billion per year.
With its high-pitched rhetoric, you would be forgiven for believing that the EU has now single-handedly taken the major step towards solving the problem.
Barroso calls the agreement “historic,” Tony Blair extols its “groundbreaking, bold, ambitious targets,” and German Chancellor Angela Merkel even ventured that the promises “can avoid what could well be a human calamity.”
But nobody sees fit to reveal the agreement’s dirty little secret: it will do next to no good, and again at very high cost.
According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model, the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20% will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years, yet the cost will be about $90 billion annually.
It will be costly, because Europe is a costly place to cut CO2, and it will be inconsequential, because the EU will account for only about 6% of all emissions in the twenty-first century.
So the new treaty will be an even less efficient use of our resources than the old Kyoto Protocol.
It is important to learn from the past.
We have often been promised dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions far into the future, only to see the promises vanish when we got there.
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the West promised to stabilize emissions, but overshot by 12%.
In Kyoto, we were promised a 7% reduction in world emissions, but will probably achieve only 0.4%.
Of course, those promises were made by politicians who in all likelihood will no longer be in office when the time comes to fulfil them.
We will not be able to solve global warming over the next decades, but only the next half or full century.
We need to find a viable, long-term strategy that is smart, equitable, and doesn’t require inordinate sacrifice for trivial benefits.
Fortunately, there is such a strategy: research and development.
Investing in R&amp;D of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies would leave future generations able to make serious and yet economically feasible and advantageous cuts.
A new global warming treaty should mandate spending 0.05% of GDP on R&amp;D in the future.
It would be much cheaper, yet do much more good in the long run.
The EU’s new global warming agreement may help win elections for leaders faced with voters scared by the prospect of climate change.
But it will do virtually no good, at high cost, and – as with many other lofty promises from the EU – it will carry a high probability of failure.
Let us hope that the rest of the world will keep its cool and propose a better, cheaper, and more effective solution for the future.
Global Warming’s Misunderstood Victims
BAMAKO, MALI – Media organizations in wealthy countries regularly send forth reporters to find “victims of global warming.”
In dispatches from the Pacific Islands, Bangladesh, or Ethiopia, journalists warn of impending calamity.
Global warming is the most horrific challenge facing these regions, we are told. Its resolution is vital.
But seldom do we hear from the local people who are said to be in danger.
These people are not voiceless; we just pay no attention to what they say.
The Copenhagen Consensus Center set out to ask people in global-warming hot spots about their fears and hopes.
In Mojo, central Ethiopia, our researchers met Tadese Denkue, a 68-year-old former soldier with no regular income.
“I never know when I will be able to buy myself some food,” he said.
“I only know that I suffer a lot.
This is not a decent life.”
Tadese has never heard of global warming.
When it is explained to him, he is dismissive.
He has more immediate concerns: “The first thing I need is food, and then a job.”
Tadese is suffering from his second bout of malaria this year. He has lost count of how many times he has contracted the disease.
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic. The electricity is not working.
A doctor admits that most patients are sent home without testing or treatment: the clinic has run out of medicine.
The threat of more malaria has been used to argue for drastic carbon cuts.
Warmer, wetter weather will improve conditions for the malaria parasite.
Most estimates suggest that global warming will put 3% more of the earth’s population at risk of catching malaria by 2100.
The most efficient, global carbon cuts – designed to keep temperature increases under two degrees Celsius – would cost $40 trillion a year by 2100, according to research by Richard Tol for the Copenhagen Consensus Center.
In the best-case scenario, this expenditure would reduce the at-risk population by only 3%.
In comparison, spending $3 billion annually on mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective new combination therapies could halve the total number of those infected within one decade.
For the money it takes to save one life with carbon cuts, smarter policies could save 78,000 lives.
Of course, malaria is far from the only reason we worry about global warming.
Twenty kilometers from Mojo, our researcher met Desi Koricho and her eight-month-old son, Michel.
Every two weeks, Desi walks four hours to take Michel to the health center.
After two months of malnutrition treatment, Michel has grown a lot but remains half the normal size of a baby his age.
Michel is not Desi’s biological child.
She took him in after his father committed suicide and he was abandoned.
Desi likely suffers from undiagnosed malnutrition herself.
It is rife here.
There are no roads, electricity, or other infrastructure. Conditions are cramped and unhygienic.
“We need everything,” Desi says.
Solving the malnutrition challenge would be a good start.
Campaigners across Europe and the US use the threat of starvation to argue for drastic carbon cuts.
For most regions, weather changes will increase agricultural productivity.
Cruelly, this is not the case for parts of Africa that are already suffering from hunger.
But, as with malaria, all of the evidence shows that direct policies are much more effective than carbon cuts.
One effective, under-appreciated intervention is providing micro-nutrients to those who lack them.
Providing Vitamin A and zinc to 80% of the 140 million or so undernourished children in the world would require a commitment of just $60 million annually.
For $286 million, we could get iron and iodine to more than 2.5 billion people.
The choice is stark: for a few hundred million dollars, we could help almost half of humanity now.
Compare this to the investments to tackle climate change – $40 trillion annually by the end of the century – which would save a hundred times fewer starving people (and in 90 years!).
For every person saved from malnutrition through climate policies, the same money could have saved half a million people from micronutrient malnutrition through direct policies.
Some argue that the choice between spending money on carbon cuts and on direct policies is unfair.
But it is a basic fact that no dollar can be spent twice.
Rich countries and donors have limited budgets and attention spans.
If we spend vast amounts of money on carbon cuts in the mistaken belief that we are stopping malaria and reducing malnutrition, we are less likely to put aside money for the direct policies that would help today.
Indeed, for every dollar spent on strong climate policies, we will likely do about $0.02 of good for the future.
If we spent the same dollar on simple policies to help malnutrition or malaria now, we could do $20 or more good – 1000 times better, when all impacts are taken into account.
On Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania – where the effects of global warming can already be felt – our researcher encountered 28-year-old Rehema Ibrahim.
Rehema was divorced by her husband and disowned by her family after she failed to produce children.
To find out if she was the cause of the infertility, she started sleeping with other men.
She is now HIV-positive, an outcast in a terribly poor society.
Rehema has noticed changes in the weather.
She says that the snow and ice have been melting. She knows what our researcher means by “global warming.”
But, she says: “The issues I am experiencing have greater priority.
The HIV and the problems it is causing are greater than the [receding] ice.”
Campaigners for carbon-emission reductions regularly highlight the melting snow and ice of Mount Kilimanjaro.
But we need to pay as much attention to the people living in the mountain’s shadow.
Global Warming’s Technology Deficit
COPENHAGEN – Our current approach to solving global warming will not work.
It is flawed economically, because carbon taxes will cost a fortune and do little, and it is flawed politically, because negotiations to reduce CO2 emissions will become ever more fraught and divisive.
And even if you disagree on both counts, the current approach is also flawed technologically.
Many countries are now setting ambitious carbon-cutting goals ahead of global negotiations in Copenhagen this December to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
Let us imagine that the world ultimately agrees on an ambitious target.
Say we decide to reduce CO2 emissions by three-quarters by 2100 while maintaining reasonable growth.
Herein lies the technological problem: to meet this goal, non-carbon-based sources of energy would have to be an astounding 2.5 times greater in 2100 than the level of total global energy consumption was in 2000.
These figures were calculated by economists Chris Green and Isabel Galiana of McGill University.
Their research shows that confronting global warming effectively requires nothing short of a technological revolution.
We are not taking this challenge seriously.
If we continue on our current path, technological development will be nowhere near significant enough to make non-carbon-based energy sources competitive with fossil fuels on price and effectiveness.
In Copenhagen this December, the focus will be on how much carbon to cut, rather than on how to do so.
Little or no consideration will be given to whether the means of cutting emissions are sufficient to achieve the goals.
Politicians will base their decisions on global warming models that simply assume that technological breakthroughs will happen by themselves.
This faith is sadly – and dangerously – misplaced.
Green and Galiana examine the state of non-carbon-based energy today – nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, etc. – and find that, taken together, alternative energy sources would get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way toward stabilization by 2100.
We need many, many times more non-carbon-based energy than is currently produced.
Yet the needed technology will not be ready in terms of scalability or stability.
In many cases, there is still a need for the most basic research and development.
We are not even close to getting this revolution started.
Current technology is so inefficient that – to take just one example – if we were serious about wind power, we would have to blanket most countries with wind turbines to generate enough energy for everybody, and we would still have the massive problem of storage: we don’t know what to do when the wind doesn’t blow.
Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations, and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be.
Not only would this have a much greater chance of actually addressing climate change, but it would also have a much greater chance of political success.
The biggest emitters of the twenty-first century, including India and China, are unwilling to sign up to tough, costly emission targets.
They would be much more likely to embrace a cheaper, smarter, and more beneficial path of innovation.
Today’s politicians focus narrowly on how high a carbon tax should be to stop people from using fossil fuels.
That is the wrong question.
The market alone is an ineffective way to stimulate research and development into uncertain technology, and a high carbon tax will simply hurt growth if alternatives are not ready.
In other words, we will all be worse off.
Green and Galiana propose limiting carbon pricing initially to a low tax (say, $5.00 a ton) to finance energy research and development.
Over time, they argue, the tax should be allowed to rise slowly to encourage the deployment of effective, affordable technology alternatives.
Investing about $100 billion annually in non-carbon-based energy research would mean that we could essentially fix climate change on the century scale.
Green and Galiana calculate the benefits – from reduced warming and greater prosperity – and conservatively conclude that for every dollar spent this approach would avoid about $11 of climate damage.
Compare this to other analyses showing that strong and immediate carbon cuts would be expensive, yet achieve as little as $0.02 of avoided climate damage.
If we continue implementing policies to reduce emissions in the short term without any focus on developing the technology to achieve this, there is only one possible outcome: virtually no climate impact, but a significant dent in global economic growth, with more people in poverty, and the planet in a worse place than it could be. 
Global Warnings
You know how you are told to give your kids organic food because pesticides will give them cancer?
Well, it’s technically true that there is a link between the chemicals and illness, but the risk is miniscule in any well-regulated country.
There is another threat that you haven’t been told much about.
One of the best ways to avoid cancer is to eat lots of fruit and vegetables.
Organic items are 10% or 20% more expensive than regular produce, so most of us naturally buy less when we “go organic.”
If you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down.
Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
My intention isn’t to scare people away from organic food.
But we should hear both sides of any story.
Consider a tale that has made the covers of some of the world’s biggest magazines and newspapers: the plight of the polar bear.
We are told that global warming will wipe out this majestic creature.
We are not told, however, that over the past 40 years – while temperatures have risen – the global polar bear population has increased from 5,000 to 25,000.
Campaigners and the media claim that we should cut our CO2 emissions to save the polar bear.
Well, then, let’s do the math.
Let’s imagine that every country in the world – including the United States and Australia – were to sign the Kyoto Protocol and cut its CO2 emissions for the rest of this century.
Looking at the best-studied polar bear population of 1,000 bears, in the West Hudson Bay, how many polar bears would we save in a year?
Ten?
Twenty?
A hundred?
Actually, we would save less than one-tenth of a polar bear.
If we really do care about saving polar bears, we could do something much simpler and more effective: ban hunting them.
Each year, 49 bears are shot in the West Hudson Bay alone.
So why don’t we stop killing 49 bears a year before we commit trillions of dollars to do hundreds of times less good?
From the promotion of organic food to declarations of the polar bear’s imminent demise, the media pelt us with a constant barrage of one-sided warnings.
The list of urgent concerns is topped by global warming, but also includes terrorism, pesticides, and the loss of biodiversity – and seems to have virtually no end.
All the while, we know of the terrible conditions that still face the majority of the world’s population, with more than a billion poor, two billion without electricity, and three billion without clean drinking water and sanitation.
Much of my work is to make sense of all these global warnings.
I try to put them in perspective and figure out which ones really should concern us, and when we should act on them.
Perhaps surprisingly, not everything of concern should be dealt with immediately.
If we don’t have a good way to fix a problem, it might be better to focus on something else first.
After all, when you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, it’s hard to worry about what global temperatures will be 100 years from now.
Things have improved immensely in both the developing and developed worlds.
In the last 100 years, scientists have won many of the most important battles against infectious diseases, to the extent that poverty is now the main reason for a lack of treatment.
Global average life expectancy in 1900 was 30 years; today, it is 68 years.
Food has become more plentiful and affordable, especially in the developing world, where calorie availability has increased by 40% per person over the past 40 years, while food prices have more than halved.
Consequently, the proportion of hungry in the Third World has dropped from 50% in 1950 to less than 17% today, while worldwide incomes have increased more than three-fold.
Perhaps most importantly, all of these positive trends are expected to continue.
The United Nations estimates that average life expectancy will reach 75 years by the middle of the century, and that the proportion of those going hungry will drop below 4%.
By the close of the century, incomes will have increased six-fold in industrialized countries and 12-fold in developing countries, making the average person in the developing world richer in 2100 than the average American or European is today.
The number of poor will drop from a billion to less than five million.
None of this means we should stop worrying about the future.
But it does mean that we can quit panicking and start thinking calmly to ensure that we focus on the right issues.
Global alarm bells might cause pangs of guilt for wealthy Westerners, but they don’t give us an adequate understanding of what’s going on.
We all need to hear both sides of the story.
GMOs and Junk Science
STANFORD – In today’s media landscape, where unfounded opinions, hype, and rumors are rife, the scientific method – the means by which we determine, based on empirical and measurable evidence, what is true – should serve as a touchstone of reality.
Science enables us to gauge what we think we know and to identify what we do not.
Most important, it discredits false claims made for personal or political reasons – at least it should.
But scientists occasionally “go rogue,” forsaking the scientific method – often for notoriety or economic gain – to produce propaganda and to sow fear in a public that lacks expertise but is hungry for information.
This abuse of scientific authority is especially widespread in the “organic” and “natural” food industries, which capitalize on people’s fear of synthetic or “unnatural” products.
A recent example is the Indian-American scientist V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, who, with Prabhakar Deonikar, published the much-ridiculed paper “Do GMOs Accumulate Formaldehyde and Disrupt Molecular Systems Equilibria?
Systems Biology May Provide Answers.”
(“GMOs” are “genetically modified organisms,” itself a misleading and often unfairly stigmatized non-category, circumscribing a universe of organisms modified with the most modern and precise techniques of genetic engineering.)
Although the article supposedly passed the peer-review process, a key component of legitimate science, it appeared in a low-impact “pay-for-play” journal, Agricultural Sciences, which is produced by a “predatory” publisher.
Within days of publication, anti-biotechnology organizations like the Organic Consumers Association and GMO Inside were reporting on Ayyadurai’s “findings” with frightening headlines – “Formaldehyde in GMO Soy?” and “New Study Shows GMO Soy Accumulates Cancer Causing Chemical Formaldehyde” – accompanied by scary graphics.
But the problems with Ayyadurai’s paper are legion.
Its title alone is enough to show that something is amiss.
If you think that GMOs might “accumulate formaldehyde” – a chemical that is probably carcinogenic at high levels but is present in most living cells and found widely in our environment – the obvious response would be to measure its levels in the organisms.
Ayyadurai, however, chose to make guesses based on modeling via “systems biology.”
“Systems biology” enables only a prediction, not an experimental conclusion.
Rather than actually testing the levels of any chemicals in plants, Ayyadurai plugged data into a computer algorithm to predict the levels of two chemicals, formaldehyde and glutathione.
This is akin to a meteorologist predicting from his models that it will be sunny all day, instead of looking out the window to see whether rain is falling.
To be sure, as Kevin Folta, the head of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, explained, systems biology can be a useful approach if employed properly.
As he put it, systems biology “is a way to make predictions based on integrating existing data, and then statistically deriving a likelihood that the predictions may be correct.”
But, he emphasizes, the predictions are then to be tested, “and the systems approach validated.”
Like all predictive studies based on computer modeling, the validity of the results depends on the integrity of the data and the algorithm.
If the data are cherry-picked to support the modeler’s desired conclusions, or if the algorithm is flawed, the results will be inaccurate.
But it is unclear from Ayyadurai’s article which data were used, and there is no validation of the model.
Folta offers a brilliant send-up of Ayyadurai’s work.
“If you developed a computer program that integrated Internet data to predict the location of Munich, and the program told you it was squarely in the Gulf of Mexico, right off Florida, it does not mean that Munich is in the Gulf of Mexico, right off of Florida.”
Instead, it means that you have made a mistake, in your program, assumptions, or input data – all of which are testable.
To decide not to challenge those data, Folta continues, and instead to “publish a map showing that Munich is squarely in the Gulf of Mexico, opposing all other data and the claims of millions of rather dry Germans, does not mean that you are brilliant.
It means you have absolutely no clue, or more likely, have some reason you want a major German metropolis to be a two-hour boat ride from Tampa.”
Folta also has something to say about Ayyadurai’s publisher.
If you print the deceptive map showing the location of Munich, “what does that say about your integrity as a reliable information source?”
In the spirit of scientific cooperation, Folta offered to collaborate with Ayyadurai on university-based testing of genetically engineered corn and soy samples (along with appropriate controls), with analysis by an independent lab.
Ayyadurai declined, so Folta will proceed himself.
The experimental data is forthcoming.
In the meantime, if you get a hankering for sauerbraten and spaetzle, head for Central Europe, not the Gulf of Mexico.
Godless Morality
Is religion necessary for morality?
Many people consider it outrageous, even blasphemous, to deny the divine origin of morality.
Either some divine being crafted our moral sense, or we picked it up from the teachings of organized religion.
Either way, we need religion to curb nature’s vices.
Paraphrasing Katherine Hepburn in the movie The African Queen, religion allows us to rise above wicked old Mother Nature, handing us a moral compass.
Yet problems abound for the view that morality comes from God.
One problem is that we cannot, without lapsing into tautology, simultaneously say that God is good, and that he gave us our sense of good and bad.
For then we are simply saying that God meets God’s standards.
A second problem is that there are no moral principles that are shared by all religious people, regardless of their specific beliefs, but by no agnostics and atheists.
Indeed, atheists and agnostics do not behave less morally than religious believers, even if their virtuous acts rest on different principles.
Non-believers often have as strong and sound a sense of right and wrong as anyone, and have worked to abolish slavery and contributed to other efforts to alleviate human suffering.
The opposite is also true.
Religion has led people to commit a long litany of horrendous crimes, from God’s command to Moses to slaughter the Midianites – men, women, boys, and non-virginal girls – through the Crusades, the Inquisition, innumerable conflicts between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and suicide bombers convinced that martyrdom will lead them to paradise.
The third difficulty for the view that morality is rooted in religion is that some elements of morality seem to be universal, despite sharp doctrinal differences among the world’s major religions.
In fact, these elements extend even to cultures like China, where religion is less significant than philosophical outlooks like Confucianism.
Perhaps a divine creator handed us these universal elements at the moment of creation.
But an alternative explanation, consistent with the facts of biology and geology, is that over millions of years we have evolved a moral faculty that generates intuitions about right and wrong.
For the first time, research in the cognitive sciences, building on theoretical arguments emerging from moral philosophy, has made it possible to resolve the ancient dispute about the origin and nature of morality.
Consider the following three scenarios.
For each, fill in the blank space with “obligatory,” “permissible,” or “forbidden.”
1.
A runaway boxcar is about to run over five people walking on the tracks.
A railroad worker is standing next to a switch that can turn the boxcar onto a side track, killing one person, but allowing the five to survive.
Flipping the switch is ______.
2.
You pass by a small child drowning in a shallow pond, and you are the only one around.
If you pick up the child, she will survive and your pants will be ruined.
Picking up the child is _______.
3.
Five people have just been rushed into a hospital in critical condition, each requiring an organ to survive.
There is not enough time to request organs from outside the hospital, but there is a healthy person in the hospital’s waiting room.
If the surgeon takes this person’s organs, he will die, but the five in critical care will survive.
Taking the healthy person’s organs is _______.
If you judged case 1 as permissible, case 2 as obligatory, and case 3 as forbidden, then you are like the 1,500 subjects around the world who responded to these dilemmas on our web-based moral sense test (http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/).
If morality is God’s word, atheists should judge these cases differently from religious people, and their responses should rely on different justifications.
For example, because atheists supposedly lack a moral compass, they should be guided by pure self-interest and walk by the drowning child.
But there were no statistically significant differences between subjects with or without religious backgrounds, with approximately 90% of subjects saying that it is permissible to flip the switch on the boxcar, 97% saying that it is obligatory to rescue the baby, and 97% saying that is forbidden to remove the healthy man’s organs.
When asked to justify why some cases are permissible and others forbidden, subjects are either clueless or offer explanations that cannot account for the relevant differences.
Importantly, those with a religious background are as clueless or incoherent as atheists.
These studies provide empirical support for the idea that, like other psychological faculties of the mind, including language and mathematics, we are endowed with a moral faculty that guides our intuitive judgments of right and wrong.
These intuitions reflect the outcome of millions of years in which our ancestors have lived as social mammals, and are part of our common inheritance.
Our evolved intuitions do not necessarily give us the right or consistent answers to moral dilemmas.
What was good for our ancestors may not be good today.
But insights into the changing moral landscape, in which issues like animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, and international aid have come to the fore, have not come from religion, but from careful reflection on humanity and what we consider a life well lived.
In this respect, it is important for us to be aware of the universal set of moral intuitions so that we can reflect on them and, if we choose, act contrary to them.
We can do this without blasphemy, because it is our own nature, not God, that is the source of our morality.
Going “Soft” on Iran
BRUSSELS – 2010 will be a crucial and uncertain year for the Islamic Republic of Iran – and for its relations with the European Union.
The domestic hostility towards the regime that erupted in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections last June has not died away, but has become stronger and more determined.
The Ashura riots of last December and the violent suppression of protests during the recent anniversary to mark the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution were some of the fiercest to date.
The regime’s sharp crackdown ahead of the anniversary did not stop thousands from marching in the streets, despite the threat of swift retribution.
The likelihood of more arrests, trials, and bloodshed is a concern for many in the international community.
More ominously, following riots the regime put 16 opposition members on trial for taking part in the demonstrations, with prosecutors indicating that some would be charged with the offense of mohareb , or “making a war against God” – a capital crime.
The heavy-handed approach adopted by the regime is causing friction among even its loyalists.
A former member of Iran’s parliament, Javad Ettaat, argues that the “government is contravening the principles of Islam by using an iron fist against protesters.”
Mohammad Taghi Khalaji, a cleric and devoted follower of Ayatollah Khomeini, was arrested on January 12 after saying at a Tehran mosque that Iran’s leaders should repent for their actions.
Moreover, an Iranian diplomat in Oslo, Mohammed Reza Heydari, resigned in protest against the regime’s behavior after the December riots.
Other Iranian diplomats also are reportedly resigning from their posts and seeking asylum abroad.
The European Parliament has been paying close attention to the deteriorating situation in Iran.
There has been pressure to impose targeted sanctions aimed at impeding the financial operations of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which holds a virtual monopoly over strategic industries such as banking, defense and construction.
Many European companies have profited from investing in such firms, which means deciding on the terms of sanctions could prove cumbersome.
On the issue of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the Iranian government’s equivocal position also is a source of growing concern.
Many European lawmakers are worried by the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran on Europe’s doorstep, and are not convinced by the regime’s claim that it seeks only nuclear energy.
It is critical, therefore, that the EU demonstrate its commitment to the Iranian people through actions, rather than words – a complaint that many Iranians level against Western powers – by taking a tougher stance against the regime.
Targeted sanctions aimed at the Revolutionary Guard would be an important step, but so is clearly expressing solidarity with the millions of Iranian men and women who are fighting for a democratic and pluralist society.
Europe should stand with Iran's civil society, and the European Parliament has already paid tribute to the courage of all those Iranian men and women who are defending their basic freedoms and democratic principles.
A concrete demonstration of its commitment is the request to make better use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
Eighty MEPs, including the Parliament’s former president, Hans-Gert Pöttering, and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, are urging the Parliament to honor its commitment to human rights by remembering the life of Neda Agha Soltan, the young woman who was killed last June in Tehran while standing up for her rights.
We believe that the European Parliament should commemorate her sacrifice by hanging a poster of her image on the external wall of the Parliament’s premises in Brussels, beside the poster of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s democratic opposition.
Agha Soltan has become the symbol of the desire for freedom of a people that Europe must help.
This simple act could demonstrate the importance of Europe’s soft power, which frightens the Islamic Republic more than the threat of military force by keeping the media spotlight on the regime’s human rights record and emphasizing its growing isolation.
It would also foster stronger ties between Iran’s civil society and the outside world, while setting an example to the international community that the EU is committed to the principles enshrined in its own Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Europe’s policy for Iran is not regime change, but when human rights and democracy are at stake, we cannot simply close our eyes.
Going to the Dogs
GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA – There are about 70 million dogs living in human homes in the United States. That’s 10 million more dogs than children under the age of 15.
The pattern in other Western nations is similar.
Roughly 40% of house dogs are allowed to sleep on their owners’ beds. 
How did dogs achieve such an intimate position in our lives?
One theory is that, in the thousands of years that dogs have lived with humans, they have become attuned to human ways of thinking.
Certainly dogs have a remarkable sensitivity to human behavior.
Dogs are able to follow human pointing gestures to find hidden food, and they can indicate successfully to their owners by their own pointing actions where a hidden toy is located.
Under certain circumstances, dogs understand that a human who cannot see them (because, for example, she is blindfolded) is less likely to respond to begging with a tasty treat than a person whose vision is not obscured.
Dogs are also more likely to obey a command to leave something desirable alone if their master stays in the room than if he steps out.
And yet attempts to view canine smarts as cut from the same cloth as human intelligence gloss over a lot of the details about how dogs and humans operate.
Evolution doesn’t ever build the same form of intelligence twice – even though similar problems may lead to similar solutions.
As most owners of puppies know, it takes time and care for a dog to learn the ways of humans.
We don’t literally raise our hackles when angry, or sniff each other’s backsides when making new friends.
And dogs don’t gesture with their forepaws or use an elaborate grammatical language when trying to explain things.
In our own research, we have found that people remain somewhat mysterious to dogs for the first five months of life, and dogs at our local pound lag considerably behind house dogs when it comes to understanding human beings.
Recent research by Alexandra Horowitz at Barnard College in New York accentuates the “talking past each other” that sometimes goes on between humans and dogs.
Horowitz asked owners to forbid their dogs to take a biscuit and then briefly leave the room.
When the owners returned after a few moments away, some were told that their dogs had been naughty and eaten the forbidden food.
Others were told their dog had been good and left the biscuit alone.
If the dog had misbehaved, the owner was given a moment to berate his pet for its misdeed.
The owners were then asked whether their dog looked guilty.
The twist in this tale is that only half of the owners were correctly informed.
Half of the time, Horowitz told the owner of a dog that had actually left the biscuit alone that his dog had taken the treat.
And half the time the owner of a naughty dog was told that his dog had been good.
The point of this deception was that when Horowitz asked each owner whether his dog looked guilty, she could consider whether the owner’s report of “guilty looks” actually had to do with the facts of the matter – whether the dog had taken the forbidden treat – or whether it reflected nothing more than whether the owner had chastised his hound.
The results showed very clearly that a dog’s “guilty looks” came about solely because it was being scolded: the look had nothing to do with whether the dog had really committed an offense.
This does not mean that we should not chastise our dogs (or praise them).
Nor does it mean that we should not love our dogs – or sometimes be frustrated by them.
All it means is that, if we want to live harmoniously with another species in our most intimate places, we must recognize that some of the time our preferred modes of reasoning are not theirs.
We must try to understand dogs on their own terms, and help them to understand us.
Emerging Markets Should Go for the Gold
CAMBRIDGE – Are emerging-market central banks overweight in dollars and underweight in gold?
Given a slowing global economy, in which emerging markets are probably very grateful for any reserves they retain, this might seem an ill-timed question.
But there is a good case to be made that a shift in emerging markets toward accumulating gold would help the international financial system function more smoothly and benefit everyone.
Just to be clear, I am not siding with those – usually American far-right crackpots – who favor a return to the gold standard, in which countries fix the value of their currencies in terms of gold.
After all, the gold standard’s last reign ended disastrously in the 1930s, and there is no reason to believe that a return to it would turn out any differently.
No, I am just proposing that emerging markets shift a significant share of the trillions of dollars in foreign-currency reserves that they now hold (China alone has official reserves of $3.3 trillion) into gold.
Even shifting, say, up to 10% of their reserves into gold would not bring them anywhere near the many rich countries that hold 60-70% of their (admittedly smaller) official reserves in gold.
For some time, the rich countries have argued that it is in everyone’s collective interest to demonetize gold.
Sure, we hold a lot of gold, these countries say, but that is a vestige of the pre-World War II gold standard, when central banks needed a stockpile.
Indeed, back in 1999, European central banks, seeing no reason to keep holding so much gold, entered a pact to start reducing their stocks in an orderly fashion.
The sales made sense at the time for most of the participating countries: The real backing for their debt was the tax reach of their governments, their high levels of institutional development, and their relative political stability.
The 1999 pact has been revisited periodically, though since the most recent edition in 2014, most rich countries have taken a long pause, still leaving them with extremely high gold reserves.
Emerging markets have remained buyers of gold, but at a snail’s pace compared to their voracious appetite for US Treasury bonds and other rich-country debt.
As of March 2016, China held just over 2% of its reserves in gold, and the share for India was 5%. Russia is really the only major emerging market to increase its gold purchases significantly, in no small part due to Western sanctions, with holdings now amounting to almost 15% of reserves.
Emerging markets hold reserves because they do not have the luxury of being able to inflate their way out of a financial crunch or a government debt crisis.
Simply put, they live in a world where a large fraction of international debt – and an even larger share of global trade – is still denominated in hard currency.
So they hold reserves of such currencies as a backstop against fiscal and financial catastrophe.
Yes, in principle, it would be a much better world if emerging markets could somehow pool their resources, perhaps through an International Monetary Fund facility; but the trust required to make such an arrangement work simply is not yet there.
Why would the system work better with a larger share of gold reserves?
The problem with the status quo is that emerging markets as a group are competing for rich-country bonds, which is helping to drive down the interest rates they receive.
With interest rates stuck near zero, rich-country bond prices cannot drop much more than they already have, while the supply of advanced-country debt is limited by tax capacity and risk tolerance.
Gold, despite being in nearly fixed supply, does not have this problem, because there is no limit on its price.
Moreover, there is a case to be made that gold is an extremely low-risk asset with average real returns comparable to very short-term debt.
And, because gold is a highly liquid asset – a key criterion for a reserve asset – central banks can afford to look past its short-term volatility to longer-run average returns.
True, gold does not pay interest, and there are costs associated with storage.
But these costs can be managed relatively efficiently by holding gold offshore if necessary (many countries hold gold at the New York Federal Reserve); and, over time, the price can go up.
It is for this reason that the system as a whole can never run out of monetary gold.
I don’t want to create the impression that by shifting into gold, emerging markets would somehow benefit at the expense of advanced economies.
After all, the status quo is that advanced-economy central banks and treasuries hold vastly more gold than emerging markets do, and a systematic shift by emerging markets will bid up its price.
But this is not a systemic problem; and, in fact, a rise in gold prices would close part of the gap between demand and supply for safe assets that has emerged due to the zero lower bound on interest rates.
There has never been a compelling reason for emerging markets to buy into the rich-country case for completely demonetizing gold. And there isn’t one now.
Golden Rules for the Eurozone
LONDON – The European Monetary Union, as many of its critics maintain, looks a lot like the pre-1913 gold standard, which imposed fixed exchange rates on extremely diverse economies.
But is that resemblance as bad as it sounds, or as the euro’s critics insist?
The appeal of the historic gold standard lay in an institutional capacity to build confidence.
A completely fixed exchange rate rules out monetary-policy initiative, and consequently makes adjustment to large external imbalances very difficult to carry out.
And the burden is unequal, because there is much more pressure on deficit countries to adjust via deflation than on creditor countries to allow higher inflation.
Pessimists are especially worried by the unpleasant gold-standard analogies and lessons.
They foresee years and even decades of slow growth in Europe.
Politically, too, the process of adjustment by deflation in deficit countries is so unpleasant and difficult that many pessimists think it will ultimately prove to be unsustainable.
But critics of the euro should take the gold-standard analogy more seriously.
Like any system in the real world, it was more complex, more interesting, and also filled with more real policy possibilities than textbook caricatures suggest.
First, there was no automatic deflationary pressure following from some alleged peculiarity of the adjustment mechanism.
The question of overall deflationary – or inflationary – impact depended (and still depends) on the total quantity of money.
Thus, in periods after large new gold discoveries – for example, following the California Gold Rush of 1849, and again in the 1890’s, when new mining techniques opened up South African, Alaskan, and Australian reserves – the classical gold standard had a mild inflationary bias.
In an era of paper money, however, the link to a physical stock of some precious metal – or, indeed, some other commodity – does not exist, and there should be no reason why a central bank cannot aim at an overall inflation rate.
In fact, almost all modern central banks, including the European Central Bank, do precisely that.
The second lesson to be learned from the gold standard concerns the extent and limits of capital-market integration.
In the early 1990’s, policymakers, market participants, and economists alike simply assumed that the European Community’s “1992 program” – the legislative framework for the single market, and thus for a single capital market – would create a new reality, within which the single currency would work its magic.
From this followed an official obligation to treat all types of risk in the monetary union – bank risk or government risk – as identical.
But the history of the gold standard, and of other large common-currency areas, was more complex.
Despite the theoretical possibility of capital being sent over vast distances to other parts of the world, much capital remained local.
Creditors and banks often preferred to do business with known borrowers, and where local jurisdictions could settle any disputes.
In particular, a critical part of the gold standard was that individual national central banks set their own interest rates, with the aim of influencing the direction of capital movements.
This became the central feature of the gold-standard world: a country that was losing gold reserves would tighten interest rates in order to attract money.
The gold-standard rules look very different from the modern practice of monetary union, which relies on a single uniform interest rate.
That one-size-fits-all approach meant that interest rates in southern European countries were too low before 2009, and too high in northern Europe.
A gold-standard rule would have produced higher rates for the southern European borrowers, which would have attracted funds to where capital might be productively used, and at the same time acted as a deterrent against purely speculative capital flows.
Since the 2008 financial crisis erupted, there has been something of a renationalization of financial behavior in Europe.
Up to the late 1990’s and the advent of monetary union, most European Union sovereign debt was domestically held: in 1998, the overall ratio of foreign-held debt was only one-fifth.
That ratio climbed rapidly in the aftermath of the euro’s introduction.
In 2008, on the eve of the crisis, three-quarters of Portuguese debt, one-half of Spanish and Greek debt, and more than two-fifths of Italian debt was held by foreigners, with foreign banks holding a significant proportion, especially in the case of Greece, Portugal, and Italy.
One consequence of the ECB’s large-scale long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) has been that Italian banks are once again buying Italian government bonds, and Spanish banks are buying Spanish bonds.
German Economics Minister Philipp Rösler has made the fascinating suggestion that members of the European System of Central Banks should set their own interest rates (though, interestingly, he made this suggestion explicitly as a party politician, not as a government minister).
Autonomous interest-rate determination would penalize banks that have borrowed in southern Europe from their national central banks.
Meanwhile, the German Bundesbank would have lower rates, but southern European banks would be unlikely to have access to that credit for use in their own markets.
There are also signs that individual central banks are using the leeway that they have within the existing framework in order to carry out important policy shifts.
The Bundesbank has stated that it will no longer accept bank securities as collateral from banks that have undergone a government recapitalization.
The new collateral requirements, together with tentative talk of autonomous interest rates, represents a remarkable incipient innovation.
In the aftermath of the crisis, some policymakers are beginning to see that a monetary union is not necessarily identical with unfettered capital mobility.
Recognition of diverse credit quality is a step back into the nineteenth-century world, and at the same time forward to a more market-oriented and less distorting currency policy.
Different interest rates in different countries might open the door to a more stable eurozone.
Good and Bad Capitalism
PARIS – The reality of market exchange – direct transactions between merchants and customers – appeared gradually 3,000 or 4,000 years ago.
In this novel social relationship, the customer was free to buy whatever he wanted, whenever and from whomever he chose, often bargaining with the seller about the price.
Because of these features, the free market is part of a basic freedom that is rooted in everyday life.
It remains dominant today, as all efforts to establish an alternative, even totalitarianism, failed.
Indeed, it has been 20 years since the former communist countries of Eastern Europe rejoined the world of market exchange, a step taken as early as 1946 by social democrats around the world.
For several thousand years, the free market was comprised of individuals: craftsmen, traders, and consumers.
Capitalism when it arose three centuries ago was simply the same activity on a larger scale.
Because of steam engines and electricity, a large number of people were enabled to work together, and corporations could attract a large number of small savers, who became capitalists.
This system is fantastic.
By the time of the French Revolution, the standard of living had hardly doubled since the Roman Empire. Today, it is 150 times higher.
But capitalism is also cruel.
At its inception, people were compelled to work 17 hours a day without a day off or retirement. It was a form of slavery.
Thanks to democracy, social struggle, and workers’ unions, together with the political efforts of social democracy, the inhumanity of the system was partly softened.
Nevertheless, left to itself, the system is unstable.
It undergoes a crisis about once a decade.
The twentieth century’s worst crisis, between 1929 and 1932, caused 70 million workers in Great Britain, the United States, and Germany to lose their jobs (with no unemployment benefits) in less than six months.
It brought Adolf Hitler to power, leading to a war that left 50 million dead.
After the war, the belief that the system needed to be stabilized became widespread.&nbsp; Eventually, a more balanced system emerged, based on three main institutions: health insurance, Keynesian fiscal and monetary policy to soften the impact of the business cycle, and, of utmost importance, a policy of high salaries and reduction of economic inequality in order to boost household consumption.
The achievement was stunning: 30 years of consistent and rapid economic growth, full and permanent employment in all developed nations, and no financial or economic crisis.
Standards of living rose nearly ten-fold during this period.
Prosperity became the main weapon that ensured the West’s victory over Soviet communism.
The people of Eastern Europe were eager to embrace this kind of capitalism.
Capitalism’s political success, however, came at the very moment when the system was starting to deteriorate.
High salaries drove growth but reduced earnings.
Shareholders organized themselves into pension funds, investment funds, and hedge funds. Because of their pressure, employment fell, reducing the share of wages in total national income by 10% over the past 30 years.
In developed nations, the number of the working poor reached 10-15% of the workforce, with another 5-10% of unemployed workers and 5-10% dropping out of&nbsp; the labor market altogether.
Moreover, over the past 25 years, a severe financial crisis – regional or global – has erupted every four or five years.
Annual growth fell below 3% on average.
Today’s crisis was triggered by widespread concealment of bad loans within pools of securities sold all over the world.
The spread of bankruptcies triggered a severe credit crunch, which triggered a deep recession and with it a brutal rise in unemployment.
Capitalism’s three stabilizing devices lost their efficacy.
While rich countries reacted more quickly and more wisely in stimulating their economies than in 1929, and the hemorrhaging of banks was stanched, this has not been enough to boost growth.
We are now in a strange period in which governments, bankers, and journalists herald the end of the crisis just because large banks are no longer failing every week.
But nothing has been solved, and unemployment continues to rise.
Even worse, the banking sector is trying to take advantage of publicly financed rescue packages to protect its privileges, including immorally huge bonuses and extravagant freedoms to create speculative financial assets with no links to the real economy.
Indeed, the so-called end of the crisis looks more like a reconstruction of the mechanisms that caused it.
Everywhere, economic activity is painfully stabilizing at 5% to 10% below 2007 levels.
The root of the crisis remains the fall in purchasing power on the part of the middle and lower classes, and the collapse of speculative bubbles created by the wealthy classes’ greed for more.
But if we are to have a system where nearly everybody can become better off, the wealthy cannot become ever wealthier at the same time.
Otherwise, we can expect a long period of stagnation, punctuated by periodic financial crises.
In these circumstances, a majority of European voters have recently shown, once again, that they favor the right and its tendency to support the fortune seekers.
A bleak future awaits us.
Good and Bad Deficits
LONDON – “Deficits are always bad,” thunder fiscal hawks.
Not so, replies strategic investment analyst H. Wood Brock in an interesting new book, The American Gridlock.
A proper assessment, Brock argues, depends on the “composition and quality of total government spending.”
Government deficits incurred on current spending for services or transfers are bad, because they produce no revenue and add to the national debt.
Deficits resulting from capital spending, by contrast, are – or can be – good.
If wisely administered, such spending produces a revenue stream that services and eventually extinguishes the debt; more importantly, it raises productivity, and thus improves a country’s long-run growth potential.
From this distinction follows an important fiscal rule: governments’ current spending should normally be balanced by taxation.
To this extent, efforts nowadays to reduce deficits on current spending are justified, but only if they are fully replaced by capital-spending programs.
Indeed, reducing current spending and increasing capital spending should be carried out in lock step.
Brock’s argument is that, given the state of its economy, the United States cannot return to full employment on the basis of current policy.
The recovery is too feeble, and the country needs to invest an additional $1 trillion annually for ten years on transport facilities and education.
The government should establish a National Infrastructure Bank to provide the finance by borrowing directly, attracting private-sector funds, or a mixture of the two.
(I have proposed a similar institution in the United Kingdom.)
The distinction between capital and current spending (and thus between “good” and “bad” deficits) is old hat to any student of public finance.
But we forget knowledge at such an alarming rate that it is worth re-stating it, particularly with deficit hawks in power in the UK and Europe, though fortunately not (yet) in the US.
According to proposals agreed at an informal European Council meeting on January 30, all EU members are to amend their constitutions to introduce a balanced-budget rule that caps annual structural deficits at 0.5% of GDP.
This ceiling can be raised only in a deep depression or other exceptional circumstances, allowing for counter-cyclical policy so long as it is agreed that the additional deficit is cyclical, rather than structural.
Otherwise, violations would automatically trigger fines of up to 0.1% of GDP.
The UK is one of two EU countries (alongside the Czech Republic) that refused to sign this “fiscal compact,” acceptance of which is required to gain access to European bailout funds.
But Britain’s government has the identical aim of reducing its current deficit of 10% of GDP to near zero in five years.
An argument commonly heard in support of such policies is that the “bond vigilantes” will demand nothing less.
And the finances of some European governments (and Latin American governments in the recent past) have been so parlous that this reaction is understandable.
But that is not true of the US or the UK, which both have large fiscal deficits.
And most countries were adhering to reasonably tight fiscal discipline before the crisis of 2008 undermined their banks, cut their tax revenues, and forced up their sovereign debt.
At the same time, we should not attribute current enthusiasm for fiscal retrenchment to such contingencies.
At its heart lies the belief that all government spending above a necessary minimum is wasteful.
Europe has its own Tea Party crackpots who loathe the welfare state and want it abolished or radically pared, and who are convinced that all state-sponsored capital spending is a “boondoggle” – just so many roads, bridges, and railway lines to nowhere that soak up their money in corruption and inefficiency.
Those who believe this are unfazed by the corruption and waste that characterizes much private-sector spending.
And they prefer the total waste of letting millions of people sit idle (Brock reckons that 16% of the American workforce is unemployed, underemployed, or too discouraged to seek work) to the possibly partial waste of programs that put them to work, nurture their skills, and equip the country with assets.
One can criticize details of Brock’s case: a deeper understanding of Keynes would have given him a more persuasive response to the objection that, if state-financed projects were worth doing, the private sector would be doing them.
Before long, we will have to provide answers to these questions, because the pre-slump fiscal rules that the Europeans are vainly trying to strengthen were not up to the job.
We are far from having worked out a post-recession theory of macroeconomic policy, but certain elements are clear.
In the future, fiscal and monetary policy will have to work together: neither on its own can stabilize inherently unstable market economies.
Monetary policy will have to do much more than it did before 2008 to restrain financial markets’ “irrational exuberance.”
And we need a new, unambiguous system of fiscal accounting that distinguishes between tax-funded government spending and public spending that pays for itself.
Above all, we need to recognize that the state’s role goes beyond maintaining external security and domestic law and order.
As Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations:
“The third and last duty of the sovereign....is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual, or small number of individuals; and which it, therefore, cannot be expected that any individual, or small number of individuals, should erect or maintain.”
Chief among these public works, for Smith, are those that “facilitate the commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals, harbors, etc.”
Another piece of forgotten knowledge that Smith also mentions is the importance of education.
He is right to do so, however much today’s deficit hawks seem, by their behavior, to prove the opposite.
Goodbye to “Globalization”
FLORENCE – The term “globalization” first swept the world in the 1990’s and reached its highpoint of popularity in 2000 and 2001.
In 2001, for instance, Le Monde contained more than 3,500 references to mondialisation.
But then the figure steadily fell – more than 80% by 2006.
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, the word’s usage in major newspapers such as the New York Times and the Financial Times has fallen still further.
Globalization is on its way out.
A brief history of the concept, and a comparison with another term that also became discredited by overuse, helps to explain what happened.
The twentieth century’s two most important conceptual innovations, “totalitarianism” and “globalization,” were originally Italian.
The first term defined the tumultuous middle of the twentieth century, the latter its benign ending.
“Totalitarianism” finally disintegrated in 1989, and globalization prevailed.
Both terms originated as criticisms that were supposed to undermine and subvert the political tendencies they described.
But both ended up being just as frequently and enthusiastically used by the respective tendencies’ proponents.
“Totalitarianism” began its conceptual life in 1923 as a criticism or parody by the liberal writer Giovanni Amendola of the megalomaniacal pretensions of Benito Mussolini’s new regime.
In the course of a few years, it had become the proud self-definition of Italian fascism, endorsed by Mussolini’s education minister, Giovanni Gentile, who became the official philosopher of fascism, and then incorporated in a ghost-written article by Mussolini himself in the Encyclopedia of Fascism.
In both the hostile and the celebratory use of the word, totalitarianism was intended to describe a movement that embraced all aspects of life in what purported to be a coherent philosophy of politics, economics, and society.
Fascists liked to think of themselves as imbued with total knowledge and total power.
Today, few know where the term “globalization” originated.
The Oxford English Dictionary gives as the earliest reference to its current usage an academic article from 1972.
The word had been used earlier, but in a rather different sense.
It was a diplomatic term conveying the linkage between disparate policy areas (for example, in negotiating simultaneously on financial and security matters).
The OED etymology ignores the non-English origins of the term, which can be found in the inventive linguistic terminology of continental European student radicalism.
In 1970, the radical left-wing Italian underground periodical Sinistra Proletaria carried an article entitled “The Process of Globalization of Capitalist Society,” which was a description of IBM, an “organization which presents itself as a totality and controls all its activities towards the goal of profit and ‘globalizes’ all activity in the productive process.”
Because IBM, according to the article, produced in 14 countries and sold in 109, it “contains in itself the globalization (mondializzazione) of capitalist imperialism.”
This obscure left-wing publication is the first known reference to globalization in its contemporary sense.
Since then, the term has had ups and downs. It became increasingly faddish in the 1990’s, but mostly as a term of abuse.
In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, anti-globalization demonstrations targeted the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Economic Forum, and McDonald’s.
Globalization was seen at this time – as in the vision of the 1960’s Italian leftists – as the exploitation of the world’s poor by a plutocratic and technocratic elite.
But in the 2000’s, the meaning of globalization shifted and began to take on a semi-positive note, in large part because it increasingly looked as if the major winners of globalization included many rapidly growing emerging markets.
Indeed, countries that had previously been described as “under-developed” or “Third World” were becoming incipient global hegemons.
Moreover, many former critics began to recognize global connectedness as a way of solving global problems such as climate change, economic crisis, and poverty.
Historians have started to project globalization backwards.
It is no longer seen only as a story of the capital-market-driven integration of the last two decades of the twentieth century, or even of an “early wave of globalization” in the nineteenth century, when the gold standard and the Atlantic telegram seemed to unite the world.
Instead, the wider and deeper historical vision is of a globalization that encompasses the Roman empire and the Song dynasty, and goes back to the globalization of the human species from a common African origin.
The terms that we use to describe complex political and social phenomena and processes have odd ambiguities.
Some concepts that are designed as criticisms are quickly inverted to become celebratory.
By 2011, anti-globalization rhetoric had largely faded, and globalization is thought of as not something to be neither fought nor cheered, but as a fundamental characteristic of the human story, in which disparate geographies and diverse themes are inextricably intertwined.
In short, globalization has lost its polemical bite, and with that loss, its attractions as a concept have faded.
Goodbye to the Dollar?
CAMBRIDGE – As the world’s financial leaders meet in Washington this month at the World Bank-International Monetary Fund annual meeting, perhaps they should be glad there is no clear alternative to the dollar as the global currency standard.
If the euro were fully ready for prime time, we might well be seeing it’s dollar exchange rate jump to over 2.00, and not just to 1.65 or 1.70, as it seems poised to do anyway.
You can’t treat your customers as badly as the United States has done lately if they can go elsewhere.
Over the past six years, the value of the trade-weighted dollar has fallen by more than a quarter, as the US has continued to rack up historically unprecedented trade deficits.
With a soft economy, a badly compromised financial system, and serious concerns about rising inflation, the long-term dollar trend is downward, however the current crisis ends.
And it is not over.
The Federal Reserve’s bailout of the financial system is unlikely to stand up unless banks find fresh capital, and lots of it.
Ultra-rich sovereign wealth funds have the cash to rescue US banks. But they are unlikely to want to do so at this point, even if the US political system allowed it.
Instead, as the credit crunch and housing price decline continue, an epic mortgage bailout appears increasingly likely, possibly costing US taxpayers a trillion dollars or more.
The problem is that after so many years of miserable returns on dollar assets, will global investors really be willing to absorb another trillion dollars in US debt at anything near current interest rates and exchange rates?
US debt hardly looks like a bargain right now, even without the sinking dollar.
Far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch the country’s fiscal resources, with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars, according a recent study by Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz. 
Next year will almost certainly see a massive rise in US corporate defaults, even though many firms entered the recession with relatively strong balance sheets.
State and municipal finances are in even worse shape.
With tax revenues collapsing due to falling home prices and incomes, dozens of US municipalities could well go into receivership, as New York City did in the 1970’s.
US municipal bonds are already trading at huge risk premia, and the first big government default hasn’t even hit yet.
Of course, if the dollar were to fall off its perch as the world’s dominant currency any time soon, the euro would be the only serious alternative.
The Yuan may well supplant the dollar in the second half of this century.
But China’s draconian capital controls and massive financial repression currently disqualify it from anchoring the global economic system.
Fortunately for the dollar, the euro, too, seems to have its problems.
European banks remain balkanized, with a patchwork of national regulators seeking to promote their own champions.
European governments’ debt may all be denominated in euro, but German and Italian debt are hardly the same thing, so the government euro-bond market lacks the depth and liquidity of the US Treasury Bill market.  
Moreover, international investors can buy and sell real estate far more easily in the US than in most of Europe.
And the absence of a Europe-wide fiscal policy creates significant uncertainty about how the European Central Bank would finance itself if it suddenly faced large losses on junk bank debt after a big bailout.
But the euro does have growing strengths.
At current market exchange rates, the European Union is now larger economically than the US.
New central and eastern European members are bringing enormous dynamism and flexibility.
At the same time, the ECB has gained considerable credibility from its handling of the global credit crisis.
Indeed, if the euro zone can persuade Great Britain to become a full-fledged member, thereby acquiring one of the world’s two premier financial centers (London), the euro might really start to look like a viable alternative to the dollar.
In 1971, as the dollar collapsed towards the end of the post-World War II fixed exchange-rate system, US Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told his foreign counterparts that “the dollar is our currency, but your problem.”
And the dollar’s exalted global status has survived ever since, despite many episodes of neglect and abuse.
World currency standards have enormous inertia.
The British pound only forfeited its role to the US dollar after more than 50 years of industrial decline and two world wars.
But it could happen a lot faster this time.
As central bankers and finance ministers ponder how to intervene to prop up the dollar, they should also start thinking about what to do when the time comes to pull the plug.
Good Governance Begins At Home
The whole sorry Wolfowitz affair looks like it is finally drawing to a close.
It is hard to believe that he will stay on much longer at the World Bank, and it is time to start thinking more closely about the future of that institution.
From the first, I was critical of the way he was chosen because I have long opposed the “old boy” agreement between the United States and Europe, by which the US always appoints the head of the World Bank and Europe the head of the IMF.
This unspoken arrangement dates from the founding of the Bretton Woods institution at a time when colonialism was still alive, and makes no sense in the twenty-first century.
There are reports that European leaders have told the US that if they get Wolfowitz to step down quickly and quietly, they will be allowed to choose Wolfowitz’s successor.
It’s easy to see why the US and Europe want to stick to business as usual, but such a deal would amount to a wasted opportunity.
I can think of no better way to restore confidence in these two venerable institutions than to finally open up the way their presidents are selected.
One of the lessons of the Wolfowitz debacle is that it does actually matter how stakeholders and employees feel about the Bank’s leadership.
The world was prejudiced against him from the start because of his involvement in the Iraq War.
But people were willing to give him a chance.
Some said that perhaps he would be another Robert McNamara, the US defense secretary who helped mire America in the Vietnam War, but used his service to the Bank as penance.
At first, there was reason for hope: Wolfowitz was forceful in arguing for debt forgiveness and an end to agricultural subsidies.
But he also hired old friends and political allies – many of whom did not have experience in development – and sealed himself off from his staff, alienating the very people whose support he needed.
As we learned from the case of Larry Summers at Harvard, relationships inside institutions (not just with donors and funders) matter.
In this respect, Wolfowitz, while by all accounts an intelligent and pleasant person, did not do himself any favors.
Worse, Wolfowitz did not seem to have a grand vision for the Bank. Instead of a development strategy, there was simply an expansion of the anti-corruption agenda initiated by his predecessor, James Wolfensohn.
As the World Bank’s Chief Economist under Wolfensohn, I had argued that failing to deal with corruption risked undermining growth and poverty alleviation.
By the time I left the Bank, these ideas were widely accepted, and I was pleased that Wolfowitz supported continuing the Bank’s efforts.
But the fight against corruption was always to be only one part of a more comprehensive development agenda that was required.
Indeed, aid effectiveness could be undermined just as much by incompetence as by corruption.
Sadly, the anti corruption agenda of the Bank became politicized.
There was a push to give money to Iraq – a country rife with corruption – while other countries were accused of corruption without adequate hard evidence or specific details.
And here, too, an opportunity was lost.
The aims of the campaign were laudable, but it generated hostility and ill will, undermining its effectiveness.
The World Bank, in its efforts to support democracy and good governance, must insist on the highest standards of due process: charges of corruption should be treated seriously, and the evidence turned over to national authorities for use in open, transparent, and independent proceedings.
This is something for Wolfowitz’s successor to bear in mind.
If anti-corruption campaigns are to be seen as effective, they must be fair and transparent.
The same is true of the selection of the World Bank’s president.
There is still a chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
What has been a sad and sorry saga could have a happy ending if Wolfowitz’s successor is chosen in an open, transparent process.
This, one hopes, is the silver lining in the cloud now hanging over the World Bank.
Goodluck Nigeria
LAGOS – The bombs that exploded in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, as the country was celebrating its golden jubilee earlier this month are a disturbing portent of the unprecedented political territory that the country is entering.
The death last May of Umaru Yar’Adua, Nigeria’s president, upended the informal agreement between members of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to rotate power between northern Muslims and their southern, mainly Christian counterparts.
Yar’Adua’s deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, from the oil-rich Niger Delta in the south, overcame resistance from members of the late president’s cabinet and was sworn in as Yar’Adua’s successor, as stipulated by the constitution.
In September, he told Nigerians of his intention to run for another presidential term in 2011.
President Jonathan’s announcement triggered furious protests from his northern rivals, including Ibrahim Babangida, a former military dictator who reminded him that Olusegun Obasanjo, a southerner, had served as president from 1999, when military rule ended, to 2007, with northern support.
Yar’Adua had completed only three years of his first four-year term when he died, and it was expected that all southerners, including Jonathan, would unite behind another northerner for next year’s vote.
But resentment of northerners’ perceived dominance of national politics runs deep in the south, particularly in the Niger Delta, where 50 years of uncontrolled oil production has resulted in polluted farmlands and deepening poverty.
The ethnic minority groups that inhabit the area complain that the current revenue-allocation formula, which leaves Nigeria’s oil-producing states with only 13% of oil revenue, is grossly unfair and insufficient compensation for the damaged ecology they endure.
In January 2006, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a violent organization led by angry Delta youth, began to attack oil installations and the soldiers guarding them.
MEND and other local groups are demanding that the country return to “true federalism” in the spirit of 1960, and that 50% of oil revenue be retained by the region’s inhabitants.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and founder of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a grassroots movement in Ogoniland, had called for this as well, before he was hanged by General Sani Abacha’s junta in 1995.
Leading voices in the region have come out strongly in Jonathan’s support, and have asked him to ignore northern politicians who insist that the PDP’s power rotation arrangement be respected.
Delta leaders point out that 2011 is the ‘minorities’ turn to govern the country after being sat upon by the larger ethnic groups since the end of colonial rule in 1960.
It is not yet clear whether Goodluck Jonathan will be able to translate this sectional support into enough votes in the party primaries and beyond to retain the presidency.
He has the advantage of a massive war chest, given that Nigeria’s leaders have always done with the public treasury what they liked.
But General Babangida also has deep pockets.
Besides, PDP’s powerful governors, in control of 28 of the country’s 36 states, see Jonathan as an upstart who came from the middle of nowhere to become president.
The powers of the Nigerian presidency are extensive, and Jonathan’s handlers have been dropping loud hints that they will deploy them to whip the governors – including the northerners – into line.
Northern PDP leaders, still pressuring the region’s large group of presidential contenders, including Babangida, to agree on who will fight it out with Jonathan, are already looking beyond the primaries.
They are threatening to take the northern vote to another party if they lose the PDP ticket.
This could have far-reaching consequences for the PDP and the country. The PDP, in power since military rule ended in 1999, is widely disliked.
Corruption is widespread, and PDP politicians have been unable to deliver the prosperity and improved social services that Nigerians looked forward to following the return of democracy.
Indeed, the PDP has been able to retain power only by rigging successive elections, most spectacularly in 2007, when the outgoing Obasanjo foisted Yar’Adua on the party hierarchy.
The poorly resourced opposition could benefit if the expected northern backlash divides the PDP.
Nuhu Ribadu, the respected former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has announced his intention to contest the presidency as the candidate of one of the opposition parties.
A Muslim northerner, Ribadu enjoys the support of youth and democrats nationwide.
The latter are regaining confidence in the political process, following the recent appointment of a no-nonsense academic as head of the election commission.
Muhammadu Buhari, whom Babangida replaced as military head of state in 1985, is also expected to run, as the nominee of the Congress of Progressive Change.
Doubts linger about whether longtime northern PDP leaders, used to cutting midnight deals with their southern counterparts, would break ranks and support Ribadu next year.
Conservative northerners also view Buhari, an ascetic politician popular with the region’s poor, with unease.
Even if they overcome their reservations and back Ribadu or Buhari, and either candidate goes on to beat Jonathan at the polls, angry Delta youths could respond with fresh violence against oil workers, disrupting production.
Other trouble spots – central Nigeria, where ethnic tensions are simmering, and the far north, the stomping ground of Boko Haram, a violent Muslim sect – could get sucked into election-related violence.
With industries collapsing because of constant power outages, unemployment soaring, and cynical politicians forcing their impoverished followers into ethnic and religious laagers, Nigeria’s 2011 elections are shaping up to be a perfect storm.
In the past, Nigeria has always managed to weather its political tempests.
Will it do so again?
Good Policies for Great Countries
NEW YORK – We are in a protracted period of international transition, one that began more than two decades ago with the Cold War’s end.
That era of strategic rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union gave way to one in which the US possessed far greater power than any other country and enjoyed an unprecedented degree of influence.
That American unipolar moment has given way to a world better described as non-polar, in which power is widely distributed among nearly 200 states and tens of thousands of non-state actors ranging from Al Qaeda to Al Jazeera and from Goldman Sachs to the United Nations.
But what distinguishes historical eras from one another is less the distribution of power than the degree of order between and within states.
Order never just emerges; it is the result of conscious efforts by the most powerful entities in the world.
While the US remains the world’s most powerful single country, it cannot maintain, much less expand, international peace and prosperity on its own.
It is over-extended, dependent upon massive daily imports of dollars and oil, and its armed forces are engaged in demanding conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The US lacks the means and the political consensus to take on much more in the way of global responsibility. It also lacks the means to compel others to follow its lead.
Moreover, contemporary problems – for example, thwarting the spread of materials and weapons of mass destruction, maintaining an open world economy, slowing climate change, and combating terrorism – cannot be managed, much less solved, by any single country.
Only collective efforts can meet common challenges; the more global the response, the more likely that it will succeed.
In short, the US requires partners if the twenty-first century is to be an era in which the majority of people around the world enjoy relative peace and satisfactory standards of living.
But the partnerships that prevailed in the Cold War  – between the US, Western Europe, and several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia – are no longer adequate.
These countries lack the resources and often the will to manage most of the world’s problems.
So the old partners need new ones.
Emerging powers have the potential to fill this need.
The question is what China, India, Brazil, and others are prepared to do with their growing strength.
What makes a country great is not the size of its territory, population, army, or economy, but how it uses its power to shape the world beyond its borders.
Countries that are strong but still developing tend to regard foreign policy as little more than a hand-maiden of domestic policy and a means to gain access to markets and resources essential for rapid development.
This outlook is understandable, but shortsighted.
Rising powers can neither insulate nor isolate themselves from what happens beyond their borders.
Whether or not they acknowledge it, they have a stake in world order.
Consider China, by many measures the most significant emerging country.
It wants to maintain preferred access to Iran’s energy resources, but if conflict results from Iran’s nuclear aspirations, China will be paying much more for those resources.
The prospect of a threat to the stability of the greater Middle East and to the flow of oil should give China an incentive to support robust sanctions against Iran.
But it is not clear whether China’s leaders will recognize this and act in their country’s own long-term self interest.
The point is not to single out China. Similar questions apply to India and Brazil.
And it is not just the developing and emerging countries that must reconsider their approach to the world. The US must do so as well.
While much has been said and written about America’s call for China to become a global stakeholder, China will not simply sign on as a pillar of an American-defined world.
It wants to help set the rules and build the institutions for enforcing them.
It is up to the US to work with China and others to do this, and this requires America’s openness to others’ preferences and their having a larger role.
The empowerment of the G-20 is a step in the right direction, but many more changes are needed, including restructuring the UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank so that they, too, reflect the new distribution of power.
In return, new arrangements should call on emerging countries to contribute more to addressing climate change, paying for peacekeeping and state-building, promoting free trade, and sanctioning those who support terror or develop weapons of mass destruction.
This era’s major states, developed and emerging alike, have the ability to reach accord on today’s defining issues.
Their willingness to do so will determine when and how this period of global transition ends and what succeeds it.
Good Times Down Latin America’s Way
MEXICO CITY – For Latin America, 2011 was, in Frank Sinatra’s terms, a very good year –&nbsp;and 2012 doesn’t look like being so bad either.
For a region not always accustomed to things going well, this is a somewhat strange state of affairs.
Three elections were held in Latin America in 2011.
Two – in Argentina and Peru – went well; the other – in Nicaragua – was marred by egregious fraud and heavy-handed government intervention in favor of the incumbent.
Still, two out of three is not bad in a region where, previously, if elections were held at all, disputes about the outcomes were the norm.
In economic terms, high commodity prices fueled strong growth in South America in 2011, and the modest US recovery benefited nearby countries.
In Chile, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil and Colombia, voracious Chinese and Indian demand for raw materials and food boosted foreign reserves, enabled heavy government spending, and sustained high levels of imports.
All this led to average growth rates well in excess of 4%.
But it also led to new doubts about the wisdom of reliance on commodity exports.
Chilean economist and politician Carlos Ominami, in his tell-all memoir Secretos de la Concertación, wondered what would happen if China's economy slowed or its real-estate bubble burst.
By the end of the year, this seemed to be happening: commodity prices and growth rates were dropping, and 2012, while still promising strong economic performance, will not match this year's success.
Sustained lower prices may bring chickens home to roost.
The outliers were Venezuela, despite high oil prices, and the Caribbean Basin: Mexico, Central America, and the islands.
These countries export manufactured goods to the US, on which they also rely for tourism and remittances; they lack either the geography or the geology to become great commodity exporters (or, like Mexico, they export all of their oil to the US).
But even the outliers enjoyed decent growth this year.
If the US avoids a new slowdown, they may do better than South America in 2012.
All told, with the exception of 2009, the entire region will have experienced a full decade of uninterrupted growth – something not witnessed since the 1970’s.
The boom fueled expansion of Latin America’s middle classes.
Between 1950 and 1980, most Latin American countries’ middle classes comprised between one-quarter and one-third of the population.
Then came the debt crisis of the 1980’s, the extreme &nbsp;structural reforms and financial collapses of the 1990’s, and a new global downturn in 2001.
Such traumatic events plunged these countries into the so-called “middle-income trap”: unable to grow nor to continue broadening their middle classes.
But, by the second half of the 2000’s, everything changed: prolonged macroeconomic stability, competent center-left or center-right governments, sensible social policies, and global economic growth allowed countries like Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and even Argentina to take the next giant step.
By 2008 or so, around 55% of these countries’ populations belonged to the middle class, by whatever definition one used.
Access to credit, more jobs, remittances, the commodity boom, and conditional cash transfers enabled millions to purchase a home, a car, and a better life.
This was not a middle class modeled on North Atlantic precedents, and its members’ status is precarious and reversible; moreover, their standard of living is well below that of their counterparts in wealthier countries.
But a middle class it is.
These middle-income sectors make up an even larger part of the electorate, since their turnout rates are higher than those of the poor.
Political candidates must engage them, occasionally pander to them, and tailor their message to them, all of which steers leaders and parties toward moderate positions.
There are no guarantees that this will endure, but it is one of the region’s most impressive achievements in recent years.
Latin America will witness two important elections in 2012, in Venezuela and Mexico, and one non-election, in Cuba.
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chávez’s opponents will unite behind a single candidate for October’s presidential election.
But everything depends on Chávez’s health, which, like that of Fidel Castro in Cuba a closely guarded state secret.
Will Chávez’s cancer allow him to run (he is as formidable a campaigner as he is a terrible economic manager), win, and govern until 2030?
Will he be a stand-in for his more radical brother (and designated successor), Adán?
Or will he be too ill to participate?
In that case – and most importantly – would he, Adán, and the entire “Bolivarian” elite accept defeat at the polls?
In Cuba, there will be no elections, but matters may come to a head next year.
Raúl Castro’s economic reforms have either not been implemented, or are not delivering the expected results; the island continues to depend on Venezuelan subsidies, remittances from Miami, and European tourists.
Cuba’s octogenarian ruling brothers cannot last forever.
Something may have to give on the island, especially if their Venezuelan benefactor is no longer in power.
Then there is Mexico, which will hold only its fourth democratic election in its history in a context of rampant organized crime, appalling violence, and rising skepticism about President Felipe Calderón’s war on drugs.
With three contending parties, a terrible electoral law, no run-off, and condiderable frustration with 12 years of center-right, often ineffective governments, the outcome is highly uncertain.
That said, Mexico’s political institutions have survived hard times, the middle class rejects extremism, and the US is close by.
One would prefer to see Mexico’s presidential candidates offer platforms with ideas and proposals that respond to the challenges facing the country, but this substance deficit occurs everywhere now, almost all the time.
For a region that has suffered so long from frustration and despair over its failures, these are among the best of times.
Latin America should count its blessings, and remember that nothing lasts forever.
The Tinkerer’s Apprentice
BERLIN – The best inventions are never finished.
When the German engineer Karl Benz invented the first petroleum-powered automobile, he did not just create an engine with wheels; he set in motion an industry that revolutionized the way society was structured.
Similarly, the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee did not only build the world’s first Web site. He laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web.
Neither could have anticipated the impact of what he was doing.
If there is one lesson that economic policymakers should heed in 2015 and beyond, it is this: Just as invention is dynamic, so are the industries it creates.
As we learned in 2014, it is a lesson that has yet to sink in entirely.
When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer.
The engineering behind it was technically complicated, but what you got was pretty rough: a page of text, broken up by ten blue links.
It was better than anything else, but not great by today’s standards.
So our co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin – like all other successful inventors – kept iterating.
They started with images.
After all, people wanted more than just text.
This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world’s attention.
At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen.
But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J­Lo wearing that dress.
Google Image Search was born.
Maps are another great example.
When people search Google for an address, they do not want a link to Web sites that mention the street.
They usually want to know how to get there.
So we built a map that was clickable, draggable, and easy to explore.
Maps have become such an integral part of Google that most users probably cannot imagine it without them.
It has been the same with many of our changes.
Our searches have gotten better over time.
Google the weather where you live and you will get the forecast for the next few days as the top result, saving you time and effort.
But Google’s efforts to provide direct answers to questions have fueled complaints at the European Commission.
Companies like Expedia, Yelp, and TripAdvisor argue that Google searches are depriving their Web sites of valuable traffic, putting their businesses at a disadvantage.
Instead of us providing you with images, maps, the weather, news, or translated versions of foreign-language sites, they would rather go back to ten blue links.
A few years ago, a lawyer for one of our competitors drew a picture of a coastline with a little island offshore.
He added a dotted line, explaining that this was the only ferry connecting the island to the mainland.
His point was that Google was just like the ferry: the only way to navigate the Internet.
In reality, there are many ways to get around on the Web.
For news, you might go directly to your favorite news service.
If you want to buy something, you might go directly to Zalando or Amazon, where you can research models and prices, get reviews, and pay for your purchase all at once.
The real point is that the economic landscape in which we are operating is not only competitive; it is changing constantly.
This year, our industry reached an important milestone.
For the first time, people are spending more time on mobile devices than on their desktop computers.
Time spent on desktops has now fallen to just 40%.
And people use mobile devices very differently from the way they use desktops.
Seven out of every eight minutes spent on a mobile phone is spent within an app, and the most popular app in the world is Facebook.
Many people look at Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon, among others, as companies that no competitor could ever beat.
I am less certain.
History is full of examples that show that size and past success guarantee nothing.
Great companies can be surpassed swiftly.
Just a few years ago, companies like Yahoo, Nokia, Microsoft, and Blackberry seemed unrivaled.
They have all since been disrupted by a new wave of tech companies – Google among them.
Google works very differently from other companies that have been dubbed “gatekeepers” and that are regulated accordingly.
We are not a ferry, a railroad, a telecommunications network, or an electricity grid with only one line serving you and no competitors allowed.
No one is stuck using Google.
People have choices, and they exercise them all the time.
We know that if we cease to be useful, our users will leave.
The barriers to entry are negligible, because competition is just one click away.
Someone in a garage somewhere is gunning for us, and 2015 could be the year that they make their move.
I know, because not long ago we were in that garage.
And I know that the next Google will not do what Google does, just as Google did not do what AOL did.
The upheavals resulting from momentous technological change are rarely expected.
The telegraph disrupted the postal service.
Radio and television shook up the newspaper industry.
Airplanes ended the age of ocean liners.
Inventions are always dynamic; that is why the future will always be as exciting as the past.
Education Without Borders
LONDON – As the third anniversary of the start of Syria’s civil war approaches, there is a race against time to deliver a groundbreaking education project to the conflict’s hardest-hit victims – hundreds of thousands of child refugees.
A shocking three million Syrian children have now been displaced. More than one million of them have fled Syria and are languishing in camps in neighboring countries, particularly Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
These children are now suffering a third winter away from their homes, schools, and friends.
Many are separated from their families, and thousands more join the ranks of displaced persons every day in what is becoming the largest humanitarian catastrophe of our time.
But a pathbreaking initiative in Lebanon, involving teachers, aid agencies, and education charities has opened a small window of hope.
Amid the chaos of camps, makeshift huts, and destitution, the fight for an important new principle of international aid has begun: even in times of conflict, children must have access to education.
A century and a half ago, the Red Cross established the norm that health care could – and should – be provided even in conflict zones.
This principle was carried forward by groups like Médicins sans Frontières, whose doctors have risked their lives for the last four decades to deliver medical care to the world’s most dangerous places.
Now Lebanon is the site of a pilot program to advance the idea that providing education for refugee children is equally feasible – and no less important.
Across 1,500 communities in this troubled, divided country, where Syrian refugee children now make up 20% of the school-age population, the aim is to establish children’s right to education as a humanitarian priority.
The typical refugee child spends more than ten years away from home.
And every month that a child is out of school makes it less likely that they will ever return.
Three years ago, most Syrian children were at school, and the country had near universal primary education.
Today, millions of children are being denied any chance to realize their talents.
The scars will last for decades.
So, in Syria and the surrounding region, there is already a lost generation in the making: children who are now eight and nine and who have never been to school, children condemned to work as child laborers, and hundreds of girls forced into early marriages.
There are gruesome tales of young people who have been forced to sell their kidneys and other organs simply to survive.
Of course, we must provide food, shelter, and vaccinations.
But, in conflicts like these, the one thing that children need, beyond the material basics, is hope.
And it is education that provides children with hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel – hope that they can plan for the future and prepare for jobs and adulthood.
The pilot project in Lebanon, designed by Kevin Watkins of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Development Institute and led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), creates the opportunity to establish a right to education irrespective of borders.
Indeed, it is designed to cater to all 435,000 Syrian child refugees now in the country.
Thanks to a historic agreement with the Lebanese government, places for hundreds of thousands of children can be created within weeks by putting 1,500 of Lebanon’s schools on a double-shift system.
The scheme is already being piloted in a small village called Akroum in the north of the country.
Lebanese children are taught during the first shift, and Syrian children in the second.
Using the same school for both sets of pupils means that education can be delivered at a cost of only £400 ($670) per child per year.
To secure places for all refugee children, we are seeking $195 million dollars a year for UNICEF and UNHCR, with the plan to be implemented on the ground by NGOs and the Lebanese authorities.
The aim is to secure all funding during March, as the world marks the third anniversary of this tragic exodus from Syria.
We have already assembled a coalition of ten donor countries to take the lead, but we need ten more donors to fund the project fully.
We are appealing to donors not just to create thousands of school places for desperately needy children, but also to establish a precedent for the 20 million other children driven by violent conflict into displaced-persons camps and shantytowns.
There cannot be universal educational opportunity for the worlds’ children without an agreement that we will cater to children in conflict zones.
One million Afghan children are in camps along the border with Pakistan.
Thousands of children in South Sudan still await their first chance to go to school, and schools have yet to be provided for a million more children in the war-torn Central African Republic.
These children’s chances now depend on showing that we can make progress in Lebanon.
The UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, expire in December 2015, which means that time is running to meet the deadline for achieving the target of universal primary education.
That goal will remain unattainable unless and until we establish the long-overdue principle that a child’s right to education knows no boundaries.
One Hundred Days of Servitude
LONDON – Demonstrations around the world were held this week to mark the 100th day of captivity for more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls by the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram.
Since their abduction in April, global outrage has not waned; on the contrary, it has spurred a worldwide movement to uphold all girls’ basic rights.
Campaigners from groups fighting child marriage, child trafficking, and child labor, and from groups demanding children’s right to attend school, free of intimidation, have united in the past few days to show the strength of global opinion in favor of universal education and a world free of child slavery.
But what is of greater long-term significance is that girls themselves are demanding that their rights be taken seriously.
Girls have mobilized in Bangladesh, where the movement to establish child-marriage-free zones is growing; in India, where the Global March Against Child Labor started; and in Africa, where child protection clubs are being formed in almost every country.
The first demand is that the Nigerian girls be returned safely to their homes and that schools in Nigeria are made safer and more secure from threats by Boko Haram (whose name means “Western education is a sin”).
France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and Israel have stepped up military and technical support, including the recent provision of helicopters and night-vision equipment for jungle warfare to fight the group, whose campaign of terror has cost 5,000 deaths in the past five years.
In Nigeria alone, six million girls do not attend school; around the world, ten million girls each year become child brides, and seven million school-age girls are full-time workers.
We can no longer assume steady, if rocky, progress toward vindication of girls’ rights.
Iraqi legislators are considering reducing the age for child marriage to nine.
Pakistan’s Council of Islamic Ideology is calling for all age limits on marriage to be abolished.
And India has passed up another chance to outlaw child labor.
The rising tide of adolescent rage at child marriage and child labor has yet to trend on Twitter and Facebook.
And Bangladesh’s child-marriage-free zone in the Nilphamari region, Indonesia’s child-empowerment groups in the districts of Dompu and Grobogan, Uganda’s child-rights clubs, and India’s Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which combats child slavery, may not be household names.
But the yawning gap between what girls are demanding and the opportunities on offer to them is fueling a liberation struggle led by girls themselves.
Last month, on the “Day of the African Child,” thousands of young people marched on the streets of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and took over 20 African and Asian parliaments to demand universal education for girls.
On July 23, girls took to the streets in Pakistan, led by Baela Raza Jamil of Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi, which is campaigning for what the Nigerian schoolgirls have lost: the right to an education.
In India, vigils making common cause with the Chibok girls were led by Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which every day rescues children from trafficking and slave labor.
Girls Not Brides mobilized in 45 countries, reminding its 145 sister organizations around the world that many of the Chibok girls will meet the same fate as the girls they seek to protect.
Increasingly, young people around the world see the connection between the abductions in Nigeria, the rape and murder of young girls in India, so-called “honor killings” of Pakistani girls who marry against their families’ wishes, genital mutilation of girls across Africa, and child-trafficking for full-time work, often in slave-labor conditions.
Seven decades after the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, girls’ rights are still not taken seriously; so girls are taking action to make themselves heard.
And, slowly but surely, local embryonic civil-rights movements are linking up with global leaders – Girls Not Brides, Walk Free, and A World at School – as part of an emergency coalition to eliminate child labor, child marriage, and educational discrimination against girls.
The timetable for doing so will be set out at the UN General Assembly in September in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Girls should be able to study in a classroom, free of fear and without the need to demonstrate on the streets.
This is a basic right; ensuring that it is respected cannot come soon enough.
Putting Education First
LONDON – For far too long, the cause of universal education has taken a back seat to other great international movements for change.
Now, for two new reasons that lie at the heart of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s launch of the “Education First” initiative, education has returned to its rightful place atop the global policy agenda.
First and foremost, young people have themselves become the biggest advocates of universal education for girls and boys.
Refusing to remain silent while denied opportunity, young people – particularly girls – have launched one of the great civil-rights struggles of our time.
Few could remain unmoved by the brave fight of the young Pakistani girl Malala Yousafzai after the Taliban shot her in the head because she insisted on the right of young girls to an education.
Few have failed to notice the massive public outpouring of support in Pakistan and elsewhere for the cause that she is championing.
Likewise, we have also seen in recent months the creation by schoolgirls in Bangladesh of child-marriage-free zones, aimed at defending the right of girls to stay in school instead of being married off as teenage brides against their will.
In India, the Global March Against Child Labor, led by the children’s rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi, has rescued thousands of young boys and girls from a life of slavery in factories, workshops, and domestic service, and has ensured that they return to school.
These demonstrations by girls and boys demanding their right to education have made the fight for basic schooling impossible to ignore.
Consequently, every government now feels under even greater pressure to deliver the second of the global Millennium Development Goals (“achieve universal primary education”) by the end of 2015.
But a second worldwide force also has propelled education to the center of the policy agenda in most countries: the increased recognition of the importance of education by those who examine why countries succeed or fail.
For years, academics have debated whether culture, institutions, ideology, or resources cause some countries to lag behind.
Today, a growing number of writers, researchers, and policymakers see the crucial link between education and national economic success.
The deployment of human capital has become an important factor in explaining why some countries remain stuck in a “middle-income trap” and why others cannot break out of low-income status.
And research assessing a country’s human capital now focuses on the quantity and quality of basic skills, qualified graduate manpower, and expertise in research and development.
Putting education first is urgent in view of the scale of wasted talent and potential worldwide.
Some 57 million children still do not go to school, 500 million girls will never finish the secondary education to which they are entitled, and 750 million adults remain illiterate.
The link between education and economic success makes the delivery of quality schooling and training a hugely important issue for business as well.
By 2020, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, we will face the twin problems of a shortfall of up to 40 million high-skill workers and a surplus of up to 95 million low-skill workers.
By 2030, the global workforce of 3.5 billion will include an estimated one billion workers who lack a secondary education, significantly hindering their countries’ economic prospects.
As a result, without urgent action, businesses are likely to face a huge skills shortage, especially in emerging markets and developing countries, where most economic activity will be concentrated.
Indeed, the adult illiteracy rate in Somalia is 63%, and 39% in Nigeria; in South Sudan, more girls die during childbirth than complete primary school.
Unless we act, by mid-century the global economy will be characterized by massive waste of talent and unequal opportunities.
According to new figures from the Wittgenstein Center’s forthcoming book World Population and Human Capital in the 21st Century, only 3% of young adults in Mali and Mozambique are projected to have a tertiary education in 2050; the expected proportion is just 4% in Niger, Liberia, Rwanda, and Chad, and only 5% in Malawi and Madagascar.
While the projection for North America as a whole is 60%, the forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa is 16%.
Such figures reveal a world divided between those who have and those who lack educational opportunity, with huge potential repercussions not only in terms of skill shortages and economic waste, but also in terms of social stability.
The late US Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren’s words in Brown v. Board of Education,which struck down the legal basis for racial segregation in America’s public schools, remain no less relevant today: “It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.”
As Warren put it, “Such an opportunity…is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.”
We have little more than two years to turn basic education from a privilege for some into a right for all.
Secretary-General Ban and I are determined that every day until that deadline in December 2015, we will work as hard as possible to ensure every child is in school.
Gordon Gekko Reborn
NEW YORK – In the 1987 film Wall Street, the character Gordon Gekko famously declared, “Greed is good.”
His creed became the ethos of a decade of corporate and financial-sector excesses that ended in the late 1980’s collapse of the junk-bond market and the Savings &amp; Loan crisis.
Gekko himself was packed off to prison.
A generation later, the sequel to Wall Street – to be released next month – sees Gekko released from jail and returned to the financial world.
His reappearance comes just as the credit bubble fueled by the sub-prime mortgage boom is about to burst, triggering the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.
The “Greed is good” mentality is a regular feature of financial crises.
But were the traders and bankers of the sub-prime saga more greedy, arrogant, and immoral than the Gekkos of the 1980’s?
Not really, because greed and amorality in financial markets have been common throughout the ages.
Teaching morality and values in business schools will not tame such behavior, but changing the incentives that reward short-term profits and lead bankers and traders to take excessive risks will.
The bankers and traders of the latest crisis responded rationally to compensation and bonus schemes that allowed them to assume a lot of leverage and ensured large bonuses, but that were almost guaranteed to bankrupt a large number of financial institutions in the end.
To avoid such excesses, it is not enough to rely on better regulation and supervision, for three reasons:
·        Smart and greedy bankers and traders will always find ways to circumvent new rules;
·        CEOs and boards of directors of financial firms – let alone regulators and supervisors – cannot effectively monitor the risks and behaviors of thousands of separate profit and loss centers in a firm, as each trader and banker is a separate P&amp;L with its own capital at risk;
·        CEOs and boards are themselves subject to major conflicts of interest, because they don’t represent the true interest of their firms’ ultimate shareholders.
As a result, any reform of regulation and supervision will fail to control bubbles and excesses unless several other fundamental aspects of the financial system are changed.
First, compensation schemes must be radically altered through regulation, as banks will not do it themselves for fear of losing talented people to competitors.
In particular, bonuses based on medium-term results of risky trades and investments must supplant bonuses based on short-term outcomes.
Second, repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking, was a mistake.
The old model of private partnerships – in which partners had an incentive to monitor each other to avoid reckless investments – gave way to one of public companies aggressively competing with each other and with commercial banks to achieve ever-rising profitability, which was achievable only with reckless levels of leverage.
Similarly, the move from a lending model of “originate and hold” to one of “originate and distribute” based on securitization led to a massive transfer of risk.
No player but the last in the securitization chain was exposed to the ultimate credit risk; the rest simply raked in high fees and commissions.
Third, financial markets and financial firms have become a nexus of conflicts of interest that must be unwound.
These conflicts are inbuilt, because firms that engage in commercial banking, investment banking, proprietary trading, market making and dealing, insurance, asset management, private equity, hedge-fund activities, and other services are on every side of every deal (the recent case of Goldman Sachs was just the tip of the iceberg).
There are also massive agency problems in the financial system, because principals (such as shareholders) cannot properly monitor the actions of agents (CEOs, managers, traders, bankers) that pursue their own interest.
Moreover, the problem is not just that long-term shareholders are shafted by greedy short-term agents; even the shareholders have agency problems.
If financial institutions do not have enough capital, and shareholders don’t have enough of their own skin in the game, they will push CEOs and bankers to take on too much leverage and risks, because their own net worth is not at stake.
At the same time, there is a double agency problem, as the ultimate shareholders – individual shareholders – don’t directly control boards and CEOs.
These shareholders are represented by institutional investors (pension funds, etc.) whose interests, agendas, and cozy relationships often align them more closely with firms’ CEOs and managers.
Thus, repeated financial crises are also the result of a failed system of corporate governance.
Fourth, greed cannot be controlled by any appeal to morality and values.
Greed has to be controlled by fear of loss, which derives from knowledge that the reckless institutions and agents will not be bailed out.
The systematic bailouts of the latest crisis – however necessary to avoid a global meltdown – worsened this moral-hazard problem.
Not only were “too big to fail” financial institutions bailed out, but the distortion has become worse as these institutions have become – via financial-sector consolidation – even bigger.
If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big and should be broken up.
Unless we make these radical reforms, new Gordon Gekkos – and Charles Ponzis – will emerge.
For each chastised and born-again Gekko – as the Gekko in the new Wall Street is – hundreds of meaner and greedier ones will be born.
Partnership or Putsch?
EUGENE – In 2010, I sat across the table from Assistant US Trade Representative Barbara Weisel, who was responsible for negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the mega-regional free-trade treaty among Vietnam, Malaysia, and ten other Pacific Rim countries that President Barack Obama’s administration wants to conclude in the coming weeks.
At the time, I was Senior Policy Adviser for the US House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and Labor – a position that made me the top congressional staff member responsible for upholding labor standards in international trade treaties.
The purpose of the meeting was for Congress to understand what steps the Obama administration was taking to protect American workers from being forced into unfair competition with workers from low-wage trading partners.
I asked Weisel what I thought was a simple question: “What is the White House’s position on democracy?”
Weisel claimed not to understand, so I explained: A majority of congressional Democrats supported the principle that the United States should sign trade agreements only with countries that are democracies.
Other democracies feel the same way.
For example, trade agreements negotiated by members of the Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth) contain just such a provision.
The logic is obvious: If we in developed democracies had lacked the right to protest, speak out, organize unions, and vote for representatives of our choosing, we would never have ended child labor or established the eight-hour workday.
Having used these rights to raise our own living standards, we should not now put developed countries’ workers in direct competition with workers who lack the basic freedoms needed to improve their own conditions.
But my explanation did not help.
Weisel stated simply that “we have no position” on democracy.
I pressed her on how the White House planned to deal with, for example, Vietnam – a country where children as young as 14 are forced to work 12-hour days, and where there is no right to free speech, no right to protest, no right to strike, and no freedom of association.
“Oh, you can have labor rights without democracy,” Weisel insisted.
She demurred when asked to name an example.
In reality, the one thing that non-democratic regimes can never tolerate is independent workers’ organizations.
That is why trade unionists were the first through the gates of Dachau, and why Poland’s Solidarity movement posed an existential threat to Communist power throughout the former Soviet bloc.
Indeed, part of international investors’ attraction to countries like Vietnam and China is not simply that wages are low, but that the absence of democratic rights promises to lock in cheap labor for years to come.
For example, when China revised its labor law in 2008, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and other members of the US-China Business Council lobbied successfully to limit the expansion of Chinese workers’ rights.
While China is not a party to the current negotiations, the TPP is designed to allow additional countries to sign on in the future – and the Chinese, we can assume, will be courted assiduously.
Former US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, for one, noted that he “would love nothing more” than to see China join the treaty.
But the TPP is not really a “trade” treaty at all.
Rather, it is a vehicle for corporate lobbyists to achieve what they have been unable to persuade legislators to support through normal means.
For example, pharmaceutical companies have insisted that the TPP force all countries to grant 12-year patents on prescription drugs – increasing their profits while delaying competition from cheaper generic versions.
Likewise, tobacco companies are seeking to use the TPP to prohibit developing countries – which represent the largest cigarette markets – from adopting new controls on their products.
The TPP’s most controversial provision, if adopted, would allow private corporations to sue foreign governments for adopting policies that adversely affect their expected profits.
For example, if Vietnam were to mandate six weeks of paid maternity leave for all employees, a foreign factory owner might sue the government, insisting that it either repeal the law or reimburse the company for the cost of providing this benefit.
A private tribunal would hear cases and issue binding rulings, with no possibility of appeal to any court or other democratically accountable authority.
This, then, is the future that the TPP holds out: a kind of Potemkin democracy, in which citizens are free to choose their flags and holidays but cannot afford to enact any laws that might reduce international investors’ profits.
Workers’ wages in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other developed countries would be inexorably competed down toward those of lower-wage trading partners, while developing-country workers would find it increasingly difficult – even in nominal democracies – to improve their standard of living.
The TPP is being crafted in utmost secrecy, with even legislators unable to see the full text that is being negotiated, though corporate lobbyists have been treated as partners in the drafting process.
This is not surprising: In the US, where almost five million manufacturing jobs have disappeared since the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and where real wages have stagnated, a majority of voters across the political spectrum are opposed to more such treaties.
At least for the Obama administration, the rush to conclude the TPP negotiations is doubtless driven by the desire to close the deal well ahead of America’s midterm election in November.
And that, too, is bad for democracy.
Indeed, though the US Constitution stipulates that the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations” lies solely in the hands of Congress, the Obama administration is pressing legislators to approve so-called fast-track authority, under which they would have no say over either the TPP’s terms or the parties to it – or even the power to amend the treaty text in any way.
As a political scientist, I am sometimes asked how it is possible for democracies to enact laws that run counter to the interests of the vast majority of voters.
They do so, in part, by shunning any commitment to democracy itself.
There is no clearer example of this than the TPP, which almost certainly constitutes the single biggest threat to the preservation – or creation – of any signatory country’s middle class.
Restoring Yesterday\u0027s Hope for Tomorrow\u0027s World
WASHINGTON, DC – The year 2015 was difficult, punctuated by declining growth forecasts, horrific terror attacks, massive refugee flows, and serious political challenges, with populism on the rise in many countries.
In the Middle East, in particular, chaos and violence has continued to proliferate, with devastating consequences.
This represents a disappointing turn from the undoubtedly flawed, but far more hopeful world of just a few decades ago.
In his autobiography The World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change.
Born in 1881 in Vienna, Zweig spent his youth in an optimistic, civil, and tolerant environment.
Then, starting in 1914, he witnessed Europe’s collapse into World War I, followed by revolutionary convulsions, the Great Depression, the rise of Stalinism, and finally the barbarism of Nazism and the outbreak of World War II.
Devastated, Zweig committed suicide while in exile in 1942.
One imagines that Zweig would have been comforted by the post-WWII creation of the United Nations and the Bretton-Woods system, not to mention the subsequent decades of reconstruction and reconciliation.
He could have witnessed the cooperation and progress that marked the post-war era.
Perhaps, then, he would have looked at the period from 1914 to 1945 as a terrible but limited detour in the world’s march toward peace and prosperity.
Of course, the second half of the twentieth century was far from perfect.
Until 1990, peace was secured largely by the threat of mutual nuclear destruction.
Local conflicts, such as in Korea, Vietnam, parts of Africa, and the Middle East, took their toll.
And while about 100 developing countries gained independence, the process was not always peaceful.
At the same time, however, the world economy grew more rapidly than ever.
A strong middle class emerged in the advanced countries, and then began to appear elsewhere.
The Western democracies and Japan built economies in which productivity growth led to shared prosperity; governments engaged in regulation and redistribution, while private companies fueled growth by implementing technologically advanced production methods.
On both the regional and global levels, decisive progress was made in reaping the benefits from trade and economies of scale.
The European integration project seemed to herald a new kind of cooperation, which could extend to other regions and even influence global cooperation.
The generation that came of age in the 1960s felt much like Zweig had felt in his youth.
We believed that, though progress may not be linear, we could count on it.
We expected an increasingly peaceful and tolerant world, in which technological advances, together with well-governed markets, would generate ever-expanding prosperity.
In 1989, when the Soviet Union was poised to collapse and China was shifting to a market-based economy, Francis Fukuyama announced the “end of history.”
Over the last two decades, however, our hopes – political, social, and economic – have been repeatedly dashed.
There was a time when US policymakers were wondering whether Russia should join NATO.
That possibility is difficult even to consider today, after Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea (apparently carried out in response to fears that Ukraine would deepen its ties with the European Union and NATO).
Many emerging economies achieved rapid growth for years – even decades – enabling billions of people to escape extreme poverty and reducing the wealth gap between developed and developing countries.
But that growth has lately slowed substantially, leading many to question whether economists spoke too soon when we labeled them the new engines of global economic growth.
Likewise, the Arab Spring in 2011 was supposed to herald a new, more democratic future for the Middle East and North Africa.
While Tunisia has averted disaster, most of the other affected countries have ended up mired in chaos, with Syria’s brutal civil war facilitating the rise of the Islamic State.
The euro, meanwhile, suffered its own crisis.
The common currency, once portrayed as the start of a quasi-federal Europe, instead created serious tension between “creditor” and “debtor” countries when many debtors faced a protracted economic downturn.
Just as Europe seemed finally to be escaping the euro crisis, refugees, especially from Syria, began flooding in.
That has jeopardized the Schengen Area of borderless travel, and some are asking whether the EU can withstand the pressure.
In the United States, the Syrian refugee crisis has led Congress to rush to restrict visa-free entrance for tourists from 38 countries.
This comes at a time when income and wealth inequality is skyrocketing in the US – the median wage for men has not increased in decades – leaving many to wonder whether their children will be able to maintain the living standard they enjoyed.
On top of all this, for the first time in decades, the growth of international trade no longer comfortably exceeds the growth of global output.
A fundamental driver of many of these problems may well be the unprecedented speed of change – driven by globalization and technological innovation – which has produced disruptions too quickly and on too large a scale for us to manage.
For example, while communication technology has done wonders, say, to expand access to finance in Africa, it has also enabled terrorist networks to encrypt their communications effectively.
And as the global financial crisis starkly demonstrated, regulators have struggled to keep pace with financial innovation.
The potential for human progress still seems immense, because the world wants for neither resources nor technological innovation.
Indeed, technology offers the hope of lifesaving medical treatments, higher economic productivity, and sustainable energy systems.
But people are fearful, as shown by the return of identity politics and a lack of economic and political inclusiveness.
As a result, productivity growth is slowing, and, though capital seems cheap and profits plentiful, investment remains sluggish.
The key to managing the disruptions and assuaging people’s fears is governance.
Zweig saw the world fall apart a century ago not because human knowledge stopped advancing, but because of widespread governance and policy failures.
As we enter 2016, we must focus on adapting governance, in all of its economic and political dimensions, to the twenty-first century, so that our resources and knowledge produce inclusive progress, not violent conflict.
The Good-Governance Trap
ROME – Development and improved governance have tended to go hand in hand.
But, contrary to popular belief, there is little evidence that success in implementing governance reforms leads to more rapid and inclusive economic and social development.
In fact, it may be the other way around.
The focus on good governance stems from the struggle to restore sustained growth during the developing-country debt crises of the 1980s.
Instead of reassessing the prevailing economic-policy approach, international development institutions took aim at the easy targets: developing-country governments.
Advising those governments on how to do their jobs became a new vocation for these institutions, which quickly developed new “technical” approaches to governance reform.
The World Bank, using well over 100 indicators, introduced a composite index of good governance, based on perceptions of voice and accountability, political stability and the absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, the rule of law, and levels of corruption.
By claiming that it had found a strong correlation between its governance indicators and economic performance, the Bank fueled hope that the key to economic progress had been found.
The case was flawed from the beginning.
The indicators used were ahistorical and failed to account for country-specific challenges and conditions, with cross-country statistical analyses suffering from selection bias and ignoring the interlinkages among a wide array of variables.
As a result, the World Bank badly overestimated the impact of governance reform on economic growth.
To be sure, governance that is effective, legitimate, and responsive provides untold benefits, especially when compared to the alternative: inefficient governance, cronyism, and corruption.
But the focus on governance reform has not proved nearly as effective as promised in fostering development.
In fact, this governance-focused approach may have actually undermined development efforts.
For starters, it has allowed international institutions to avoid acknowledging the shortcomings of the new development orthodoxy of the last two decades of the twentieth century, when Latin America lost over a decade, and Sub-Saharan Africa a quarter-century, of economic and social progress.
It has also complicated the work of governments unnecessarily.
With good-governance reforms now a condition for international aid, developing-country governments often end up mimicking donor expectations, instead of addressing the issues that are most pressing for their own citizens.
Indeed, such reforms can even undermine traditional rights and customary obligations worked out among communities over many generations.
Moreover, the required reforms are so wide-ranging that they are beyond the means of most developing countries to implement.
As a result, good-governance solutions tend to distract from more effective development efforts.
Another problem with governance reforms is that, although they are formally neutral, they often favor particular vested interests, with grossly unfair consequences.
Reforms aimed at decentralization and devolution have, in some cases, enabled the rise of powerful local political patrons.
The conclusion is clear: the development agenda should not be overloaded with governance reform.
As Harvard’s Merilee Grindle has put it, we should be aiming for “good enough” governance, selecting a few imperatives from a long list of possibilities.
But selecting the most important measures will not be easy.
Indeed, advocates of governance reform have rarely been right about the most effective approach.
Consider the unrelenting promotion of efforts to strengthen property rights.
Absent alienable individual ownership of productive resources, it is asserted, there will be insufficient means and incentives to pursue development initiatives, and shared resources (the “commons”) will be over-exploited and used inefficiently.
In reality, the so-called “tragedy of the commons” is neither ubiquitous nor inevitable, and individual property rights are not always the best – and never the only – institutional solution for dealing with social dilemmas.
The late Elinor Ostrom, a Nobel laureate in economics, showed that human societies have built myriad creative and lasting solutions to resolve a wide range of dilemmas involving the use of common resources.
The theme of good governance has special appeal to large bureaucratic organizations like multilateral development banks and UN agencies, which favor apolitical solutions to what are essentially political problems.
In other words, good governance is an ostensibly technocratic answer to what donors and other well-meaning international groups consider bad policies and, especially, bad politics.
Herein lies the real problem with the good-governance agenda: it supposes that the solution to most policy and political dilemmas lies in compliance with a set of formal process-oriented indicators.
But experience over two decades shows that such directives provide little practical guidance for solving the technically, socially, and politically complex real-world problems of economic development.
Recognizing that governance improves with development, the international community would be better served by pursuing reforms that directly advance development, instead of a broad agenda that may have, at best, a small indirect impact.
Such a pragmatic approach to improving governance would be neither dogmatic nor pretend to universality.
Instead, the major constraints would be identified, analyzed, and addressed, perhaps sequentially.
Many of the good-governance agenda’s key goals – empowerment, inclusion, participation, integrity, transparency, and accountability – can be built into workable solutions, not because outsiders demand them, but because effective solutions require them.
Such solutions should draw from relevant experiences, with the understanding that they do not amount to “best practices.”
The blind pursuit of good governance has guided development efforts for too long.
It is time to acknowledge what works – and disregard what does not.
Reengineering Government
PARIS – Since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, governments in advanced countries have been under significant pressure.
In many countries, tax receipts abruptly collapsed when the economy contracted, income dwindled, and real-estate transactions came to a halt.
The fall in tax revenues was in most cases sudden, deep, and lasting.
Governments had no choice but to raise taxes or to adjust to leaner times.
In some countries, the magnitude of the shock was such that a large tax increase could not fill the gap.
In Spain, despite tax hikes worth more than 4% of GDP since 2010, the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 38% in 2014, compared to 41% in 2007.
In Greece, tax increases amounted to 13% of GDP during the same period, but the tax ratio increased by only six percentage points.
Elsewhere, political limits to tax increases were reached before the gap could be filled.
Willingly or not, priority is being given to spending cuts.
Disillusion about future growth adds to the pressure.
The productivity record has generally been weak over the last few years, and this suggests that growth in the years ahead could be slower than previously expected.
Revenue growth thus looks insufficient to match the surge in age-related public spending on health and pensions.
This is a very different crisis from those experienced in the 1980s and the 1990s.
Back then, the main issue was political: the legitimacy and efficiency of public spending was under attack.
In the words of US President Ronald Reagan, government was the problem, not the solution.
The state, it was loudly proclaimed, had to be rolled back.
By contrast, today’s concerns are economic.
Partisan disagreement about the proper scope of government remains, but there is no overall rejection of state intervention.
Often, it is not interests or ideologies that make public spending cuts unavoidable – just facts.
How can governments rise to the challenge?
The risk they face is clear enough: absent a profound reengineering, inertial spending – owing to entitlements and civil-service wages – is bound to crowd out spending on new priorities and new policies.
Already, the countries that have been forced to cut the most have generally sacrificed public infrastructure investment.
Research is another area at risk.
Social investment in programs that pay off over the long term, such as pre-school child care, is suffering from financial constraints.
National security is not given the priority it deserves, despite growing threats.
Last but not least, makeshift solutions such as protracted wage freezes may eventually erode the quality of public services.
Fortunately, there are a few things governments can do to mitigate the effects of inertial spending.
For starters, they can simply systematize evaluations of the efficiency of public money.
In most countries, such assessments are still rare and haphazard: Parliaments often enact policies without knowing whether they are worth the money, and it may take a very long time before ineffective or inefficient policies are terminated.
That is why enabling legislation for spending programs should contain sunset clauses, with extensions subject to independent evaluation.
Second, spending reviews, too, should be systematized.
Setting priorities – whether to spend more on education and less on pensions, for example, or whether to invest in infrastructure or in research – entails hard choices that should be made explicit.
In an ideal world, these choices would be the focus of electoral debates and parliamentary work.
But behind every budget line is a constituency tempting policymakers to eschew hard decisions.
That is why structured spending reviews are useful: they force officials to bridge the gap between ends and means and encourage informed democratic decision-making.
Third, governments should equip themselves with a reengineering budget.
As private companies know, transformations – deep changes in the way things are done – often cost money before they bring savings.
This may be because the changes require investment in new technology, retraining of employees, or simply buying stakeholders’ consent.
Money earmarked in the budget for such reengineering of government programs would be a good investment.
Fourth, governments should promote public-sector innovation.
Contrary to popular prejudice, local governments and public agencies do innovate; what is missing is a mechanism to select and disseminate innovations in the same way the market selects new products or cost-saving processes.
A better way to deliver a public service may remain unknown for years.
That might well change if governments took simple steps like allocating more funding on a project basis and organizing contests.
For example, schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods should be allowed to tender for funds for educational innovation.
Last but not least, people should be empowered.
Citizens want a more nimble state that tailors its operations to local needs.
In the digital age, they want it to meet new standards of speed, reliability, and personalization.
They increasingly challenge the traditional view that efficiency and equality imply less individual choice.
And they want the government to be open, to guarantee access to data, and to make its efficiency and effectiveness directly observable.
These are powerful forces for change, and embattled governments should harness them to the goal of achieving the reengineering they so urgently need.
The alternative is to accept the deterioration of the quality of public services, which would lead only to a loss of government legitimacy and, with it, a diminishing willingness to pay taxes.
Beyond the Revolving Door
LONDON – “Honestly,” said Bill Gates during the COP21 meeting in Paris earlier this month, “I’ve been a bit surprised that the climate talks historically haven’t had R&D on the agenda in any way, shape, or form.”
So am I, and the question Gates raises goes to the heart of the relationship between business and government in solving our societies’ toughest problems, from ensuring the planet’s continued habitability to fostering stable and inclusive economic growth.
To be sure, in some areas, government authorities simply don’t consider making business a part of the solution early on.
The most striking recent example is the ongoing refugee crisis: Governments in Europe and around the world still don’t fully include business in early-stage thinking about how to manage the flow of asylum-seekers.
Granted, in many cases business leaders have chosen to remain on the sideline; but both they and governments need to adjust their thinking.
But in other areas, companies are more than eager to step up, be seen and heard, and exercise influence.
When it comes to technology, R&D, trade talks, and the like, the benefit for companies’ bottom line is direct and clear, and here Gates’ surprise is understandable, because corporate leaders typically lobby to participate and change the way governments think and act.
And yet dangers arise when business gets too close to government.
Sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “revolving door” between government and business, through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again.
It is a cycle that often resembles the fox guarding the henhouse, with those who regulate too close to those whom they regulate.
The most obvious example of this is finance and banking, where former employees of a single firm, Goldman Sachs, hold some of the most senior regulatory and monetary positions – and not just in the United States.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank was Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, worked for Goldman Sachs for 13 years.
But simply closing the revolving door in finance is not a solution.
Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has shown that regulation and legislation in this area must strike a balance, lest it undermine “the ability of regulatory agencies to seek and retain talent.”
In areas like defense, the revolving door moves swiftly.
According to the Boston Globe, from 2004 through 2008, some four-fifths of retiring three- and four-star US generals went to work as consultants or defense executives.
Likewise, the US-based group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics has shown the extent to which careers lead from the US Department of Defense to the defense industry.
Corporate scandals often reveal where business and government are too close for comfort, as when senior members of Toshiba’s executive team and board, for example, sit on Japanese government panels and commissions.
Likewise, Volkswagen’s close relationship with the German government has led to accusations that regulators went easy on the company, setting the stage for the emissions-testing scandal in which the carmaker is now embroiled.
But close ties between business and government are also necessary.
Strong economies need strong businesses and strong trade, and that requires good relationships with policymakers.
When government officials travel abroad to encourage economic cooperation, CEOs of some of the country’s biggest companies should go along.
The question is whether such companies are so important to the country’s economy and reputation that the government cannot regulate them properly.
They are given excessive leeway because they, like many financial firms, are too important to fail.
This complex dance between business and government is never-ending and always evolving.
It is the stuff of gatherings like the World Economic Forum, where business leaders and governments talk tough on panels and make nice in back rooms.
And the need to do both has become more obvious than ever in an era of slow economic growth and privatization of services once provided by the public sector.
The working relationship is important and should not be condemned, but it must be recognized openly.
This brings us back to Gates, who announced in Paris an initiative to spend a total of $20 billion on climate-related R&D over the next five years.
Gates’ plan highlights a frequently noted component of the relationship between government and business: governments’ vital role in funding early experimental research, which business then often turns into commercially viable solutions.
All of this is necessary to build stronger economies.
But, though Gates was right to ask why climate-change negotiations have not included R&D, let’s not pretend that any of this is simple.
The need for revolving doors, whether of personnel or ideas, between government and business cannot be a reason to allow companies to gain undue influence on public policy or for regulators to be kept weak.
Nor can it be a reason to give failing businesses a safety net for their own bad behavior or poor decisions.
This is especially true at a time when public trust is at a low ebb.
Rather than pretending that this symbiotic relationship doesn’t exist or, worse, that it isn’t necessary, both business and government must err on the side of transparency.
As Gates’ question made clear, in our fear of allowing the relationship to go too far, we risk not allowing it to go far enough.
Innovate or Stagnate
DUBAI – Companies, like people, grow old.
They start life small and eager to survive, fueled by youthful energy and fresh ideas.
They compete, expand, mature, and eventually, with few exceptions, fade into obscurity.
The same is true of governments: they, too, can lose the hunger and ambition of youth and allow themselves to become complacent.
Consider this: only 11% of the Fortune 500 companies from 1955 still exist today, while the average time that companies stay in the top 500 has fallen from 75 years to 15 years.
In this age of rapid change, those who lag behind become irrelevant– in a heartbeat.
Countries whose governments grow old face the same fate as outdated companies.
Their choice is simple: innovate or become irrelevant.
The race for national competitiveness is every bit as fierce as the competition among companies in the marketplace.
Countries compete for investment, talent, growth, and opportunity in a globalized world, and those that are pushed out of the running surrender the greatest prize of all: human development, prosperity, and happiness for their people.
To avoid this fate, governments must focus on what really matters: how to be like the 11% of companies that have remained, through the decades, in the top 500.
The lifecycle of companies should teach governments that the secret of eternal youth is constant innovation – seizing opportunities and behaving like the dynamic, entrepreneurial companies that are defining today’s world and shaping its future.
The key to corporations’ rejuvenation, civilizations’ evolution, and human development in general is simple: innovation.
I am always amazed when governments think they are an exception to this rule.
Innovation in government is not an intellectual luxury, a topic confined to seminars and panel discussions, or a matter only of administrative reforms.
It is the recipe for human survival and development, the fuel for constant progress, and the blueprint for a country’s rise.
The first key to business-like innovation in government is a focus on skills.
Top-tier companies continuously invest in their employees to provide them with the right skills for the marketplace.
Governments must do the same, by constantly upgrading skills and nurturing innovation – among their own employees, across key sectors of the economy, and at the foundations of the education system.
Governments that fail to equip new generations with the skills needed to become leaders for their time are condemning them to be led by other, more innovative societies.
A United States Department of Labor study found that 65% of children currently in primary school will grow up to work in jobs that do not exist today.
Another study at Oxford University found that 47% of job categories are at high risk of ceasing to exist because they can be automated through technology.
So, how do we prepare our children and future generations for such times?
How do we equip our countries to compete, not only today, but in the coming decades as well?
The answer lies in honing our children’s creativity, and providing them with the analytical and communication skills needed to channel it toward productive ends.
The second key to transforming governments into engines of innovation is to shift the balance of investment toward intangibles, as in the private sector.
Whereas more than 80% of the value of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 consisted of tangible assets 40 years ago, today that ratio is reversed: more than 80% of the largest companies’ value is intangible – the knowledge and skills of their employees and the intellectual property embedded in their products.
Governments, too, should think strategically about shifting their spending away from tangible infrastructure like roads and buildings, and toward intangibles like education and research and development.
It is no secret that the US and Europe, combined, spend more than $250 billion of public funds annually on R&amp;D to maintain their leading positions.
Likewise, a key driver of rapid development in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea has been their strategic decision to shift public expenditure away from hard infrastructure and toward the “soft” infrastructure needed to build and sustain a knowledge economy.
Likewise, the British government spends markedly more of its budget on such intangibles than on tangible assets.
Most of today’s transformative companies are well known for having an innovative corporate culture and working environment that inspires and empowers employees.
Governments that set an example for innovation have the power to implant a nationwide culture of creativity.
When such a culture takes root, people feel inspired to run further with their ideas, to aim higher with their ambitions, and to pursue bigger dreams.
That is how countries that encourage innovation take the lead – and stay there.
To sustain innovation, businesses must attract and retain the most creative and productive minds.
In this age of global mobility, countries, too, go head to head in the battle for talent.
Global cities compete to provide an ideal life and work environment for innovators, and to harness their creativity to become stronger and more competitive still.
Innovative governments do the same thing on a national scale.
They attract talent, perform efficiently, and continually upgrade their systems and services.
They empower citizens to cultivate their collective energy and develop their potential, and thus become drivers of their countries’ growth and advancement in the world arena.
Above all, they value human minds and help people become better guardians and builders of our planet.
For governments, innovation is an existential question.
Only those that sustain innovation can drive change in the world, because they are the governments that never grow old.
The rates are bounded by concerns about inflation, over-expansion of the state sector, and the central bank’s independence; but, with our relatively low levels of debt (Japan’s debt amounts to over 230% of its GDP) and depressed output and inflation, these limits are quite distant in the UK and the US.
Fraud, Fools, and Financial Markets
NEW HAVEN – Adam Smith famously wrote of the “invisible hand,” by which individuals’ pursuit of self-interest in free, competitive markets advances the interest of society as a whole.
And Smith was right: Free markets have generated unprecedented prosperity for individuals and societies alike. But, because we can be manipulated or deceived or even just passively tempted, free markets also persuade us to buy things that are good neither for us nor for society.
This observation represents an important codicil to Smith’s vision. And it is one that George Akerlof and I explore in our new book, Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception.
Most of us have suffered “phishing”: unwanted emails and phone calls designed to defraud us.
A “phool” is anyone who does not fully comprehend the ubiquity of phishing.
A phool sees isolated examples of phishing, but does not appreciate the extent of professionalism devoted to it, nor how deeply this professionalism affects lives.
Sadly, a lot of us have been phools – including Akerlof and me, which is why we wrote this book.
Routine phishing can affect any market, but our most important observations concern financial markets – timely enough, given the massive boom in the equity and real-estate markets since 2009, and the turmoil in global asset markets since last month.
As too many optimists have learned to their detriment, asset prices are highly volatile, and a whole ocean of phishes is involved.
Borrowers are lured into unsuitable mortgages; firms are stripped of their assets; accountants mislead investors; financial advisers spin narratives of riches from nowhere; and the media promote extravagant claims.
But the losers in the downturns are not just those who have been duped.
A chain of additional losses occurs when the inflated assets have been purchased with borrowed money.
In that case, bankruptcies and fear of bankruptcy spawn an epidemic of further bankruptcies, reinforcing fear.
Then credit dries up and the economy collapses. This vicious downward spiral for business confidence typically features phishes – for example, the victims of Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme – discovered only after the period of irrational exuberance has ended.
Epidemics, in economics as much as in medicine, call for an immediate and drastic response.
The response by the authorities to the Great Crash of 1929 was small and slow, and the world economy entered a “Dark Age” that lasted through the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War.
The 2007-2009 financial crisis portended a similar outcome, but this time the world’s governments and central banks intervened promptly, in a coordinated fashion, and with an appropriately high volume of stimulus.
The recovery has been weak; but we are nowhere near a new Dark Age.
For that we should be grateful.
Yet some now argue that the fiscal and monetary authorities should not have responded so quickly or strongly when the 2007-2009 crisis erupted.
They believe that the primary cause of the crisis was what economists call moral hazard: because risk-takers expected that the authorities would intervene to protect them when their bets went awry, they took even greater risks.
By contrast, our view (supported by plenty of data) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance, aided and abetted by phishes.
The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).
Such possibilities were a marginal consideration in the euphoria preceding the 2007-2009 crisis: those selling at inflated prices were making profits; and buyers “knew” they were doing the right thing – even when they weren’t.
The reluctance to acknowledge the need for immediate intervention in a financial crisis is based on a school of economics that fails to account for the irrational exuberance that I have explored elsewhere, and that ignores the aggressive marketing and other realities of digital-age markets examined in Phishing for Phools.
But adhering to an approach that overlooks these factors is akin to doing away with fire departments, on the grounds that without them people would be more careful – and so there would then be no fires.
We found out many years ago, to the world’s great regret, what happens when a financial epidemic is allowed to run its course.
Our analysis indicates that not only are there endemic and natural forces that make the financial system highly volatile; but also that swift, effective intervention is needed in the face of financial collapse.
We need to give free rein to fiscal and monetary authorities to take aggressive steps when financial turmoil turns into financial crisis.
One Dark Age is one too many.
The Creative State
LONDON – The conventional view in mainstream economics today is that governments have little capacity to spark innovation.
The state should play as limited a role in the economy as possible, the thinking goes, intervening only in cases of “market failure.”
This is far from the truth.
In fact, governments can and do play a critical role in spurring innovation – actively creating new markets, instead of just fixing them.
To be sure, advocates of a limited economic role for government believe that market failure justifies some funding of infrastructure and basic science.
But such limited intervention can hardly explain the billions of public-sector dollars that have flowed toward downstream applied research, even providing early-stage financing for companies.
Indeed, in some of the world’s most famous innovation hubs, the state has played a key “entrepreneurial” role, envisioning and financing the creation of entire new fields, from information technology to biotech, nanotech, and green tech.
In Silicon Valley, for example, the government has acted as a strategic investor through a decentralized network of public institutions: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, NASA, the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR), and the National Science Foundation.
The sums involved can be staggering, and not just in IT; large amounts of funding have also been channeled to energy and life sciences.
In 2011, for instance, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) invested $31 billion in biomedical research.
Marcia Angell, a professor at Harvard Medical School, has shown that this financing played a crucial role in the development of some of the most revolutionary new drugs in recent decades.
Similarly, for some of the most innovative American companies, financing from the SBIR has proved to be more important than private venture capital.
Examples outside the US include Israel, where the public venture-capital fund Yozma has provided early-stage funding to some of the country’s most dynamic companies, and Finland, where Sitra, the public innovation fund, supplied early financing for Nokia.
In China, the state-owned development bank is offering billions of dollars in loans to some of the country’s most innovative companies, including Huawei and Yingli Solar.
These types of public investments are critical in creating and shaping new markets.
Indeed, government investment played a central role in developing nearly all of the technologies that make the iPhone a smart phone: the Internet, GPS, touchscreens, and the advances in voice recognition underlying Siri.
Similarly, in many countries, it is the public sector that is leading the way in making green technology possible.
Recognizing the importance of government investment in promoting innovation and growth implies the need to rethink the conventional wisdom about state intervention.
Instead of focusing on picking individual technologies or firms, public organizations should act like investors, betting on a diversified “portfolio” of choices.
Like any other investor, the state will not always succeed.
In fact, failure is more likely, because government agencies often invest in the areas of highest uncertainty, where private capital is reluctant to enter.
This means that public organizations must be capable of taking chances and learning from trial and error.
If failure is an unavoidable part of the innovation game, and if government is crucial for innovation, society must be more tolerant of “government failure.”
But the reality is that when government fails, there is public outcry – and silence when it succeeds.
For example, the bankruptcy of the US solar energy firm Solyndra, which received a $500 million government-guaranteed loan, triggered partisan protests.
Yet few have paused to consider that the government provided nearly the same amount to Tesla to help it develop the Tesla S car, a product that is considered an archetype of Silicon Valley innovation.
What, then, might make the public more accepting of government failure?
Private venture capitalists cover their losses from failed investments with their profits from those that succeed; but government programs are rarely set up to generate significant returns.
While some argue that the government’s return comes through taxes, the current tax system is not working, owing not only to loopholes, but also to rate reductions.
When NASA was founded, the top marginal tax rate was over 90%.
And capital gains tax has fallen by more than 50% since the 1980s.
In order to build support for public investment in higher-risk innovation, perhaps taxpayers should receive a more direct return, by channeling profits into a public innovation fund to finance the next wave of technologies.
When investments are in upstream basic research, the spillover effect across industries and sectors is sometimes enough of a social reward.
But other cases might require creating alternative incentives.
For example, some of the profits from the government’s investment in Tesla could have been recovered through shares (or royalties), and used to cover the losses from its investment in Solyndra.
Repayment of public loans to business could be made contingent on income, as student loans often are.
And the prices of drugs that are developed largely with NIH funding could be capped, so that the taxpayer does not pay twice.
One thing is clear: the current approach suffers from serious shortcomings, largely because it socializes the risks and privatizes the rewards.
This is hurting not only future innovation opportunities, but also the government’s ability to communicate its role to the public.
Acknowledging the role that the state has played – and should continue to play – in shaping innovation enables us to begin debating the most important question: What are the new visionary public investments needed to drive future economic growth?
The Productivity of Trust
CAMBRIDGE – The Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman once quipped that “Canada is essentially closer to the United States than it is to itself.”
After all, most of its citizens live in a narrow band along the more than 3,000-mile-long border.
Most Canadians live closer to more Americans than they do to other Canadians.
The same can be said of corporations and governments.
Most firms are closer to the government than they are to other firms: they interact with government rules and agencies more than they do with the rest of the business community.
The quality of that interaction and its evolution over time is probably the most fundamental determinant of a country’s potential for growth and prosperity.
But this is not the Weltanschauung – the worldview – that permeates private-sector discourse, especially the views expressed by most chambers of trade and industry and business associations around the world.
Business organizations often hew to Ronald Reagan’s dictum: “Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.”
It is a great sound bite: short, recursive, and somewhat poetic.
Unfortunately, it is also dangerously misleading.
After all, even if government were the problem, then changing what it does must be part of the solution.
The truth is that markets cannot exist without governments, and vice versa.
Governments are essential to the establishment of security, justice, property rights, and contract enforcement, all of which are essential to a market economy.
Governments must also organize the provision of infrastructure for transportation, communication, energy, water, and waste disposal.
They run and regulate health-care systems and primary, secondary, tertiary, and vocational education.
They create the rules and provide the certifications that allow firms to assure their customers, workers, and neighbors that what they do is safe.
They protect creditors and minority shareholders from miscreant managers (and managers from impulsive creditors).
Saying that governments should get out of the way and let the private sector do its thing is like saying that air traffic controllers should get out of the way and let pilots do their thing.
In fact, governments and the private sector need each other, and they need to find better ways to collaborate.
The problem is that in many countries, both developed and developing, the current relationship between the private sector and the government is often dysfunctional.
Not only is it characterized by deep distrust, but the broader society does not find a closer relationship to be either legitimate or in the public interest, and for good reason.
The private sector often engages with the government in order to make itself more profitable.
After all, maximizing profits is what CEOs are supposed to do.
And the government has ways to help: It can force suppliers to sell their inputs more cheaply, repress workers’ wage demands, protect the final market from competition by imports or new entrants, or lower their taxes.
But these schemes make firms more profitable by making their suppliers, workers, and customers poorer.
Accepting such demands makes the government rightly illegitimate in the eyes of the rest of society, which cherishes higher priorities than redistribution in favor of the already rich.
Outcomes would be very different if the focus of the relationship were productivity rather than profitability.
Productivity improvements, by lowering costs, allow firms to pay their workers and suppliers better, reduce prices for consumers, pay more in taxes, and still make more money for their shareholders.
A focus on productivity is win-win-win.
Governments can do many things, in a variety of areas, to raise productivity.
Fresh produce requires a cold-storage logistic system, a green lane at customs, certification of good agricultural practices, and sanitary permits.
Tourism depends on sensible visa requirements, convenient airports, road signs, hotel construction permits, and the preservation of cultural sites and coastlines.
Manufacturing requires dedicated urban space that is adequately connected to power, water, transport, logistics, security, and a diverse labor force.
All of these productivity-boosting inputs require institutions that teach and extend industry-relevant knowledge and skills.
None of them appears in the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators or the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index.
And yet, without these public inputs, the industries that depend on them cannot succeed.
That is precisely what happens in the absence of a sound and legitimate basis for cooperation between the government and the private sector.
The result is inadequate provision of public goods that raise productivity and make everyone better off.
To create such a basis for cooperation, many countries need a new compact between the government and the private sector.
This will not be possible if business groups insist on putting taxes at the center of the discussion.
Instead, they should focus on measures that raise productivity.
More broadly, business groups should seek only those government policies that are unambiguously in the public interest.
Demands that are perceived as greedy erode legitimacy and, ultimately, effectiveness.
In this context, watchdog NGOs dedicated to scoring the public-interest value of what business groups ask for from the government could facilitate trust.
Perhaps most important, business associations do their members a disservice by seeking to impose on them a single voice.
Doing so usually leads to a focus on policies that are preferred by all members – such as lower taxes – instead of measures that are important to the productivity of each member.
Just as monopolies are bad for markets and politics, business representation in the private sector would benefit from more competition.
The Procurement Goldmine
WASHINGTON, DC – Gold is rare.
More than 99.9% of the Earth’s crust is composed of oxides of silicon, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, potassium, titanium, and phosphorus.
So, for most of human history, people have become quite excited when they have discovered gold.
Despite the serious environmental consequences of gold mining, including mercury and cyanide pollution and the devastation of landscapes, humanity has not given up the search – and seems unlikely to do so any time soon.
But there is a figurative goldmine – safer and potentially at least as lucrative as the real thing – that most countries possess, but few choose to exploit fully: government procurement.
The potential adverse consequences of government procurement are well known.
It can enable companies to charge excessive prices for low-quality goods and unreliable services, while facilitating corruption, abuses of power, and waste.
To mitigate these risks, most countries have implemented requirements for open bidding processes and strict transparency rules for government purchases.
Indeed, most recent free-trade agreements require signatories to open up government procurement to one another’s firms, and the World Bank publishes the names of firms barred for fraud or corruption from bidding on Bank-financed projects.
Countries that forego open bidding processes end up with the kind of large-scale theft that has been documented in Venezuela and almost certainly occurred in Ukraine under deposed President Viktor Yanukovych.
But beneath all of this arsenic is gold.
Most modern production involves not just the cost of doing things, but also the cost of figuring out how to do them.
Before aircraft manufacturers can produce and sell a new airplane model, they must spend billions of dollars over a decade or more of development – costs that must later be recouped.
If they were not sure whether there would be a market for the new model, few would assume these costs.
That is where government procurement comes in.
For example, in 1946, the United States government issued a contract for Boeing to develop the B-52.
The government obviously did not want the company to deliver more of the same; it wanted the first fast jet-powered strategic bomber.
After all, the second-best army in a war is the loser.
The contract thus had to reflect the risks inherent in finding out how to design and produce the most advanced aircraft of its time.
But the benefits of the government purchase extended beyond its specific goal, when Boeing used the knowhow it acquired developing the B-52 to create its commercial B-707 aircraft.
Though the government never purposely promoted the development of commercial airplanes, its procurement of high-quality, technologically advanced military aircraft was essential to the emergence of America’s globally dominant commercial aircraft industry.
Simply put, figuring out how to do one thing often makes it easier to do other things.
In this way, a government that is exacting about the quality of its purchases can have a powerful impact on the evolution of its country’s comparative advantage.
Israel’s government has had a similar impact through its effort to manage its limited water resources.
Let’s say that the country incurs a cost of 100 of some unit because of its water shortages.
The innovations that the government encourages, such as drip irrigation or desalination, not only reduce the domestic cost of such shortages to, say, 70, but also underpin an industry that, by selling its wares in the most demanding markets, accrues a global value of more than 1,000.
In this sense, Israel’s water scarcity has made the country wealthier than it otherwise would have been.
Likewise, Israel’s military investments have generated a set of solutions that, with some extra effort, have had useful – and lucrative – civilian applications.
This helps to explain why private investment in research and development constitutes a larger share of GDP in Israel than anywhere else in the world.
The lessons from army purchases can be applied elsewhere.
Governments are in the business of procuring solutions to their particular society’s most pressing challenges.
Given that a country’s problems are rarely unique, innovative solutions can spawn globally competitive – even dominant – industries.
And solutions for one problem may have applications in other areas.
This should serve as a model for Latin America as it works to improve the quality of its educational systems.
As it stands, the eight Latin American countries that take the OECD’s standardized PISA exam are among the 15 worst-performing countries of the 65 that participate in the program.
Instead of sinking massive amounts of money into poorly performing school systems, Latin American governments would undoubtedly be interested in innovative solutions, such as tablet-based textbooks, that can help teachers provide effective lessons, monitor their students’ progress, and identify remediation strategies.
Beyond improving their own children’s performance, such efforts could spawn a globally competitive industry in state-of-the-art teaching tools.
These are just a few examples of the value that can be extracted from the government-procurement goldmine.
By committing to purchase large amounts of high-quality products that address major national challenges, governments can encourage private, public, or mixed organizations to incur the fixed costs of finding solutions.
In many cases, the benefits of those solutions will extend far beyond their original purpose.
But, in pursuing such a path, governments must remember that mining is a potentially dangerous industry that must be approached with care.
To this end, they could begin by applying, say, 5% of their procurement budgets to nurture urgently needed solutions in areas with potentially large global markets.
After all, anything that is worth doing is worth doing better.
Let’s Get Fiscal
LONDON – Everyone knows there is no gain without pain.
But there can be pain without gain – a lesson that Western populations have been learning the hard way since at least 2012.
With years of fiscal austerity in the United States, Europe, and Japan having achieved nothing, it is time for governments to start spending again.
The proposal will be met with outrage from many governments, especially, but not exclusively, Germany’s, and will be dismissed by the many political candidates who treat sovereign debt, built up by the incumbents they are seeking to depose, as the devil’s work.
But beyond ideology and self-interest lies a simple and unavoidable truth: austerity is not working.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reluctantly acknowledged austerity’s failure when he announced on June 1 that his government would postpone a planned increase in the country’s consumption tax.
Far from helping to control Japan’s budget deficit and huge public debt, the tax hike probably would have reduced revenues.
After all, the previous hike, implemented in April 2014, quickly drove the economy back into recession.
The eurozone – the developed world’s leading champion of austerity – has yet to come to the same realization, despite glaring evidence.
In 2012, eurozone leaders signed a fiscal compact aimed at controlling public debt – which, in total, amounted to 91.3% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund – by forcing countries to cut spending and raise taxes.
By 2015, the eurozone’s budget deficit, as a share of GDP, had fallen by two-thirds from its peak in 2010.
Yet gross public debt had actually increased, to 93.2% of GDP.
Indeed, while Germany has managed to reduce its gross public debt, from 79.7% of GDP in 2012 to 71% last year, debt ratios in France and Italy have continued to rise, despite tight fiscal controls (especially in Italy).
Elsewhere in Europe, the United Kingdom has followed a similar trajectory, with gross public debt increasing from 85.3% of GDP in 2012 to 89.3% of GDP in 2015.
And in the US, the debt ratio rose from 102.5% to 105.8% over the same period.
The problem, of course, lies in sluggish economic growth, which undermines wage growth, weakens tax revenues, and makes it impossible for governments to pay down their debts.
Among the biggest drags on growth today is fiscal austerity.
The more governments cut their deficits, the faster growth slows – and the further out of reach debt-reduction targets become.
Thus runs the self-defeating cycle of fiscal austerity.
To be sure, this is not always how austerity works.
In the inflation-plagued 1970s and 1980s, when investors’ demand for inflation-risk premia pushed up long-term borrowing costs, larger deficits tended to boost long-term interest rates further, while smaller deficits reduced them.
It was this experience that caused policymakers after 2010 to assume that reducing government demand would help to boost private investment.
(In the eurozone, it should be noted, arguments for fiscal austerity were also fueled by mistrust among governments, with creditor countries demanding that debtors endure some pain in exchange for “gains” like bailouts.)
But times have changed.
For starters, we are no longer living in an inflationary era.
On the contrary, Japan and some eurozone countries face deflation, while inflation in the UK is essentially zero.
Only in America is inflation picking up – and only gently.
Moreover, long-term borrowing costs are at historic lows, just as they have been throughout the last five years.
Pursuing austerity in this context has resulted in a drag on growth so severe that not even the halving of energy prices over the last 18 months has overcome it.
Expansionary monetary policy – that is, massive injections of liquidity through so-called quantitative easing – is clearly not enough, either.
While QE does serve a purpose – and remains necessary in Europe and Japan – it has failed to stimulate private investment and accelerate job creation and wage growth.
Some direct intervention in wages may help.
The UK has implemented an increase in the mandatory minimum wage, and some US states, led by California, will soon follow.
Japan, which faces stagnant wages, despite apparent labor shortages, may stand to benefit the most from this approach.
But, in today’s world, nothing can substitute for fiscal expansion.
Many countries, particularly in Europe, need to boost public investment in infrastructure.
More broadly, Europe needs a new Marshall Plan, this time self-financed, rather than funded by the Americans, to kick-start economic growth and boost productivity.
There is plenty of scope for a similar program in the US, too.
Such spending could even help get tax revenues growing, by pushing employment and wages higher.
At a time of low borrowing costs and little to no inflation (or even deflation), austerity is not the answer.
It is time for policymakers to recognize that there is no need for pain that is not bringing any gain.
It is time to get fiscal.
Grading Obamanomics
PALO ALTO – It is still too soon to gauge the full economic impact of President Barack Obama’s implemented and proposed policies, but a preliminary read indicates limited short-term benefit at large long-term cost.
The administration is exploiting a crisis atmosphere to enact a vast agenda that would reengineer the American economy, from autos and financial services to health care, energy, and the distribution of income.
Obama outsourced the details of the $787 billion fiscal stimulus to Congress and, no surprise, the old barons of the House stuffed it with pork and social engineering.
Several months later, only 4%-6% of the funds have been spent, and the federal government is brow-beating state governments – for example, demanding that California rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $7 billion in stimulus funds.
(Intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration).
The foreclosure relief plan is off to an even slower start, and is likely to run into numerous problems concerning how to rework delinquent mortgages without inducing a lot more delinquencies.
So score the stimulus a very expensive, largely wasted opportunity.
Instead, Obama could, for example, have suspended the payroll tax for a year, getting money directly into people’s pockets quickly and decreasing the need for firms to lay off workers.
Obama’s long-run budget calls for much higher spending, higher taxes, and an explosion of debt that will crowd out borrowing in capital markets by private companies, state and local governments, and developing countries.
Obama would add $6.5 trillion to the United States’ national debt, more than all previous presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush, combined.
That is in addition to explicit tax hikes on income, capital gains, and dividends, the implicit ones on energy via cap-and-trade, etc.
It appears that the Obama strategy is to “stuff the beast” (the mirror image of the tax-cutting “starve the beast” philosophy attributed to some of President Ronald Reagan’s advisers), i.e., to initiate massive spending and hide the true cost from citizens.
The large deficits will eventually force much higher taxes, such as a national value-added tax similar to those in Europe, or gigantic increases in everyone’s income taxes.
The Federal Reserve lowered its target federal funds rate to zero before Obama was inaugurated, and initiated many programs to try to revive credit markets, with mixed results (the commercial paper facility has helped, whereas others seem to have gotten off to less sanguine starts).
The Fed’s independence is a key component of its anti-inflation credibility, and a key test for Obama will be to support the Fed’s efforts to withdraw the liquidity before substantial inflation pressures assert themselves several years from now. 
The Obama administration also seems to be heading toward regulating derivatives and financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
America does need a clearinghouse for derivatives, and a much higher percentage of derivative trading should take place on exchanges, rather than bilaterally over the counter.
Any institution that is or could quickly become too big to fail needs to have adequate capital (rising with size), and real-time continuous monitoring of risk, but these measures should be implemented without overbearing micromanagement.
Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s decision to put the unions ahead of secured debt-holders in the orchestrated Chrysler bankruptcy risks rupturing the basic fabric of credit markets.
But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s much-ridiculed bank “stress tests” made sense (although one can argue that sufficiently dire scenarios were not included or that too much was negotiated with the banks, etc.).
Determining the size of likely losses is necessary to decide whether banks’ retained earnings from profitable ongoing operations and their ability to raise private capital will allow them to work down their toxic assets over time.
If not, more draconian solutions will be necessary. 
I support Geithner’s plan to cooperate with private investors in dealing with the banks’ toxic assets, because they make better business decisions than government bureaucrats.
But the Fed’s low-interest, non-recourse loans to buy up toxic assets have not yet caused a stampede of participants.
Will banks be willing to part with the assets at a low enough price to attract private investment?
And would doing so force larger write-downs, requiring banks, in turn, to ration credit – and thus harming the economy?
Obama has been better than feared on international trade.
He was famously protectionist during the primaries, declaring he would unilaterally rewrite NAFTA.
But, while he has continued his softer tone since the election, he has not even bothered to ask for fast-track trade-promotion authority, let alone try to pump new life into the Doha Round of global trade talks.
Obama is getting a large part of his agenda.
Unfortunately, the numbers don’t add up and he is laying twin time bombs with the explosion of federal government debt and inefficient government micromanagement of the economy.
His call for immense deficits  even once the economy is back to normal, funds are returned from the financial bailouts, and the US is out of Iraq – is simply irresponsible.
The American economy will likely return to growth late this year and next, especially with all the monetary and fiscal stimulus (growth would have initially been slower and then much stronger without it), but it will still be an economy on a government lifeline.
The big questions left unanswered are how far Obama wants to push the US toward a European-style social-welfare state, how he intends to pay for it, and how much long-term economic damage will result?
Grandmasters and Global Growth
CAMBRIDGE – As the global economy limps out of the last decade and enters a new one in 2010, what will be the next big driver of global growth? Here’s betting that the “teens” is a decade in which artificial intelligence hits escape velocity, and starts to have an economic impact on par with the emergence of India and China.
Admittedly, my perspective is heavily colored by events in the world of chess, a game I once played at a professional level and still follow from a distance.
Though special, computer chess nevertheless offers both a window into silicon evolution and a barometer of how people might adapt to it.
In 1996 and 1997, World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov played a pair of matches against an IBM computer named “Deep Blue.” At the time, Kasparov dominated world chess, in the same way that Tiger Woods – at least until recently – has dominated golf.
In the 1996 match, Deep Blue stunned the champion by beating him in the first game. But Kasparov quickly adjusted to exploit the computer’s weakness in long-term strategic planning, where his judgment and intuition seemed to trump the computer’s mechanical counting.
Unfortunately, the supremely confident Kasparov did not take Deep Blue seriously enough in the 1997 rematch.
Deep Blue shocked the champion, winning the match 3.5 to 2.5.
Many commentators have labeled Deep Blue’s triumph one of the most important events of the twentieth century.
Perhaps Kasparov would have won the rematch had it continued to a full 24 games (then the standard length of world championship matches).
But, over the next few years, even as humans learned from computers, computers improved at a far faster pace.
With ever more powerful processors, silicon chess players developed the ability to calculate so far ahead that the distinction between short-term tactical calculations and long-term strategic planning became blurred.
At the same time, computer programs began to exploit huge databases of games between grandmaster (the highest title in chess), using results from the human games to extrapolate what moves have the highest chances of success. Soon, it became clear that even the best human chess players would have little chance to do better than an occasional draw.
Today, chess programs have become so good that even grandmasters sometimes struggle to understand the logic behind some of their moves.
In chess magazines, one often sees comments from top players such as “My silicon friend says I should have moved my King instead of my Queen, but I still think I played the best ‘human’ move.”
It gets worse. Many commercially available computer programs can be set to mimic the styles of top grandmasters to an extent that is almost uncanny.
Indeed, chess programs now come very close to passing the late British mathematician Alan Turing’s ultimate test of artificial intelligence: can a human conversing with the machine tell it is not human?
I sure can’t.
Ironically, as computer-aided cheating increasingly pervades chess tournaments (with accusations reaching the highest levels), the main detection device requires using another computer.
Only a machine can consistently tell what another computer would do in a given position. Perhaps if Turing were alive today, he would define artificial intelligence as the inability of a computer to tell whether another machine is human!
Encouragingly, the answer is “not yet.” In fact, in some ways, chess is as popular and successful today as at any point in the last few decades.   Chess lends itself very well to Internet play, and fans can follow top-level tournaments in real time, often with commentary.
Technology has helped thoroughly globalize chess, with the Indian Vishy Anand now the first Asian world champion, and the handsome young Norwegian Magnus Carlsen having reached rock-star status. Man and machine have learned to co-exist, for now.
Of course, this is a microcosm of the larger changes that we can expect.
The horrible computerized telephone-answering systems that we all now suffer with might actually improve.
Imagine, someday you might actually prefer digital to human operators.
In 50 years, computers might be doing everything from driving taxis to performing routine surgery.
Sooner than that, artificial intelligence will transform higher learning, potentially making a world-class university education broadly affordable even in poor developing countries.
And, of course, there are more mundane but crucial uses of artificial intelligence everywhere, from managing the electronics and lighting in our homes to populating “smart grids” for water and electricity, helping monitor these and other systems to reduce waste.
In short, I do not share the view of many that, after the Internet and the personal computer, it will be a long wait until the next paradigm-shifting innovation.
Artificial intelligence will provide the boost that keeps the teens rolling.
So, despite a rough start from the financial crisis (which will still slow global growth this year and next), there is no reason why the new decade has to be an economic flop.
Barring another round of deep financial crises, it won’t be – as long as politicians do not stand in the way of the new paradigm of trade, technology, and artificial intelligence.
The Grassroots of Climate Change
PARIS – The climate-change agreement reached here on December 12 was a rich victory for diplomacy.
Both the agreement itself and the atmosphere of cooperation that permeated the proceedings represent a sea change from the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009.
But while we should congratulate world leaders on their success, Paris marks the beginning, not the end, of the road.
It is now our collective duty to hold our leaders to account and ensure that they turn promises into action – especially in the world’s most vulnerable regions, such as Africa.
We should applaud China, India, the United States, and the European Union for their pre-Paris pledges on climate action.
These countries’ commitments created the sense of responsibility, trust, and solidarity that enabled 195 nations not merely to agree on a one-off deal, but to set in motion a series of increasingly ambitious five-year cycles to phase out greenhouse-gas emissions this century.
This is a clear signal that the carbon era has reached a turning point; as a result, there will be more investment in renewable energy.
Countries also promised to work harder to protect the world’s most vulnerable, by aiming to limit average global warming to as little as 1.5º Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
And developed countries pledged at least $100 billion of annual climate finance to help the least developed countries cut their carbon emissions and prepare for climate change.
For the first time, an international agreement offers the least developed countries funds to cover some of the loss and damage caused by climate shocks.
But in order to fulfill the Paris agreement, we must ensure that governments keep their promises.
National emissions targets are voluntary, rather than inscribed in the agreement, so they are not legally binding.
In hard, practical terms, there is not yet anything specific to slow the extraction of fossil fuels or stop high-polluting countries from using coal for electricity.
Developed countries made no individual commitments, and the starting year for funding adaptation assistance remains unclear.
We must keep the pressure on to make sure that the promised climate finance is sufficient to enable the least-developed countries to adapt to present and future climate change.
All of this must happen urgently.
The cumulative effect of previous decades of emissions means that there will be no chance for a last-minute solution.
In Africa, climate change may already be responsible for falling water levels in West African rivers; declining coral reefs in tropical waters; lower fruit production in the Sahel; fewer fish in the Great Lakes region; and the spread of malaria in the Kenyan uplands.
Without significant cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, we will see far worse.
By threatening basic human needs, such as food and water, climate change will be a catalyst for instability, migration, and conflict.
Africa will pay a heavy price.
Fortunately, we now know that we can prevent catastrophic climate change while still providing the energy needed to sustain economic growth, create jobs, and lift millions of people out of poverty.
The many benefits of pursuing a low-carbon development path include not only cleaner air and better energy security, but also the opportunities that arise from decentralized and renewable power.
These opportunities are particularly crucial for Africa, where more than 620 million people live without electricity.
The falling cost of solar power, batteries, and LED lighting means that renewable sources can now provide affordable, modern energy.
In Kenya, for example, Maasai women in Magadi who have been trained to install solar power have brought electricity to 2,000 households in just two years.
But to realize this economic and social potential, African leaders must combat corruption.
They must make the management of their utilities more transparent, strengthen regulations, and increase public spending on energy infrastructure.
Investment and external financing must follow.
This is not a question of aid, but of fairness, given that Africa contributes so little to global emissions but stands to suffer the most from climate change.
Investing in low-carbon energy also makes sound business sense: It boosts technology companies and promotes social entrepreneurship globally.
I am pleased that two initiatives launched in Paris will take us farther down the renewable-energy path.
Europe and Canada pledged $10 billion toward an ambitious project called the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to install ten gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal capacity by the end of the decade.
And France and India launched the International Solar Alliance to raise more than $1 trillion by 2030 to deploy solar power in more than 100 developing countries.
The Paris agreement has drawn the first broad strokes of a solution to climate change.
But until its targets are translated into action, the world’s least-developed countries may not be convinced that the developed countries are serious about equity – or “climate justice.”
For Africa, 2015 must be a turning point.
If the world’s citizens hold their leaders to account for the targets they have set, it will be.
Quite simply, the historic responsibility for the planet’s future rests on the shoulders of us all.
Revanchist China
SYDNEY – In a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, on February 22, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe informed the audience of officials, experts, and journalists that Japan is “back” and will not stand down in its ongoing sovereignty dispute with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands.
With Chinese provocations on the rise, US President Barack Obama, Abe’s host, appealed for calm and restraint on both sides.
Japan is likely to accede – grudgingly – to America’s request, as it remains dependent on its alliance with the US for its security.
But it will be much more difficult to persuade China that it should stand down.
China’s assertiveness over its sovereignty claim reflects more than a desire to exploit seabed resources, or to gain a widened strategic gateway into the western Pacific.
It is also about national renewal and rejuvenation – the core of the Chinese Communist Party’s raison d’être.
Turning away from a fight with its former occupier and historical rival would be a step backward in this six-decade-long quest.
The idea of Chinese renewal or rejuvenation was popularized by then-Premier Zhao Ziyang in the late 1980’s, and frequently promoted by Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.
Most recently, incoming President Xi Jinping, visiting the National Museum of China’s “Road Toward Renewal” exhibition, pledged to continue the “great renewal of the Chinese nation.”
What does “renewal” or “rejuvenation” mean to the Chinese?
All nations – great and small – embody a combination of historical fact and myth.
In this case, the CCP’s view of rejuvenation is built on the belief that the zenith of Chinese power under the Ming and Qing dynasties represents the natural, just, and permanent state of affairs for a 5,000-year-old civilization.
When Mao Zedong took power in 1949, his immediate goal was to re-establish the “greater China” of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), insisting that the Manchu-led empire was the permanent and enduring China.
But, while the assault on the Qing Dynasty by foreign powers is a historical fact, the notion that there has been one enduring China struggling against avaricious outsiders across several millennia is false and self-serving.
Mao achieved his goal following the so-called peaceful liberation of the East Turkestan Republic (now Xinjiang) in 1949 and the invasion of Tibet in 1950, which promptly increased China’s size by more than one-third.
And every CCP leader since has carried forward his vision of a greater China, adjusting and expanding it as the country’s power grows.
For example, China showed little interest in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands prior to 1968 – the year a geographical study pointed to vast oil reserves beneath the seabed.
The same can be said for China’s growing stridency with respect to its claims in the South China Sea.
In 2009, relying heavily on a dubious historical claim, China formally tabled its “nine-dotted line” map to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, and has since referred to almost all of the South China Sea as being under its “indisputable sovereignty.”
Having dominated East and Southeast Asia for all but the last two centuries of the past two millennia, China is chafing at the current US-led regional order of sovereign states, in which even the smallest enjoys the same rights, privileges, and protection as the largest.
Modern China has benefited enormously from this arrangement; nonetheless, there is keen resentment that the Chinese civilization-state’s vast achievements over several thousand years offer China no special status.
To a people imbued with a deep sense of superior moral worth, historical achievement, and victimization by foreign powers, this state of affairs is unjust and unnatural.
It follows that pulling back from any territorial dispute with smaller and inferior states would be seen as a humiliating defeat, rather than a step toward ensuring long-term regional stability.
Moreover, an expanding view of greater China implies that a resolution of the dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in China’s favor would be likely to embolden rather than satisfy its ambitions.
Making good on its claim to the South China Sea could be next.
As Obama and Abe forge a common strategy aimed at helping to manage China’s rise peacefully, they must understand that China’s conception of renewal seeks to resurrect a glorious past, and that this implies revision, not affirmation, of the existing regional order.
This means that they will have to limit China’s strategic and military options, even if they cannot constrain its ambitions.
Greece and the Limits of Anti-Austerity
CAMBRIDGE – Is austerity dead?
At last month’s G-8 meeting at Camp David, the German-led austerity program for the eurozone’s troubled southern members ran up against substantial resistance.
Likewise, France’s recent presidential election bolstered those who argue that Europe must grow its way out of its debt-heavy public sector, rather than aim for immediate fiscal orthodoxy.
And there is no guarantee that Greece’s newly elected center-right New Democracy party, which favors honoring the country’s bailout terms, will be able to form a majority government.
The United States, by contrast, has pursued expansionary and growth-oriented macroeconomic policies since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, despite massive budget deficits.
Thus far, judging from the modest recovery in the US versus non-recovery in Europe, American policy accommodation is performing better than European austerity.
But simply choosing between expansion and austerity is not the whole story.
Macroeconomic policies interact with on-the-ground microeconomic realities in subtle but powerful, rarely remarked-upon ways.
Simply put, Europe’s microeconomic structure makes the same growth-based macroeconomic policies less effective in the European Union than in the US.
Here’s why: macroeconomic easing, by lowering interest rates or otherwise pumping money into the economy, aims to increase economic activity.
With more money moving around, businesses rehire employees and ask existing employees to work more hours.
Entrepreneurs considering whether or not to start a business decide to proceed, and their bank lends them the money to make the new business viable.
The newly hired workers and newly formed businesses spend money, which induces more hiring, more start-ups, and yet more spending.
The economy grows, yielding higher tax revenues, thereby helping governments to put their fiscal house in order.
The country grows its way out of its economic problems.
But the EU cannot realize this scenario as easily as the US can, because micro-level rules in the EU generate friction that slows that kind of an expansion.
The EU’s stricter labor rules are a well-known and often-cited example.
European labor-market rigidities mean that it is difficult in many EU countries to downsize a company.
Anticipating that difficulty, companies are less willing to hire in the first place, until they are sure that long-term demand for their products is sufficient to justify long-term hires.
Hence, even if businesses get easier access to money and loans, many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale, fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn.
For example, The Economist’s recent portrait of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti shows that Italy continues to be stymied by labor rules that make businesses reluctant to expand beyond 15 employees (after which it becomes hard for a firm to downsize).
To work smoothly, expansive macroeconomic policies require compatible microeconomic rules.
There is some irony in the fact that the strongest proponent of austerity has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, because Germany, particularly under her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder’s Social Democrat-led government, did much more to liberalize the country’s rules for labor and business than other EU governments.
Expansive, growth-based policy could work better in Germany than in many eurozone countries for which it is being prescribed.
Rules that impede business start-ups may be an even more important obstacle to making monetary expansion effective.
It is simply too difficult to launch many types of businesses in many places, and to expand those that are started.
Necessary licenses are often not routinely obtained. The simple start-up paperwork is still more burdensome than it is in the US.
Indeed, while this process has become easier in Europe in recent years, the World Bank estimates that it still takes twice as long to start up a small business in Greece and much of the rest of the EU as it does in the US – and four times as long in Spain.
While the relative absence of Facebook-style mega-entrepreneurial successes in Europe is regularly bemoaned, the difficulties of opening hairdressers, basic retailers, and simple mail-order businesses may have an equally profound overall effect.
Consider taxi licensing.
Many people can drive a cab, including many who are unemployed, but not so many can get permission to do so in many major cities in Europe and the US.
Imagine much of the economy organized like the taxi industry.
Most kinds of economic stimulus won’t generate more taxis, until entry restrictions are reduced.
Magda Bianco, Silvia Giacomelli, and Giacomo Rodano, researchers at the Bank of Italy, report that these institutional roadblocks to expansion remain substantial in Italy.
A factory might get easier access to funds, and it might see more demand for its products, but, rather than hiring new workers, it might decide to raise its prices.
A potential competitor might consider entering that market; but, given substantial regulatory entry barriers, it might ultimately decide to remain in its current business.
Expansionary monetary policy in such an environment might fail.
Perhaps for this reason, France’s new president, François Hollande, favors using the government to direct specific outcomes – for example, by hiring 60,000 new teachers.
One can imagine a grand bargain in Europe, with expansionary macroeconomic policies coupled with the easing of microeconomic impediments.
But existing businesses and already-employed workers prefer the status quo, and can powerfully inhibit policymakers.
There may be more than a little of this in Greek politics, and that of other EU countries.
Europe’s Last Act?
NEW YORK – European Union leaders continue to play a game of brinkmanship with the Greek government.
Greece has met its creditors’ demands far more than halfway.
Yet Germany and Greece’s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a program that has proven to be a failure, and that few economists ever thought could, would, or should be implemented.
The swing in Greece’s fiscal position from a large primary deficit to a surplus was almost unprecedented, but the demand that the country achieve a primary surplus of 4.5% of GDP was unconscionable.
Unfortunately, at the time that the “troika” – the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund – first included this irresponsible demand in the international financial program for Greece, the country’s authorities had no choice but to accede to it.
The folly of continuing to pursue this program is particularly acute now, given the 25% decline in GDP that Greece has endured since the beginning of the crisis.
The troika badly misjudged the macroeconomic effects of the program that they imposed.
According to their published forecasts, they believed that, by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures, Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth.
They also believed that the first debt restructuring would lead to debt sustainability.
The troika’s forecasts have been wrong, and repeatedly so.
And not by a little, but by an enormous amount.
Greece’s voters were right to demand a change in course, and their government is right to refuse to sign on to a deeply flawed program.
Having said that, there is room for a deal: Greece has made clear its willingness to engage in continued reforms, and has welcomed Europe’s help in implementing some of them.
A dose of reality on the part of Greece’s creditors – about what is achievable, and about the macroeconomic consequences of different fiscal and structural reforms – could provide the basis of an agreement that would be good not only for Greece, but for all of Europe.
Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone.
The market has, they claim, already “priced in” such a rupture.
Some even suggest that it would be good for the monetary union.
I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.
A similar degree of complacency was evident in the United States before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The fragility of America’s banks had been known for a long time – at least since the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns the previous March.
Yet, given the lack of transparency (owing in part to weak regulation), both markets and policymakers did not fully appreciate the linkages among financial institutions.
Indeed, the world’s financial system is still feeling the aftershocks of the Lehman collapse.
And banks remain non-transparent, and thus at risk.
We still don’t know the full extent of linkages among financial institutions, including those arising from non-transparent derivatives and credit default swaps.
In Europe, we can already see some of the consequences of inadequate regulation and the flawed design of the eurozone itself.
We know that the structure of the eurozone encourages divergence, not convergence: as capital and talented people leave crisis-hit economies, these countries become less able to repay their debts.
As markets grasp that a vicious downward spiral is structurally embedded in the euro, the consequences for the next crisis become profound.
And another crisis in inevitable: it is in the very nature of capitalism.
ECB President Mario Draghi’s confidence trick, in the form of his declaration in 2012 that the monetary authorities would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro, has worked so far.
But the knowledge that the euro is not a binding commitment among its members will make it far less likely to work the next time.
Bond yields could spike, and no amount of reassurance by the ECB and Europe’s leaders would suffice to bring them down from stratospheric levels, because the world now knows that they will not do “whatever it takes.”
As the example of Greece has shown, they will do only what short-sighted electoral politics demands.
The most important consequence, I fear, is the weakening of European solidarity.
The euro was supposed to strengthen it.
Instead, it has had the opposite effect.
It is not in the interest of Europe – or the world – to have a country on Europe’s periphery alienated from its neighbors, especially now, when geopolitical instability is already so evident.
The neighboring Middle East is in turmoil; the West is attempting to contain a newly aggressive Russia; and China, already the world’s largest source of savings, the largest trading country, and the largest overall economy (in terms of purchasing power parity), is confronting the West with new economic and strategic realities.
This is no time for European disunion.
Europe’s leaders viewed themselves as visionaries when they created the euro.
They thought they were looking beyond the short-term demands that usually preoccupy political leaders.
Unfortunately, their understanding of economics fell short of their ambition; and the politics of the moment did not permit the creation of the institutional framework that might have enabled the euro to work as intended.
Although the single currency was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity, it is difficult to detect a significant positive effect for the eurozone as a whole in the period before the crisis.
In the period since, the adverse effects have been enormous.
The future of Europe and the euro now depends on whether the eurozone’s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of, and concern for, European solidarity.
We are likely to begin finding out the answer to that existential question in the next few weeks.
Europe’s Greek Failure
BRUSSELS – Narratives matter, especially when they are intertwined with hard interests.
As Greece and its creditors court catastrophe, we are getting a clear picture of how conflicting narratives can lead to a lose-lose result.
The facts are indisputable.
In early 2010, when the Greek government could no longer finance itself, it turned to its European partners and the International Monetary Fund for financial support.
And they delivered: not only did other eurozone countries issue loans to Greece, but the IMF provided its largest-ever loan to the country.
Later, Greece received even more support through the eurozone’s bailout funds.
The result was hundreds of billions of euros worth of assistance.
But, as time progressed, Greece and its creditors came to view these facts very differently.
As Greece’s economic situation deteriorated, its citizens got the sense that the loans were not really intended to help them, but rather to bail out German and French banks.
With this narrative, Greeks could avoid admitting the role of their own government’s policy mistakes in thrusting them into recession.
Greece’s creditors, by contrast, felt that they had generously saved a profligate country from bankruptcy.
This narrative allowed policymakers in Germany to disregard the fact that their country’s banks had financed Greek borrowing for too long.
Both narratives contain a large amount of truth, but conveniently overlook some important facts.
For instance, a substantial share of the loans given to Greece until early 2012 was indeed used to pay off maturing debt.
But it is likely that the holders of the debt were no longer French or German banks – who for the most part would have been unable to bear the uncertainty that preceded the 2012 bailout and haircut on Greek debt.
By the time the eurozone governments intervened decisively, most French and German banks had largely unloaded their holdings at a loss to hedge funds and other investors with a greater appetite for risk.
Whatever debt they had held onto lost more than half its value in the haircut.
Given this, it cannot be said that French and German banks did not suffer losses.
Similarly, the creditor countries were right that they had helped Greece, a country that had undeniably overspent for years.
Their financial assistance allowed Greece to reduce its fiscal deficits more slowly than if it had simply gone bankrupt in 2010, as it enabled the country to remain connected to financial markets.
In the first quarter of last year, Greece actually experienced a slight uptick in growth and a small decline in unemployment.
What the creditors overlooked was that, over time, the pain of austerity began – in the minds of many Greeks – to outweigh the benefits of their assistance.
Until a few months ago, it still looked as if Greece could achieve a primary surplus, albeit a small one, this year.
When the country turned to its creditors for help, it was only because it could not cover some large payments on maturing loans.
Greece had ceased to be a “bottomless pit.”
With a bit of financial engineering, Greece’s creditors could have postponed some of the payments the country owed this year – payments that, it should be noted, everyone knew it would not be able to repay at this stage – and enabled it to continue its gradual recovery.
Instead, these clashing narratives created a deleterious spiral, fanning the flames of animosity and leading to the election of a left-wing government in Greece with a mandate to oppose austerity – with disastrous results for both sides.
Rather than help Greece make its payments, the creditors reacted by imposing tough conditions for a new loan that would be used only to repay debts that they themselves held – a point that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras emphasized in his last proposal.
And yet, blaming the creditors for their “punitive” conditions, as Greek negotiators have done, would also be a mistake, for this simplistic narrative too obscures a complicated truth.
Right before the talks were abruptly cut off for Greece to hold its referendum, the two sides had agreed on fiscal targets for Greece; all that was left was to determine how the targets should be reached.
The Greek government wanted to raise some taxes.
Its creditors believed that this approach would stifle growth even more, so they advocated increasing the tax base, such as by eliminating the lower value-added tax rates enjoyed by Greek islands, instead.
Though the creditors’ logic was sound and their intentions laudable, the Greek side believed that such a condition would amount to an affront to their country’s sovereignty.
With that, their narrative morphed into one of national pride.
It was a classic “prisoner’s dilemma.”
Both sides have known throughout the tortuous negotiations of recent months that failure to reach an agreement would benefit no one.
Greece’s economy would contract even further, and its creditors would have to accept even larger write-offs.
But the two sides have remained locked in their respective narratives – narratives that the recent cutoff of negotiations and hastily arranged referendum have reinforced.
Now, the Greek electorate is rejecting the creditors’ demands in the name of national pride, democracy, and sovereignty; the creditors are angry not only at their attitude, but also at their government’s unreliability.
Saving Greece was always going to be difficult, given its previous fiscal excesses and weak economy.
But last year, it seemed that success was within reach – until the clash of narratives derailed the progress the two sides had made.
This highlights a larger problem: the European Union lacks a unifying narrative strong enough to prevent the emergence of conflicting – and highly destructive – narratives within its borders.
In this sense, the failure to save Greece amounts to a failure of Europe.
Getting Personal With the Greek Crisis
BERLIN – Today’s decision-makers are supposed to embrace the virtues of big data, relentlessly pursue quantitative metrics, and then adhere to the optimal course of action that these powerful tools supposedly indicate.
Yet if there is one thing that the Greek crisis has made clear, it is the importance of the human factor in negotiations.
People and their personalities, and the way they perceive one another, can make small debts seem unserviceable or large debts disappear with a handshake.
In a world that feels increasingly unstable, many seek reassurance in the illusion of certainty that data provide.
We want it in our journalism.
We want it in our investment decisions.
We even want gadgets that count our every step and heartbeat.
We want to bring our wellbeing and our future fully under our control.
But the Greek financial crisis serves as a reminder that life is not governed by data alone.
In the end, outcomes may – and often do – depend on the amorphous yet essential qualities of integrity, trustworthiness, and interpersonal “chemistry.”
The importance of such factors was no less clear in the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.
Whereas partisan grandstanding and nationalist posturing in the Greek negotiations have eroded confidence in the entire European project, the negotiators on the Iran deal overcame an even deeper trust gap.
With arguably more at stake, and despite the involvement of more players with overlapping and, at times, antagonistic agendas, entrusting the process to professional diplomats, rather than elected politicians, clearly paid off.
There is an important lesson here for Europe.
People selected to lead countries or companies must have the technical competence – and the number-crunching support teams – needed to make good decisions.
But that is never enough.
Effective leaders must be able not only to represent a point of view, but also to work well with others to realize their vision.
If deals – whether on bailout arrangements, nuclear programs, or corporate mergers – could be concluded on the basis of quantitative data alone, they would be.
But they never are.
For Greece and its creditors now, the latest agreement is only the first step.
The six months of finger pointing and brinkmanship that preceded the deal have created a mountain of mistrust among leaders and citizens alike.
When multiple ceasefire agreements fail in South Sudan and eastern Ukraine, or a humanitarian truce in Yemen collapses within hours, one or more of the parties is said to lack “credible commitment.”
Similarly, when the Greek side proposes essentially the same deal that it just called a snap referendum to reject, or when the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, following Germany’s lead, simply ignores the unsustainability of Greece’s debt, the ability to execute any deal must be in doubt.
What will make this deal work is quick ratification and credible follow-through in terms of day-to-day implementation.
Both sides need incentives to stick with it and deterrents to defecting from it.
Above all, conditioning further, essential debt relief for Greece on its execution of the deal should be used as a way to commit both sides.
A track record of failed implementation – of accepting bailouts without implementing the reforms needed to regain solvency – creates a climate in which deal making becomes ever more difficult.
The risks are too high, especially when every development in the talks is spun for partisan advantage, to make leaders look smart, to label winners and losers, or to undermine progress by nit-picking the data.
It is to the credit of European leaders involved in the negotiations that they have been able to reach a deal in the face of enormous uncertainty.
They have committed not just financial resources but also significant political capital at a make-or-break moment for Europe.
Given the lack of trust between the parties to the deal, the situation will remain extremely volatile for some time.
Quantitative data will be necessary to monitor Greece’s progress on carrying out the agreed reforms, as well as to determine the extent of further debt relief.
But neither Greece nor Europe will regain a sense of stability merely because the data add up.
Their leaders’ personal qualities – their unshakable will and determination to make the deal stick – must add up, too.
Greece’s Imperfect Imperative
LONDON – Greece and its creditors are now enacting a deal that provides financial support in exchange for wide-ranging reforms.
Although reservations about the agreement abound, political conditions did not permit a better one.
But the deal can – and must – serve as the basis for saving Greece and the eurozone.
For the plan to work, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must show real commitment to a reform program in which neither he nor many Greek citizens believe.
And he must forge an alliance with Greece’s pro-European parties, because only a united government will be able to deliver.
The creditors must find the money to fund the bailout.
And the International Monetary Fund must agree with the Eurogroup on how to restore debt sustainability in Greece, a precondition for the country to regain access to capital markets.
In this effort, a critical distinction must be made: though Greece has committed to deep and rapid reform, it must not be forced into hurried fiscal consolidation.
Indeed, such an approach could undermine urgently needed structural reforms, not least by destroying the political capital required to enact them.
Unfortunately, the recent agreement includes unrealistic proposals for fiscal adjustment.
Before Greek banks closed and capital controls were imposed in late June, the European Commission put the primary budget deficit for this year at €4-6 billion ($4.3-6.5 billion), or 2-3% of GDP.
Now, it looks like the primary deficit (which excludes interest payments) could reach 6% of GDP, with GDP falling by 4%.
Yet the new deal anticipates that Greece will make up for the year’s fiscal shortfall in just five months.
As Greece and other eurozone countries have already learned, attempting to rush fiscal adjustment increases the debt burden, as the liquidity squeeze and concomitant uncertainty undermine output and reform efforts.
For example, one of the key initiatives to address the fiscal shortfall is an increase in the value-added tax to 23% for almost all goods and services.
But with VAT evasion in Greece as high as 50%, the hike will place firms that pay, which tend to be larger and more efficient, at an even greater disadvantage relative to firms that do not.
Greece should therefore focus first on building the legal and technical infrastructure to combat tax evasion.
Greece’s government will find it hard to adhere to the new program unless its fiscal targets make sense.
Though it is politically unrealistic to renegotiate the deal at this point, a serious analysis of the necessary fiscal adjustment, possibly arbitrated by independent experts, is needed.
The IMF’s latest analysis of Greece’s debt sustainability reinforces this assessment.
Despite pressure from Germany and other countries to participate in the new bailout program, the Fund will not get involved unless it judges Greece’s debt to be sustainable.
That means making the economy’s debt stocks and fiscal flows consistent, with the right combination of tough but feasible fiscal targets and debt relief.
Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
Implementation will be very difficult even without excessively tight fiscal targets; with them, it may be impossible.
Previous attempts at pension reform, for example, have been partial and indecisive, with exceptions and grace periods undermining their effectiveness.
Similarly, though attempts to reform the code of civil procedure, aimed at improving the judicial system’s efficiency, began in 2011, little progress has been made, owing largely to the government’s failure to face down opposition from lawyers’ associations, which stand to lose their excessive fees from useless procedures.
And, although the groundwork has been laid for product-market reforms, no preparations for serious public-administration reform have been made.
The key to overcoming these challenges is for the Greek people to take ownership of the reforms, so that the public interest can prevail over vested interests.
But that, too, will be difficult, given the widespread view that the reforms are being imposed on Greece by its creditors.
Tsipras must lead the way by building a broad consensus.
The details of the reform legislation are important.
Rather than attempting to meet unfeasible deadlines, legislators should proceed with deliberate speed.
Meanwhile, Greek banks – which, given their huge volume of non-performing loans, are now more likely to be insolvent than illiquid – will require massive recapitalization, funded by the European Stability Mechanism, not the Greek state, in order to break the bank-sovereign link.
The operation might involve restructuring as well.
In this effort, there must be no bail-in of depositors, which would have damaging social consequences, or Greek state ownership of the banks, which would entrench clientelism in the financial system.
The ESM would later sell the banks in open auctions to recoup its investment.
Many in Greece, as well as some outsiders, have called the new agreement “neocolonialist oppression.”
And, indeed, Greece’s humiliation in the negotiations evoked memories of the Indonesian president’s treatment by the IMF during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
(Some creditors feel that they are the true victims, exploited by Greek counterparts who never intended to fulfill their promises.)
But the Greeks must put aside these emotional responses and recognize the need for many of the proposed reforms.
Greece’s failure to implement them has allowed the clientelism, oligarchy, corruption, and tax evasion underpinning its economic and political dysfunction to continue practically unfettered.
The alternative is a Greek exit from the eurozone.
(German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s suggestion that Greece can just take a “time out” is a fiction.)
Economists who pretend that this would be anything less than an economic and political catastrophe for Greece should look closely at the structure of Greek trade, the anemic response of exports to the already huge internal devaluation, and company and household balance sheets.
Some would welcome the damage this would do to European unity; we would not.
The recent agreement is far from ideal.
But Greece and its creditors must make it work.
Saving Greece, Saving Europe
BERKELEY – Whatever one thinks about the tactics of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government in negotiations with the country’s creditors, the Greek people deserve better than what they are being offered.
Germany wants Greece to choose between economic collapse and leaving the eurozone.
Both options would mean economic disaster; the first, if not both, would be politically disastrous as well.
When I wrote in 2007 that no member state would voluntarily leave the eurozone, I emphasized the high economic costs of such a decision.
The Greek government has shown that it understands this.
Following the referendum, it agreed to what it – and the voters – had just rejected: a set of very painful and difficult conditions.
Tsipras and his new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, have gone to extraordinary lengths to mollify Greece’s creditors.
But when I concluded that no country would leave the eurozone, I failed to imagine that Germany would force another member out.
This, clearly, would be the effect of the politically intolerable and economically perverse conditions tabled by Germany’s finance ministry.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea of a temporary “time out” from the euro is ludicrous.
Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.
It is inconceivable that a country in such deep distress could meet the conditions for euro adoption – inflation within 2% of the eurozone average and a stable exchange rate for two years – between now and the end of the decade.
If Grexit occurs, it will not be a holiday; it will be a retirement.
Early Monday morning, European leaders agreed to remove the reference to this “time out” from the announcement of the latest bailout deal.
But this door, having been opened, will not now be easily closed.
The Eurosystem has been rendered more fragile and subject to destabilization.
Other European finance ministers will have to answer for agreeing to forward to their leaders a provisional draft containing Schäuble’s destructive language.
Economically, the new program is perverse, because it will plunge Greece deeper into depression.
It envisages raising additional taxes, cutting pensions further, and implementing automatic spending cuts if fiscal targets are missed.
But it provides no basis for recovery or growth.
The Greek economy is already in free-fall, and structural reforms alone will not reverse the downward spiral.
The agreement continues to require primary budget surpluses (net of interest payments), rising to 3.5% of GDP by 2018, which will worsen Greece’s slump.
Re-profiling the country’s debt, which is implicitly part of the agreement, will do nothing to ameliorate this, given that interest payments already are minimal through the end of the decade.
As the depression deepens, the deficit targets will be missed, triggering further spending cuts and accelerating the economy’s contraction.
Eventually, the agreement will trigger Grexit, either because the creditors withdraw their support after fiscal targets are missed, or because the Greek people rebel.
Triggering that exit is transparently Germany’s intent.
Finally, the privatization fund at the center of the new program will do nothing to encourage structural reform.
Yes, Greece needs to privatize inefficient public enterprises.
But the Greek government is being asked to privatize with a gun held to its head.
Privatization at fire-sale prices, with most of the proceeds used to pay down debt, will not put Greek parliamentarians or the public in a mood to press ahead enthusiastically with structural reform.
Greece deserves better.
It deserves a program that respects its sovereignty and allows the government to establish its credibility over time.
It deserves a program capable of stabilizing its economy rather than bleeding it to death.
And it deserves support from the ECB to enable it to remain a eurozone member.
Europe deserves better, too.
Other European countries should not in good conscience accede to this politically destructive, economically perverse program.
They should remind themselves that Greece had plenty of help from its European partners in getting to this point.
They must continue to push for a better deal.
These partners should not allow the European project to be sacrificed on the altar of German public opinion or German leaders’ insistence on “rules.”
If Germany’s government refuses to see the light, the others should find a way forward without it.
Franco-German solidarity would be irreparably damaged, but Franco-German solidarity is worth nothing if the best it can produce is this agreement.
Last but not least, the German public deserve better.
Germans deserve a leader who stands firm in the face of extremism, rather than encouraging it, whether at home or abroad.
They deserve a Europe that can play a greater role in global affairs.
Above all, given Germany’s stunning political and economic achievements since World War II, they deserve their fellow Europeans’ admiration and respect, not renewed resentment and suspicion.
A Way Out for Greece
QUITO – The Greek crisis is a tragedy for the country and a danger for the world economy.
Germany is demanding that Greece continue to service its debts in full, even though Greece is clearly broke and the International Monetary Fund has noted the need for debt relief.
The collision of reality (Greece’s insolvency) with politics (Germany’s demands) was bound to create a disaster.
And, indeed, it has: the shocking collapse this week of the Greek banking system.
Yet there still is a way out of this mess.
Greece’s debt should be cut sharply, and the country should remain within the eurozone.
In negotiations with its creditors this spring, Greece recognized this, insisting that its debt be reduced.
Germany refused.
Though the United States and the IMF privately sided with Greece, Germany prevailed, as creditors usually do.
Yet creditors sometimes prevail to their own detriment; by pushing the debtor to the breaking point, they end up bringing about a complete default.
Germany’s mistake this past week was to push the Greek economy – already in conditions rivaling those of the Great Depression – into a complete financial collapse.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has a clear negotiating strategy, aimed at getting Greece to agree to leave the eurozone.
Unfortunately for him, Greece does not want to exit, and it cannot be forced to do so under the treaties governing the European Union.
What Greece wants is to remain in the eurozone, with a lower debt burden – a position that is both economically astute and protected by treaty.
Indeed, a euro exit would be remarkably costly for Greece, and would almost certainly create political and social chaos – and perhaps even hyperinflation – in the heart of Europe.
The value of Greek residents’ savings would be slashed, as euros were suddenly converted into New Drachmas.
The middle class would be eviscerated.
And the currency conversion would not save the country one cent with regard to its external debt, which would, of course, remain denominated in euros.
Still, Greece’s debt burden is unsustainable.
This week, Greece defaulted on its payments to the IMF, rightly choosing pensions over debt service.
The country’s creditors should now negotiate a consensual debt reduction through some combination of lower (and fixed) interest rates, reduced face value of debt, and very long maturities.
There are plenty of precedents for such a course.
Sovereign debts have been restructured hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times – including for Germany.
In fact, hardline demands by the country’s US government creditors after World War I contributed to deep financial instability in Germany and other parts of Europe, and indirectly to the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1933.
After World War II, however, Germany was the recipient of vastly wiser concessions by the US government, culminating in consensual debt relief in 1953, an action that greatly benefitted Germany and the world.
Yet Germany has failed to learn the lessons of its own history.
I propose a four-step path out of the Greek crisis.
First, I recommend that the Greek people give a resounding “No” to the creditors in the referendum on their demands this weekend.
Second, Greece should continue to withhold service on its external debts to official creditors in advance of a consensual debt restructuring later this year.
Given its great depression, Greece should use its savings to pay pensioners, provide food relief, make crucial infrastructure repairs, and direct liquidity toward the banking system.
Third, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must use his persuasive powers to convince the public, in the style of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself.
Specifically, the government should make clear to all Greeks that their euro deposits are safe; that the country will remain within the eurozone (despite the false claims by some members of the Eurogroup that a no vote means a Greek exit); and that its banks will reopen immediately after the referendum.
Finally, Greece and Germany need to come to a rapprochement soon after the referendum and agree to a package of economic reforms and debt relief.
No country – including Greece – should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth, to the benefit of both debtor and creditor.
And yet, a corpse cannot carry out reforms.
That is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together, not reforms “first” with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future (as some in Europe have said to Greece).
To be sure, in the Greek debacle, both sides have made countless mistakes, misjudgments, and misdeeds over the last decade, and even before.
A country does not reach Greece’s parlous state without a generation of egregious mismanagement.
But nor does a country go bankrupt without serious mistakes by its creditors – first in lending too much money, and then in demanding excessive repayments to the point of the debtor’s collapse.
With both sides at fault, it is important for them not to lose the future by squabbling endlessly over the past.
Easing Greece’s debt burden while keeping the country within the eurozone is the correct and achievable path out of the crisis, and it can be accomplished easily through a mutual accord between Germany and Greece, to which the rest of Europe will subscribe.
The result would be a win not only for those countries, but also for the world economy.
A New Deal for Greece
ATHENS – Three months of negotiations between the Greek government and our European and international partners have brought about much convergence on the steps needed to overcome years of economic crisis and to bring about sustained recovery in Greece.
But they have not yet produced a deal.
What steps are needed to produce a viable, mutually agreed reform agenda?
We and our partners already agree on much.
Greece’s tax system needs to be revamped, and the revenue authorities must be freed from political and corporate influence.
The pension system is ailing.
The economy’s credit circuits are broken.
The labor market has been devastated by the crisis and is deeply segmented, with productivity growth stalled.
Public administration is in urgent need of modernization, and public resources must be used more efficiently.
Overwhelming obstacles block the formation of new companies.
Competition in product markets is far too circumscribed.
And inequality has reached outrageous levels, preventing society from uniting behind essential reforms.
This consensus aside, agreement on a new development model for Greece requires overcoming two hurdles.
First, we must concur on how to approach Greece’s fiscal consolidation.
Second, we need a comprehensive, commonly agreed reform agenda that will underpin that consolidation path and inspire the confidence of Greek society.
Beginning with fiscal consolidation, the issue at hand concerns the method.
The “troika” institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) have, over the years, relied on a process of backward induction: They set a date (say, the year 2020) and a target for the ratio of nominal debt to national income (say, 120%) that must be achieved before money markets are deemed ready to lend to Greece at reasonable rates.
Then, under arbitrary assumptions regarding growth rates, inflation, privatization receipts, and so forth, they compute what primary surpluses are necessary in every year, working backward to the present.
The result of this method, in our government’s opinion, is an “austerity trap.”
When fiscal consolidation turns on a predetermined debt ratio to be achieved at a predetermined point in the future, the primary surpluses needed to hit those targets are such that the effect on the private sector undermines the assumed growth rates and thus derails the planned fiscal path.
Indeed, this is precisely why previous fiscal-consolidation plans for Greece missed their targets so spectacularly.
Our government’s position is that backward induction should be ditched.
Instead, we should map out a forward-looking plan based on reasonable assumptions about the primary surpluses consistent with the rates of output growth, net investment, and export expansion that can stabilize Greece’s economy and debt ratio.
If this means that the debt-to-GDP ratio will be higher than 120% in 2020, we devise smart ways to rationalize, re-profile, or restructure the debt – keeping in mind the aim of maximizing the effective present value that will be returned to Greece’s creditors.
Besides convincing the troika that our debt sustainability analysis should avoid the austerity trap, we must overcome the second hurdle: the “reform trap.”
The previous reform program, which our partners are so adamant should not be “rolled back” by our government, was founded on internal devaluation, wage and pension cuts, loss of labor protections, and price-maximizing privatization of public assets.
Our partners believe that, given time, this agenda will work.
If wages fall further, employment will rise.
The way to cure an ailing pension system is to cut pensions.
And privatizations should aim at higher sale prices to pay off debt that many (privately) agree is unsustainable.
By contrast, our government believes that this program has failed, leaving the population weary of reform.
The best evidence of this failure is that, despite a huge drop in wages and costs, export growth has been flat (the elimination of the current-account deficit being due exclusively to the collapse of imports).
Additional wage cuts will not help export-oriented companies, which are mired in a credit crunch.
And further cuts in pensions will not address the true causes of the pension system’s troubles (low employment and vast undeclared labor).
Such measures will merely cause further damage to Greece’s already-stressed social fabric, rendering it incapable of providing the support that our reform agenda desperately needs.
The current disagreements with our partners are not unbridgeable.
Our government is eager to rationalize the pension system (for example, by limiting early retirement), proceed with partial privatization of public assets, address the non-performing loans that are clogging the economy’s credit circuits, create a fully independent tax commission, and boost entrepreneurship.
The differences that remain concern how we understand the relationships between the various reforms and the macro environment.
None of this means that common ground cannot be achieved immediately.
The Greek government wants a fiscal-consolidation path that makes sense, and we want reforms that all sides believe are important.
Our task is to convince our partners that our undertakings are strategic, rather than tactical, and that our logic is sound.
Their task is to let go of an approach that has failed.
A New Deal for Debt Overhangs?
CAMBRIDGE – The International Monetary Fund’s acknowledgement that Greece’s debt is unsustainable could prove to be a watershed moment for the global financial system.
Clearly, heterodox policies to deal with high debt burdens need to be taken more seriously, even in some advanced countries.
Ever since the onset of the Greek crisis, there have been basically three schools of thought.
First, there is the view of the so-called troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the IMF), which holds that the eurozone’s debt-distressed periphery (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) requires strong policy discipline to prevent a short-term liquidity crisis from morphing into a long-term insolvency problem.
The orthodox policy prescription was to extend conventional bridge loans to these countries, thereby giving them time to fix their budget problems and undertake structural reforms aimed at enhancing their long-term growth potential.
This approach has “worked” in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, but at the cost of epic recessions. Moreover, there is a high risk of relapse in the event of a significant downturn in the global economy.
The troika policy has, however, failed to stabilize, much less revive, Greece’s economy.
A second school of thought also portrays the crisis as a pure liquidity problem, but views long-term insolvency as an outside risk at worst.
The problem is not that the debt of countries on the eurozone’s periphery is too high, but that it has not been allowed to rise nearly high enough.
This anti-austerity camp believes that even when private markets totally lost confidence in Europe’s periphery, northern Europe could easily have solved the problem by co-signing periphery debt, perhaps under the umbrella of Eurobonds backed ultimately by all (especially German) eurozone taxpayers.
The periphery countries should then have been permitted not only to roll over their debt, but also to engage in full-on countercyclical fiscal policy for as long as their national governments deemed necessary.
In other words, for “anti-austerians,” the eurozone suffered a crisis of competence, not a crisis of confidence.
Never mind that the eurozone has no centralized fiscal authority and only an incomplete banking union.
Never mind moral-hazard problems or insolvency.
And never mind growth-enhancing structural reforms.
All of the debtors will be good for the money in the future, even if they have not always been reliable in the past.
In any case, faster GDP growth will pay for everything, thanks to high fiscal multipliers.
Europe passed up a free lunch.
This is a fully coherent viewpoint, but naive in its unqualified confidence (for example, in the polemical writings of the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman).
As a result, the anti-austerian view masks strong assumptions and risks.
In fact, piling loans atop already-high debt burdens in the eurozone’s periphery entailed a significant gamble, particularly as the crisis erupted.
Political corruption, exemplified by the revolving door between Spain’s government and financial sector, was endemic.
Dual labor markets and product-market monopolies still hobble growth, and oligarchs have disproportionate power to protect their interests.
In reality, Germany could not have underwritten all of the European periphery’s debt without risking its own solvency and creditworthiness, particularly in the absence of a functioning system of eurozone-wide checks and balances.
Expansive and open-ended guarantees might have worked, but if they didn’t, the economic rot from the periphery could have spread to the center.
A third point of view is that, given the massive financial crisis, Europe’s debt problem should have been diagnosed as an insolvency problem from the start, and treated with debt restructuring and forgiveness, aided by moderately elevated inflation and structural reform.
This has been my viewpoint since the crisis began.
In Ireland and Spain, private bondholders, not Irish and Spanish taxpayers, should have taken the hit from bank failures.
In Greece, there should have been faster and larger debt write-downs.
Of course, national governments would have had to use taxpayer funds to recapitalize northern European banks – especially in France and Germany – that lent too much to the periphery.
And transfers would have been needed to recapitalize the periphery banks.
But at least then the public would have understood the reality of the situation, while restructured and recapitalized banks would have been in a position to start lending again.
Unfortunately, too many policymakers in advanced economies allowed themselves to believe that such heterodox policies are only for emerging markets.
In fact, advanced countries have resorted to heterodox policies to reduce debt overhangs on many occasions.
Debt restructuring would have given Europe the reset it needed.
Yes, there would have been risks, as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard has pointed out, but running those risks would have been well worth it.
So what is the way forward?
Deeper European integration, stricter equity requirements for banks, and deeper but homegrown structural reforms are certainly key elements of any solution.
Further aid to the European periphery is still badly needed.
But, beyond that, Europe’s experience ought to spur a full rethink of the global system for administering sovereign bankruptcies.
That could mean bringing back older IMF proposals for a sovereign bankruptcy mechanism, or finding ways to institutionalize the Fund’s recent stance on Greek debt.
There is no free lunch in Europe, and there never was; but there are much better ways to deal with unsustainable debt.
The Threat of Greek Debt Relief
BERLIN – With Greece’s economic crisis still raging, prominent voices, ranging from Nobel laureate economists like Paul Krugman to officials like US Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, are calling for more lenient bailout terms and debt relief.
Even the International Monetary Fund – which, along with other European lenders, has provided Greece with emergency financing – recently joined that call.
But could such an approach really be the proverbial silver bullet for Greece’s crisis?
The short answer is no.
While Greece’s public debt is undeniably high, and evidence abounds that high debt can hold back economic growth, the country faces even stronger drags on growth, including structural weaknesses and political brinkmanship, that must be addressed first.
In fact, Greece will likely depend on concessional funding from official sources in the years ahead – funding that is conditional on reforms, not debt ratios.
Greece’s nominal debt stock will matter only once the country re-enters the debt markets and becomes subject to market, not concessional, borrowing terms.
In the meantime, Greece must implement the structural reforms needed to restore the country’s long-term growth prospects and thus to strengthen its capacity to repay its creditors without a large nominal debt reduction.
But there is another critical reason why debt relief is not the answer, and it lies in the political architecture of the European Monetary Union.
Because the eurozone lacks a strong central governing body, crisis policies emerge from a political process in which each of the 19 member states has veto power.
For such a complex system to work, eurozone policymakers must be able to trust one another to behave in a particular way – and that requires a common framework of rules and standards.
A restructuring of Greece’s official debt, despite offering short-term benefits, would weaken that framework in the long run by setting a precedent for exceptions, with other eurozone countries, sooner or later, requesting the same concession.
In 2013, the extension of Greece’s loan maturities prompted Ireland and Portugal to demand – and receive – comparable extensions, despite their less obvious need.
Instead of offering concessions, which could create long-term instability in the eurozone, Europe’s leaders must remain committed to creating strong incentives for all member states to maintain prudent fiscal policies capable of reducing public-debt ratios and restoring fiscal buffers against asymmetric shocks to the currency union.
Only then will the eurozone have a chance of upholding the Lisbon Treaty’s “no bailout” clause.
Greece may account for less than 2% of eurozone GDP, but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union.
To prevent such an outcome, it is critical that any solution to the Greek crisis reinforces, rather than undermines, the eurozone’s cohesion.
It is true that Greece has had to undergo painful adjustments to address its deep structural weaknesses, unsustainable public finances, and lack of price competitiveness – adjustments that led to a drop in Greek output.
But high unemployment and a lack of investment cannot be blamed on the medicine prescribed; they are symptoms of the country’s failure to reform its public administration and to enhance the flexibility of its economy.
The international debate about how much austerity is appropriate to balance the interests of Greece and its creditors has distracted policymakers for too long.
It is time to focus on the real imperative: designing and implementing vital structural reforms, at the national and European levels.
To guide this process, the German Council of Economic Experts, which I chair, has developed a set of reforms – called “Maastricht 2.0” – that would reinforce the rules-based framework that is so essential to the eurozone’s long-term success.
For example, the banking union needs to be strengthened through an enhanced resolution regime and an integrated financial supervisor, and a sovereign insolvency mechanism should be introduced.
Underpinning the proposed reforms is the so-called “principle of unity of liability and control,” which demands that both the power to make decisions and liability for their consequences are kept at the same political level, be it national or supranational.
In other words, if countries want to make their own fiscal decisions independent of their eurozone partners, they cannot expect those partners to step in and save them later.
To be sure, in recent years, the European institutional framework has undergone major reforms that reflect the principles of “Maastricht 2.0,” such as the need to emphasize national responsibility for public finances and international competitiveness.
But the reform process remains far from complete.
There is no denying that short-term measures to address acute problems – such as debt relief for Greece – threaten the eurozone’s long-term stability.
If the European Monetary Union is to survive and ultimately thrive, its leaders must not be tempted by facile solutions.
The Lethal Deferral of Greek Debt Restructuring
ATHENS – The point of restructuring debt is to reduce the volume of new loans needed to salvage an insolvent entity.
Creditors offer debt relief to get more value back and to extend as little new finance to the insolvent entity as possible.
Remarkably, Greece’s creditors seem unable to appreciate this sound financial principle.
Where Greek debt is concerned, a clear pattern has emerged over the past five years. It remains unbroken to this day.
In 2010, Europe and the International Monetary Fund extended loans to the insolvent Greek state equal to 44% of the country’s GDP.
The very mention of debt restructuring was considered inadmissible and a cause for ridiculing those of us who dared suggest its inevitability.
In 2012, as the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketed, Greece’s private creditors were given a significant 34% haircut.
At the same time, however, new loans worth 63% of GDP were added to Greece’s national debt.
A few months later, in November, the Eurogroup (comprising eurozone members’ finance ministers) indicated that debt relief would be finalized by December 2014, once the 2012 program was “successfully” completed and the Greek government’s budget had attained a primary surplus (which excludes interest payments).
In 2015, however, with the primary surplus achieved, Greece’s creditors refused even to discuss debt relief.
For five months, negotiations remained at an impasse, culminating in the July 5 referendum in Greece, in which voters overwhelmingly rejected further austerity, and the Greek government’s subsequent surrender, formalized in the July 12 Euro Summit agreement.
That agreement, which is now the blueprint for Greece’s relationship with the eurozone, perpetuates the five-year-long pattern of placing debt restructuring at the end of a sorry sequence of fiscal tightening, economic contraction, and program failure.
Indeed, the sequence of the new “bailout” envisaged in the July 12 agreement predictably begins with the adoption – before the end of the month – of harsh tax measures and medium-term fiscal targets equivalent to another bout of stringent austerity.
Then comes a mid-summer negotiation of another large loan, equivalent to 48% of GDP (the debt-to-GDP ratio is already above 180%).
Finally, in November, at the earliest, and after the first review of the new program is completed, “the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, if necessary, possible additional measures… aiming at ensuring that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.”
During the negotiations to which I was a party, from January 25 to July 5, I repeatedly suggested to our creditors a series of smart debt swaps.
The aim was to minimize the amount of new funding required from the European Stability Mechanism and the IMF to refinance Greek debt, and to ensure that Greece would become eligible within 2015 for the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase program (quantitative easing), effectively restoring Greece’s access to capital markets.
We estimated that no more than €30 billion ($33 billion, or 17% of GDP) of new, ESM-sourced financing would be required, none of which would be needed for the Greek state’s primary budget.
Our proposals were not rejected.
Although we had it on good authority that they were technically rigorous and legally sound, they simply were never discussed.
The political will of the Eurogroup was to ignore our proposals, let the negotiations fail, impose an indefinite bank holiday, and force the Greek government to acquiesce on everything – including a massive new loan that is almost triple the size we had proposed.
Once again, Greece’s creditors put the cart before the horse, by insisting that the new loan be agreed before any discussion of debt relief.
As a result, the new loan deemed necessary grew inexorably, as in 2010 and 2012.
Unsustainable debt is, sooner or later, written down.
But the precise timing and nature of that write-down makes an enormous difference for a country’s economic prospects.
And Greece is in the throes of a humanitarian crisis today because the inevitable restructuring of its debt has been used as an excuse for postponing that restructuring ad infinitum.
As a high-ranking European Commission official once asked me: “Your debt will be cut come hell or high water, so why are you expending precious political capital to insist that we deliver the restructuring now?”
The answer ought to have been obvious.
An ex ante debt restructuring that reduces the size of any new loans and renders the debt sustainable before any reforms are implemented stands a good chance of crowding in investment, stabilizing incomes, and setting the stage for recovery.
In sharp contrast, a debt write-down like Greece’s in 2012, which resulted from a program’s failure, only contributes to maintaining the downward spiral.
Why do Greece’s creditors refuse to move on debt restructuring before any new loans are negotiated?
And why do they prefer a much larger new loan package than necessary?
The answers to these questions cannot be found by discussing sound finance, public or private, for they reside firmly in the realm of power politics.
Debt is creditor power; and, as Greece has learned the hard way, unsustainable debt turns the creditor into Leviathan.
Life under it is becoming nasty, brutish and, for many of my compatriots, short.
Greece’s Two Currencies
ATHENS – Imagine a depositor in the US state of Arizona being permitted to withdraw only small amounts of cash weekly and facing restrictions on how much money he or she could wire to a bank account in California.
Such capital controls, if they ever came about, would spell the end of the dollar as a single currency, because such constraints are utterly incompatible with a monetary union.
Greece today (and Cyprus before it) offers a case study of how capital controls bifurcate a currency and distort business incentives.
The process is straightforward.
Once euro deposits are imprisoned within a national banking system, the currency essentially splits in two: bank euros (BE) and paper, or free, euros (FE).
Suddenly, an informal exchange rate between the two currencies emerges.
Consider a Greek depositor keen to convert a large sum of BE into FE (say, to pay for medical expenses abroad, or to repay a company debt to a non-Greek entity).
Assuming such depositors find FE holders willing to purchase their BE, a substantial BE-FE exchange rate emerges, varying with the size of the transaction, BE holders’ relative impatience, and the expected duration of capital controls.
On August 18, 2015, a few weeks after pulling the plug from Greece’s banks (thus making capital controls inevitable), the European Central Bank and its Greek branch, the Bank of Greece, actually formalized a dual-currency currency regime.
A government decree stated that “Transfer of the early, partial, or total prepayment of a loan in a credit institution is prohibited, excluding repayment by cash or remittance from abroad.”
The eurozone authorities thus permitted Greek banks to deny their customers the right to repay loans or mortgages in BE, thereby boosting the effective BE-FE exchange rate.
And, by continuing to allow payments of tax arrears to be made in BE, while prescribing FE as a separate, harder currency uniquely able to extinguish commercial bank debt, Europe’s authorities acknowledged that Greece now has two euros.
The real effects of the dual-currency regime on Greece’s economy and society can be gleaned only from the pernicious interaction between the capital controls and the “reforms” (essentially tax hikes, pension reductions, and other contractionary measures) imposed on the country by the eurozone authorities.
Consider the following beguiling example.
Greece’s companies fall roughly into two categories.
In one category are a large number of small firms asphyxiating under the tax office’s demand that they pay in advance, and immediately, 100% of next year’s corporate tax (as estimated by the tax authorities).
The second group comprises listed companies whose depressed turnover jeopardizes their already diminished share value and their standing with banks, suppliers, and potential customers (all of which are reluctant to sign long-term contracts with an underperforming company).
The coexistence, in the same depressed economy, of these two types of businesses gives rise to unexpected opportunities for shadowy trades without which countless businesses might close their doors permanently.
One widespread practice involves two such firms, say, Micro (a small family firm facing a large advance tax payment) and Macro (a publicly traded limited liability company that needs to demonstrate higher turnover than it has).
Macro agrees to issue invoices for (non-existent) goods or services rendered to Micro, up to, say, €20,000 ($22,000).
Micro agrees to pay €24,600 into Macro’s bank account (the price plus 23% value-added tax) on the understanding that Macro will reimburse the €20,000 to Micro.
This way, at a cost of €4,600, Micro reduces its taxable revenue by €24,600, while Macro boosts its turnover figure by €20,000.
Alas, due to capital controls, Macro cannot reimburse Micro in FE, nor can it wire €20,000 to Micro’s BE bank account (lest they be found out by the authorities).
So, to seal the deal, Micro and Macro approach a cash-rich vendor.
This is usually a gas-station owner who is flush with cash at the end of each day and who, for security reasons and in order to pay for his fuel supplies, is obliged to deposit his cash daily at his bank, turning valuable FEs into less valuable BEs.
The mutually beneficial deal is completed when Macro wires €20,000 in BE to the gas-station owner, who then hands over a smaller sum of FE (cash) to Micro’s owner, pocketing the difference.
The fact that this informal deal benefits all sides exposes the terrible inefficiency of current fiscal policy (namely, punitive business taxes) and how capital controls magnify it.
The state collects additional VAT from Micro (at a loss of corporate taxes that Micro cannot pay anyway); Macro enjoys the benefits of seemingly higher turnover; and the gas-station owner reduces his losses from converting FE into BE.
The downside is that economic activity is overstated and, more important, that reform becomes even harder as entrepreneurs internalize the necessity to find new, creative ways of bending the rules.
The sole purpose of the capital controls imposed on Greece last summer was to force the country’s rebellious government to capitulate to the eurozone’s failed policies.
But an unintended consequence was the formalization of two parallel (euro-denominated) currencies.
Combined with the punitive taxation caused by Europe’s refusal to recognize the unsustainability of Greek public debt, the dual-currency regime produces unforeseen incentives for informal transactions in a country that desperately needs to defeat informality.
The reality of Greece’s two currencies is the most vivid demonstration yet of the fragmentation of Europe’s monetary “union.”
In comparison, Arizona has never looked so good.
The Endgame in Greece
PARIS – After months of wrangling, the showdown between Greece and its European creditors has come down to a standoff over pensions and taxes.
Greece is refusing to acquiesce to demands by its creditors that it cut payments to the elderly and raise the value-added tax on their medicine and electricity.
Europe’s demands – ostensibly aimed at ensuring that Greece can service its foreign debt – are petulant, naive, and fundamentally self-destructive.
In rejecting them, the Greeks are not playing games; they are trying to stay alive.
Whatever one might say about Greece’s past economic policies, its uncompetitive economy, its decision to join the eurozone, or the errors that European banks made when they provided its government with excessive credit, the country’s economic plight is stark.
Unemployment stands at 25%.
Youth unemployment is at 50%.
Greece’s GDP, moreover, has shrunk by 25% since the start of the crisis in 2009.
Its government is insolvent.
Many of its citizens are hungry.
Conditions in Greece today are reminiscent of those in Germany in 1933.
Of course, the European Union need not fear the rise of a Greek Hitler, not only because it could easily crush such a regime, but also – and more important – because Greece’s democracy has proved impressively mature throughout the crisis.
But there is something that the EU should fear: destitution within its borders and the pernicious consequences for the continent’s politics and society.
Unfortunately, the continent remains split along tribal lines.
Germans, Finns, Slovaks, and Dutch – among others – have no time for the suffering of Greeks.
Their political leaders tend to their own, not to Europe in any true sense.
Relief for Greece is an especially fraught issue in countries where far-right parties are on the rise or center-right governments face popular left-wing opposition.
To be sure, European politicians are not blind to what is happening in Greece.
Nor have they been completely passive.
At the beginning of the crisis, Greece’s European creditors eschewed debt relief and charged punitive interest rates on bailout funds.
But, as Greeks’ suffering intensified, policymakers pressed private-sector banks and other bondholders to write off most of their claims.
At each stage of the crisis, they have done only what they believed their national politics would bear – no more.
In particular, Europe’s politicians are balking at steps that would implicate taxpayers directly.
The Greek government has asked Europe to swap existing debts with new debts to lock in low interest rates and long maturities.
It has also requested that interest payments be linked to economic growth.
(It has notably not asked for cuts in the face value of its debt).
But debt relief of this sort vis-à-vis European governments or the European Central Bank has been kept off the table.
Such measures would likely require parliamentary votes in countries across the eurozone, where many governments would face intense public opposition – no matter how obvious the need.
Rather than confront the political obstacles, Europe’s leaders are hiding behind a mountain of pious, nonsensical rhetoric.
Some insist that Greece finish its payment program, regardless of the humanitarian and economic consequences – not to mention the failure of all previous Greek governments to meet its terms.
Others pretend to worry about the moral-hazard implications of debt relief, despite the fact that the country’s private-sector debt has already been written off at EU insistence, and that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of precedents for restructuring the debts of insolvent sovereigns.
Almost a century ago, at World War I’s end, John Maynard Keynes offered a warning that holds great relevance today.
Then, as now, creditor countries (mainly the US) were demanding that deeply indebted countries make good on their debts.
Keynes knew that a tragedy was in the making.
“Will the discontented peoples of Europe be willing for a generation to come so to order their lives that an appreciable part of their daily produce may be available to meet a foreign payment?” he asked in The Economic Consequences of the Peace.
“In short, I do not believe that any of these tributes will continue to be paid, at the best, for more than a few years.”
Several European countries now seem content to force Greece into an outright default and provoke its exit from the euro.
They believe that the fallout can be contained without panic or contagion.
That is typical wishful thinking among politicians.
Indeed, it is the type of heedlessness that led US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to let Lehman Brothers fail in September 2008, ostensibly to teach the market a “lesson.”
Some lesson; we are still digging out from Paulson’s monumental mistake.
Similarly, Keynes watched in horror as economic policymakers blundered repeatedly in the years following WWI, through the upheavals of the 1920s, and into the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In 1925, Keynes criticized the insouciance of those “who sit in the top tier of the machine.”
He argued “that they are immensely rash in their regardlessness, in their vague optimism and comfortable belief that nothing really serious ever happens.
Nine times out of ten, nothing really serious does happen – merely a little distress to individuals or to groups.
But we run a risk of the tenth time…”
Today, Greece’s European creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on the irrevocability of the euro in order to insist on collecting some crumbs from the country’s pensioners.
Should they press their demands, forcing Greece to exit, the world will never again trust the euro’s longevity.
At a minimum, the eurozone’s weaker members will undergo increased market pressures.
In the worst case, they will be hit by a new vicious circle of panic and bank runs, also derailing the incipient European recovery.
With Russia testing Europe’s resolve to the east, the timing of Europe’s gamble could not be worse.
The Greek government is right to have drawn the line.
It has a responsibility to its citizens.
The real choice, after all, lies not with Greece, but with Europe.
A Greek Morality Tale
NEW YORK – When the euro crisis began a half-decade ago, Keynesian economists predicted that the austerity that was being imposed on Greece and the other crisis countries would fail.
It would stifle growth and increase unemployment – and even fail to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Others – in the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and a few universities – talked of expansionary contractions.
But even the International Monetary Fund argued that contractions, such as cutbacks in government spending, were just that – contractionary.
We hardly needed another test.
Austerity had failed repeatedly, from its early use under US President Herbert Hoover, which turned the stock-market crash into the Great Depression, to the IMF “programs” imposed on East Asia and Latin America in recent decades.
And yet when Greece got into trouble, it was tried again.
Greece largely succeeded in following the dictate set by the “troika” (the European Commission the ECB, and the IMF): it converted a primary budget deficit into a primary surplus.
But the contraction in government spending has been predictably devastating: 25% unemployment, a 22% fall in GDP since 2009, and a 35% increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
And now, with the anti-austerity Syriza party’s overwhelming election victory, Greek voters have declared that they have had enough.
So, what is to be done?
First, let us be clear: Greece could be blamed for its troubles if it were the only country where the troika’s medicine failed miserably.
But Spain had a surplus and a low debt ratio before the crisis, and it, too, is in depression.
What is needed is not structural reform within Greece and Spain so much as structural reform of the eurozone’s design and a fundamental rethinking of the policy frameworks that have resulted in the monetary union’s spectacularly bad performance.
Greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework.
Excessive debt caused not only the 2008 crisis, but also the East Asia crisis in the 1990s and the Latin American crisis in the 1980s.
It continues to cause untold suffering in the US, where millions of homeowners have lost their homes, and is now threatening millions more in Poland and elsewhere who took out loans in Swiss francs.
Given the amount of distress brought about by excessive debt, one might well ask why individuals and countries have repeatedly put themselves into this situation.
After all, such debts are contracts – that is, voluntary agreements – so creditors are just as responsible for them as debtors.
In fact, creditors arguably are more responsible: typically, they are sophisticated financial institutions, whereas borrowers frequently are far less attuned to market vicissitudes and the risks associated with different contractual arrangements.
Indeed, we know that US banks actually preyed on their borrowers, taking advantage of their lack of financial sophistication.
Every (advanced) country has realized that making capitalism work requires giving individuals a fresh start.
The debtors’ prisons of the nineteenth century were a failure – inhumane and not exactly helping to ensure repayment.
What did help was to provide better incentives for good lending, by making creditors more responsible for the consequences of their decisions.
At the international level, we have not yet created an orderly process for giving countries a fresh start.
Since even before the 2008 crisis, the United Nations, with the support of almost all of the developing and emerging countries, has been seeking to create such a framework.
But the US has been adamantly opposed; perhaps it wants to reinstitute debtor prisons for over indebted countries’ officials (if so, space may be opening up at Guantánamo Bay).
The idea of bringing back debtors’ prisons may seem far-fetched, but it resonates with current talk of moral hazard and accountability.
There is a fear that if Greece is allowed to restructure its debt, it will simply get itself into trouble again, as will others.
This is sheer nonsense.
Does anyone in their right mind think that any country would willingly put itself through what Greece has gone through, just to get a free ride from its creditors?
If there is a moral hazard, it is on the part of the lenders – especially in the private sector – who have been bailed out repeatedly.
If Europe has allowed these debts to move from the private sector to the public sector – a well-established pattern over the past half-century – it is Europe, not Greece, that should bear the consequences.
Indeed, Greece’s current plight, including the massive run-up in the debt ratio,&nbsp;is largely the fault of the misguided troika programs foisted on it.
So it is not debt restructuring, but its absence, that is “immoral.”
There is nothing particularly special about the dilemmas that Greece faces today; many&nbsp;countries have been in the same position.
What makes Greece’s problems more difficult to address is the structure of the eurozone: monetary union implies that member states cannot devalue their way out of trouble, yet the modicum of European solidarity that must accompany this loss of policy flexibility simply is not there.
Seventy years ago, at the end of World War&nbsp;II, the Allies recognized that Germany must be given a fresh start.
They understood that Hitler’s rise had much to do with the unemployment (not the inflation) that resulted from imposing more debt on Germany at the end of World War I. The Allies did not take into account the foolishness with which the debts had been accumulated or talk about the costs that Germany had imposed on others.
Instead, they not only forgave the debts; they actually provided aid, and the Allied troops stationed in Germany provided a further fiscal stimulus.
When companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution.
The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds.
If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less.
Both sides would then have a powerful incentive to pursue pro-growth policies.
Seldom do democratic elections give as clear a message as that in Greece.
If Europe says no to Greek voters’ demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics.
Why not just shut down democracy, as Newfoundland effectively did when it entered into receivership before World War II?
One hopes that those who understand the economics of debt and austerity, and who believe in democracy and humane values, will prevail.
Whether they will remains to be seen.
The Economic Consequences of Greece
TILTON – The first sentence of the 1957 Treaty of Rome – the founding document of what would eventually become the European Union – calls for “an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe."
Recently, however, that ideal has come under threat, undermined by its own political elite, which adopted a common currency while entirely neglecting the underlying fault lines.
Today, those cracks have been exposed – and widened – by the seemingly never-ending Greek crisis.
And nowhere are they more evident than in Greece's relationship with the International Monetary Fund.
When the euro crisis erupted in 2010, European officials realized that they lacked the necessary expertise to manage the threat of sovereign defaults and the potential breakup of the monetary union.
For EU officials, avoiding the eurozone's collapse became the top political imperative, so they turned to the IMF for help.
The irregularities in the Fund's resulting intervention attest to how serious the eurozone's problems were – and continue to be.
For starters, the IMF's Articles of Agreement require it to interact only with entities that are fully accountable for the help received: a member country's “treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency."
But the institutions with which the IMF is dealing in the eurozone are no longer responsible for their country's macroeconomic management; that power lies with the European Central Bank.
In lending to Greece, it is as if the Fund had lent to a sub-national unit, such as a provincial or city government, without insisting on repayment guarantees from the national authorities.
Another problem is the sheer magnitude of the Fund's intervention.
The size of the Greek debt necessitated lending on a scale far exceeding what other countries could expect.
The “exceptional access" to IMF resources granted to Greece in 2010 was set at a “cumulative limit of 600%" of the country's IMF quota, a measure of a country's financial commitment to the IMF.
Instead, in April 2013, cumulative financing was programmed to peak at 3,212% of Greece's quota.
The reason the IMF had to take on such huge exposure was Europe's initial refusal to contemplate debt reduction for Greece, owing to the authorities' fear that financial contagion would overwhelm the eurozone's firewall-free banking system.
That decision resulted in uncertainty about the currency union's capacity to resolve the crisis and aggravated the contraction in Greek output.
When a debt-restructuring agreement was finally reached in 2012, it provided a window for private creditors to reduce exposure by offloading their residual claims onto taxpayers.
Initially, the IMF took the official position that Greek debt was sustainable.
But IMF staff knew otherwise.
In 2013, the Fund admitted that its analysts knew that Greece's debt was not sustainable, but decided to go ahead with the program “because of the fear that spillovers from Greece would threaten the euro area and the global economy."
In addition, from November 2010 to April 2013, the IMF revised downward its forecast for 2014 Greek nominal GDP by 27%.
This cast doubt on the transparency and accountability of the Fund's debt-sustainability projections.
The implication is shocking: the IMF was unable to provide a credible framework for the adjustment that Greece would have to make.
This background provides crucial context for the ongoing negotiations, for it reveals that the aim of the Greek bailout was not to restore prosperity to the country's people, but to save the eurozone.
Given this, the new Greek government is entirely justified in questioning the terms that the country was given.
The agreements previous administrations made will certainly reduce the range of policies available to the new government, especially with respect to debt reduction, which would require a unilateral default and withdrawal from the eurozone.
But a democratically elected government need not be bound by its predecessors' commitments, and this is doubly true in the wake of an election that was a referendum on those very policies.
Ultimatums from unelected institutions that have compromised their own legitimacy have inflamed anti-EU sentiment across the continent.
The single worst outcome of the current negotiations would be Greece's submission to its creditors' demands, with few concessions in return.
Such a result would fuel greater public support for anti-EU parties and movements elsewhere, and would amount to a missed opportunity for Greece and Europe.
That opportunity is default and exit from the eurozone, which would allow Greece to begin correcting past mistakes and putting its economy on the path to recovery and sustainable growth.
At that point, the EU would be wise to follow suit, by unraveling the currency union and providing debt reduction for its most distressed economies.
Only then can the EU's founding ideals be realized.
Why Greece is Different
BRUSSELS – The seemingly interminable negotiations between the new Greek government and its international creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – on a new loan deal have entered a dangerous phase.
At this point, a mistake on either side threatens to trigger the kind of accident that could precipitate a new crisis in Europe.
The IMF seems ready to throw in the towel – not least because of the recent revelation that Greece could post a small primary budget deficit (which excludes interest payments) this year, rather than the planned sizeable surplus.
But, with Greece’s economy tanking again, its government is convinced that the current repayment program is not working – and that, in the absence of significant adjustments, it never will.
Fundamental to Greece’s case for new bailout terms is the narrative – reinforced by its current economic travails – that it has been a victim of excessive austerity.
But this neglects a crucial fact: austerity worked in Europe’s other crisis-hit countries.
Indeed, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and even Cyprus are showing clear signs of recovery, with unemployment finally falling (albeit slowly and from high levels) and access to capital markets restored.
Why is Greece different?
The short answer is exports.
In all of the other crisis-hit countries (and, indeed, in most of the dozens of countries that have received IMF loans in recent decades), rising exports offset, at least partly, the hit that demand took when their governments slashed spending and raised taxes to balance their books.
Of course, in a large economy where external financing is not a problem, as in the United States or the eurozone, attempting to reduce a budget deficit could conceivably lead to such a large decline in demand (and thus tax revenues) that austerity becomes self-defeating.
But this argument does not apply to Greece.
In fact, Greece was running very large current-account deficits – exceeding 10% of GDP – when external financing dried up suddenly in 2008-2009, forcing an adjustment in domestic spending.
If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment, domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher – but so would imports and large external deficits.
So, while austerity did cause a deep recession, it enabled Greece to avoid large external deficits, thereby reducing the size of the bailout the country needed.
Export performance is thus the key to escaping the austerity trap.
The problem for Greece is that what little export growth it has experienced lately is largely illusory, as it has come mostly from petroleum products.
Since Greece does not produce oil, this can mean only that Greek refiners, which now have considerable excess capacity, are simply exporting imported crude oil in a slightly different form.
With refinery margins typically less than 5%, the economy is gaining little added value from these exports.
Other exports that have increased, such as metals, raise a similar problem.
Moreover, Greece’s largest services export, maritime shipping, has few real links with the rest of the economy, given that companies in the sector pay no taxes and employ few Greeks (the crews hail from low-wage countries).
Undermining the sector’s economic contribution further is the fact that global commodity prices, on which shipping rates depend, have lately been declining.
Meanwhile, manufactured goods, which do add domestic value and employment, form only a small share of Greece’s overall exports.
In fact, Greece’s total foreign trade, if properly measured, amounts to only 12% of its GDP, much less than what one would expect from such a small economy.
More jarring is the fact that Greece’s total trade deficit (including both goods and services), was even higher in 2008, amounting to 13% of GDP, implying that, in order to avoid a subsequent decline in imports and thus in domestic demand, exports would have had to more than double.
In Portugal, by contrast, the trade deficit amounted to only about one-third of exports in 2008, meaning that exports had to increase by one-third to close the external deficit, without reducing imports.
Since then, Portugal has increased exports cumulatively by more than one-quarter, so that, despite a slight increase in imports since 2007, it runs a trade surplus.
To be sure, Greece’s trade deficit has declined, but only because imports collapsed.
Meanwhile, exports stagnated, even as wages declined by more than 20%.
That, not austerity, is Greece’s real problem.
If Greece had experienced the same growth in exports as Portugal (a country of similar size and per capita income), it would not have experienced such a deep recession, and tax revenues would have been higher, making it much easier for the government to achieve a primary budget surplus.
This suggests that a combination of fiscal consolidation, lower wages, and export-oriented reforms could have enabled Greece to move toward a sustainable recovery.
This approach has been tried before, and it has failed only once, when Argentina had to default on its foreign debt in 2002 and break a decade-long 1:1 peg to the US dollar.
Unfortunately, Greece resembles Argentina in two key respects.
Both countries have only a small export sector, which makes external adjustment much more difficult; and both have an export structure that is skewed toward commodities, the supply of which is unlikely to change much, even as structural reforms are pursued or wages decline.
Of course, this does not mean that Greece is doomed to follow in Argentina’s footsteps toward default.
But it does highlight the challenge that the country faces today – namely, to rebuild its export sector from the ground up.
It is time for Greece’s government to recognize this imperative and expand the scope of negotiations with its creditors to include not just the budget, but also strategies for stimulating exports.
But, first, Greece must finally recognize that austerity is not the enemy.
Austerity Is Not Greece’s Problem
CAMBRIDGE – When looking out a window, it is easy to be fooled by your own reflection and see more of yourself than the outside world.
This seems to be the case when US observers, influenced by their own country's fiscal debate, look at Greece.
For example, Joseph Stiglitz regards austerity in Greece as a matter of ideological choice or bad economics, just like in the US.
According to this view, those who favor austerity must be obsessed with the theory, given the availability of a kinder, gentler alternative.
Why would you ever vote for austerity when parties like Greece's Syriza or Spain's Podemos offer a pain-free path?
The question reflects a lamentable tendency to conflate two very different situations.
In the US, the issue was whether a government that could borrow at record-low interest rates, in the middle of a recession, should do so.
By contrast, Greece piled up an enormous fiscal and external debt in boom times, until markets said “enough" in 2009.
Greece was then given unprecedented amounts of highly subsidized finance to enable it to reduce gradually its excessive spending.
But now, after so much European and global generosity, Stiglitz and other economists argue that some of Greece's debt must be forgiven to make room for more spending.
But the truth is that the recession in Greece has little to do with an excessive debt burden.
Until 2014, the country did not pay, in net terms, a single euro in interest: it borrowed enough from official sources at subsidized rates to pay 100% of its interest bill and then some.
This situation supposedly changed a bit in 2014, the first year that the country made a small contribution to its interest bill, having run a primary surplus of barely 0.8% of GDP (or 0.5% of its debt of 170% of GDP).
Greece's experience highlights a truth about macroeconomic policy that is too often overlooked: The world is not dominated by austerians; on the contrary, most countries have trouble balancing their books.
Recent advances in behavioral economics show that we all have enormous problems with self-control.
And game theory explains why we act even more irresponsibly when making group decisions (owing to the so-called common pool problem).
Fiscal deficits, like unwanted pregnancies, are the unintended consequence of actions taken by more than one person who had other objectives in mind.
And lack of fiscal control is what got Greece into trouble in the first place.
So the problem is not that austerity was tried and failed in Greece.
It is that, despite unprecedented international generosity, fiscal policy was completely out of control and needed major adjustments.
Insufficient spending was never an issue.
From 1998 to 2007, Greece's annual per capita GDP growth averaged 3.8%, the second fastest in Western Europe, behind only Ireland.
But by 2007, Greece was spending more than 14% of GDP in excess of what it was producing, the largest such gap in Europe – more than twice that of Spain and 55% higher than Ireland's.
In Spain and Ireland, though, the gap reflected a construction boom; euro accession suddenly gave people access to much cheaper mortgages.
In Greece, by contrast, the gap was mostly fiscal and used for consumption, not investment.
Unsustainable growth paths often end in a sudden stop of capital inflows, forcing countries to bring their spending back in line with production.
In Greece, however, official lenders' unprecedented munificence made the adjustment more gradual than in, say, Latvia or Ireland.
In fact, even after the so-called Greek Depression, its economy has grown more in per capita terms since 1998 than Cyprus, Denmark, Italy, and Portugal.
Sudden stops are always painful: economics has not discovered a hangover cure.
But the way to minimize the pain is to cut spending without cutting output, which requires selling to others what residents can no longer afford.
In other words, unless Greece boosts exports, spending cuts will amplify the output loss in the same way that Keynesian multipliers amplified the output gain from borrowing.
The problem is that Greece produces very little of what the world wants to consume.
Its exports of goods comprise mainly fruits, olive oil, raw cotton, tobacco, and some refined petroleum products.
Germany, which many argue should spend more, imports just 0.2% of its goods from Greece.
Tourism is a mature industry with plenty of regional competitors.
The country produces no machines, electronics, or chemicals.
Of every $10 of world trade in information technology, Greece accounts for $0.01.
Greece never had the productive structure to be as rich as it was: its income was inflated by massive amounts of borrowed money that was not used to upgrade its productive capacity.
According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, which I co-authored, in 2008 the gap between Greece's income and the knowledge content of its exports was the largest among a sample of 128 countries.
Too much of the debate since then has focused on what Germany, the EU, or the International Monetary Fund must do.
But the bottom line is that Greece needs to develop its productive capabilities if it wants to grow.
The unfocused set of structural reforms prescribed by its current financing agreement will not do that.
Instead, Greece should concentrate on activist policies that attract globally competitive firms, an area where Ireland has much to teach – and where Stiglitz has sensible things to say.
Unfortunately, this is not what many Greeks (or Spaniards) believe.
A large plurality of them voted for Syriza, which wants to reallocate resources to wage increases and subsidies and does not even mention exports in its growth strategy.
They would be wise to remember that having Stiglitz as a cheerleader and Podemos as advisers did not save Venezuela from its current hyper-inflationary catastrophe.
Greece is Playing to Lose
LONDON – The future of Europe now depends on something apparently impossible: Greece and Germany must strike a deal.
What makes such a deal seem impossible is not the principled opposition of the two governments – Greece has demanded a debt reduction, while Germany has insisted that not a euro of debt can be written off – but something more fundamental: while Greece is obviously the weaker party in this conflict, it has far more at stake.
Game theory suggests that some of the most unpredictable conflicts are between a weak, but determined, combatant and a strong opponent with much less commitment.
In these scenarios, the most stable outcome tends to be a draw in which both sides are partly satisfied.
In the Greek-German confrontation, it is easy, at least in theory, to design such a positive-sum game.
All we must do is ignore political rhetoric and focus on the economic outcomes that the protagonists really want.
Germany is determined to resist any debt write-offs.
For German voters, this objective matters much more than the details of Greek structural reforms.
Greece, for its part, is determined to gain relief from the punitive and counter-productive austerity imposed on it, at Germany’s insistence, by the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund).
For Greek voters, this objective matters much more than detailed calculations about the net present value of national debt in 30 years.
A deal should be easily negotiable if both sides concentrate on their top priorities, while compromising on their secondary aims.
Unfortunately, human fallibility seems to be working against such a rational solution.
Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s new finance minister, is a professor of mathematical economics who specializes in game theory.
But his negotiating technique – unpredictable oscillations between aggressiveness and weakness – is the opposite of what game theory would dictate.
Varoufakis’s idea of strategy is to hold a gun to his own head, then demand a ransom for not pulling the trigger.
German and European Union policymakers are calling his bluff.
As a result, the two sides have become stuck in a passive-aggressive standoff that has made serious negotiation impossible.
There was nothing inevitable about this outcome.
Just last month, ECB President Mario Draghi provided a textbook example of how these negotiations could, and should, have progressed, when he outmaneuvered German opposition to the monetary stimulus that Europe clearly needed.
Draghi spent months before the ECB’s January 22 announcement that it would launch quantitative easing (QE) in intense public debate with the Germans over which point of principle they chose as a “red line” – the point beyond which no deal would be possible.
Germany’s red line was debt mutualization: there must be no sharing of losses if any eurozone country should default.
Draghi let Germany win on this issue, which he viewed as economically irrelevant.
But, crucially, he was careful not to back down until the last possible moment.
By focusing the QE debate on risk-sharing, Draghi managed to distract Germany from an infinitely more important issue: the enormous size of the QE program, which completely defied the German taboo against monetary financing of government debts.
By conceding at the right time on an issue of no importance, Draghi achieved an enormous breakthrough that really mattered to the ECB.
Had Varoufakis adopted an equivalent strategy for Greece, he would have stuck doggedly to his demand for debt cancellation until the last moment, then backed down on this “principle” in exchange for major concessions on austerity and structural reforms.
Or he could have adopted a less aggressive strategy: Concede from the start the German principle that debts are sacrosanct and then show that austerity could be eased without any reduction in the face value of Greek debt.
But, instead of consistently pursuing either strategy, Varoufakis veered between defiance and conciliation, losing credibility both ways.
Greece started the negotiation by insisting on debt reduction as its red line.
But, instead of sticking to this position and turning a debate over debt forgiveness into a Draghi-style diversionary tactic, Greece abandoned this demand within days.
Then came the pointless provocation of refusing talks with the troika, despite the fact that the three institutions are all much more sympathetic to Greek demands than the German government.
Finally, Varoufakis rejected any extension of the troika program.
This created an unnecessary new deadline of February 28 for the withdrawal of ECB funding and consequent collapse of the Greek banking system.
Greece’s idealistic new leaders seem to believe that they can overpower bureaucratic opposition without the usual compromises and obfuscations, simply by brandishing their democratic mandate.
But the primacy of bureaucracy over democracy is a core principle that EU institutions will never compromise.
The upshot is that Greece is back where it started in the poker contest with Germany and Europe.
The new government has shown its best cards too early and has no credibility left if it wants to try bluffing.
So what will happen next?
The most likely outcome is that Syriza will soon admit defeat, like every other eurozone government supposedly elected on a reform mandate, and revert to a troika-style program, sweetened only by dropping the name “troika.”
Another possibility, while Greek banks are still open for business, might be for the government to unilaterally implement some of its radical plans on wages and public spending, defying protests from Brussels, Frankfurt, and Berlin.
If Greece tries such unilateral defiance, the ECB will almost certainly vote to stop its emergency funding to the Greek banking system after the troika program expires on February 28.
As this self-inflicted deadline approaches, the Greek government will probably back down, just as Ireland and Cyprus capitulated when faced with similar threats.
Such last-minute capitulation could mean resignation for the new Greek government and its replacement by EU-approved technocrats, as in the constitutional putsch against Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi in 2012.
In a less extreme scenario, Varoufakis might be replaced as finance minister, while the rest of the government survives.
The only other possibility, if and when Greek banks start collapsing, would be an exit from the euro.
Whatever form the surrender takes, Greece will not be the only loser.
Proponents of democracy and economic expansion have missed their best chance to outmaneuver Germany and end the self-destructive austerity that Germany has imposed on Europe.
Greece’s Other Deficit
OAKLAND – For the past decade, much attention has been paid to Greece’s public finances.
And when, in November, the country faced the first review of its reform progress under its latest agreement with its creditors – an exercise required to obtain a new infusion of bailout funds – its budget deficit was put under the microscope once again.
But Greeks would do well to consider another type of deficit – one that has received far less public scrutiny, but could have economic consequences that are just as serious.
Like the rest of the Mediterranean region (and indeed the entire world), Greece is not just running a fiscal deficit; it is also running an ecological one.
According to our analysis, Mediterranean countries currently use 2.5 times more ecological resources and services than their ecosystems can renew.
Greece, for example, would need the total ecological resources and services of three Greeces in order to meet its citizens’ demand on nature for food, fiber, timber, housing, urban infrastructure, and carbon sequestration.
Athens alone demands 22% more from nature than the entire country’s ecosystems can provide.
And, after years of recession during which pressure on Greece’s natural resources declined, demand has begun to rise again, as GDP growth has shown some improvement.
To enable lasting economic progress, we need to break this link between GDP growth and overuse of the environment.
Ecological deficits can jeopardize energy sources and threaten food security, with direct social and economic consequences.
If Greece and other countries are to ensure the health and prosperity of their citizens in the decades to come, they will have to find a way to prevent current economic activity from increasing an already unsustainable burden of environmental debt.
For that to happen, ecological resources must come to be viewed as valuable endowments to be managed wisely.
The Mediterranean region’s unique, breathtaking natural capital is one of its greatest assets – the reason why more than 200 million tourists flock to the region each year, feeding the region’s economy.
Overusing resources, or even failing to manage them carefully, inevitably saps the region’s economic strength.
Of course, countries with ecological deficits can often fill part of the gap through global trade – if they can pay for the necessary imports.
But, as Greece has recently learned, countries dependent on external natural resources can experience economic shocks when commodity prices increase or their ability to pay otherwise declines.
According to our calculations, a mere 10% increase in commodity prices would result in a $7.6 billion hit to Greece’s trade balance – equivalent to 0.3% of its GDP.
In any case, reliance on global trade is not an adequate solution to the problem.
Some ecosystem services – including clean air and water, mitigation of extreme climate events such as floods or droughts, and recreational uses of nature – simply cannot be imported.
More important, if a country is importing natural resources, another country must be exporting them.
And just as governments cannot run huge financial deficits indefinitely, countries cannot continue to run large annual ecological imbalances without depleting their natural capital – and thus weakening their economic health.
Fortunately, countries like Greece are not powerless to act.
Cities offer particularly promising opportunities for improvement, especially in areas like transportation and housing.
Athens, for example, is an obvious target for policy changes.
The average ecological footprint of an Athenian is higher than the national average (and higher than the average footprint of residents in other Mediterranean cities such as Barcelona, Izmir, Palermo, and Valencia).
Transportation is the biggest source of this disparity, which means that policy interventions favoring public transport or walkability can reduce Athens’ ecological deficit.
Another area in which Greece should consider taking action is food.
The world-famous Mediterranean diet – heavy in vegetables, fruits, and olive oil – is not only healthy; it is less taxing on the environment.
As consumption of meat and processed foods rises around the Mediterranean, a renewed focus on the region’s culinary heritage could help lighten the load on the world’s natural resources – and boost people’s health.
As Greece’s government works to revive an economy flattened by fiscal disaster and improve the wellbeing of all, the path it forges toward long-term prosperity must not lead to further environmental degradation.
Greece cannot afford to address one of its deficits at the expense of the other.
Austerity Is the Only Deal-Breaker
ATHENS – A common fallacy pervades coverage by the world’s media of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors.
The fallacy, exemplified in a recent commentary by Philip Stephens of the Financial Times, is that, “Athens is unable or unwilling – or both – to implement an economic reform program.”
Once this fallacy is presented as fact, it is only natural that coverage highlights how our government is, in Stephens’s words, “squandering the trust and goodwill of its eurozone partners.”
But the reality of the talks is very different.
Our government is keen to implement an agenda that includes all of the economic reforms emphasized by European economic think tanks.
Moreover, we are uniquely able to maintain the Greek public’s support for a sound economic program.
Consider what that means: an independent tax agency; reasonable primary fiscal surpluses forever; a sensible and ambitious privatization program, combined with a development agency that harnesses public assets to create investment flows; genuine pension reform that ensures the social-security system’s long-term sustainability; liberalization of markets for goods and services, etc.
So, if our government is willing to embrace the reforms that our partners expect, why have the negotiations not produced an agreement?
Where is the sticking point?
The problem is simple: Greece’s creditors insist on even greater austerity for this year and beyond – an approach that would impede recovery, obstruct growth, worsen the debt-deflationary cycle, and, in the end, erode Greeks’ willingness and ability to see through the reform agenda that the country so desperately needs.
Our government cannot – and will not – accept a cure that has proven itself over five long years to be worse than the disease.
Our creditors’ insistence on greater austerity is subtle yet steadfast.
It can be found in their demand that Greece maintain unsustainably high primary surpluses (more than 2% of GDP in 2016 and exceeding 2.5%, or even 3%, for every year thereafter).
To achieve this, we are supposed to increase the overall burden of value-added tax on the private sector, cut already diminished pensions across the board; and compensate for low privatization proceeds (owing to depressed asset prices) with “equivalent” fiscal consolidation measures.
The view that Greece has not achieved sufficient fiscal consolidation is not just false; it is patently absurd.
The accompanying graph not only illustrates this; it also succinctly addresses the question of why Greece has not done as well as, say, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, or Cyprus in the years since the 2008 financial crisis.
Relative to the rest of the countries on the eurozone periphery, Greece was subjected to at least twice the austerity.
There is nothing more to it than that.
Following Prime Minister David Cameron’s recent election victory in the United Kingdom, my good friend Lord Norman Lamont, a former chancellor of the exchequer, remarked that the UK economy’s recovery supports our government’s position.
Back in 2010, he recalled, Greece and the UK faced fiscal deficits of more or less similar size (relative to GDP).
Greece returned to primary surpluses (which exclude interest payments) in 2014, whereas the UK government consolidated much more gradually and has yet to return to surplus.
At the same time, Greece has faced monetary contraction (which has recently become monetary asphyxiation), in contrast to the UK, where the Bank of England has supported the government every step of the way.
The result is that Greece is continuing to stagnate, whereas the UK has been growing strongly.
Fair-minded observers of the four-month-long negotiations between Greece and its creditors cannot avoid a simple conclusion: The major sticking point, the only deal-breaker, is the creditors’ insistence on even more austerity, even at the expense of the reform agenda that our government is eager to pursue.
Clearly, our creditors’ demand for more austerity has nothing to do with concerns about genuine reform or moving Greece onto a sustainable fiscal path.
Their true motivation is a question best left to future historians – who, I have no doubt, will take much of the contemporary media coverage with a grain of salt.
Greece Must Exit
NEW YORK – The Greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act: it is clear that either this year or next, Greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone.
Postponing the exit after the June election with a new government committed to a variant of the same failed policies (recessionary austerity and structural reforms) will not restore growth and competitiveness.
Greece is stuck in a vicious cycle of insolvency, lost competitiveness, external deficits, and ever-deepening depression.
The only way to stop it is to begin an orderly default and exit, coordinated and financed by the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund (the “Troika”), that minimizes collateral damage to Greece and the rest of the eurozone.
Greece’s recent financing package, overseen by the Troika, gave the country much less debt relief than it needed.
But, even with significantly more public-debt relief, Greece could not return to growth without rapidly restoring competitiveness.
And, without a return to growth, its debt burden will remain unsustainable.
But all of the options that might restore competitiveness require real currency depreciation.
The first option, a sharp weakening of the euro, is unlikely, as Germany is strong and the ECB is not aggressively easing monetary policy.
A rapid reduction in unit labor costs, through structural reforms that increased productivity growth in excess of wages, is just as unlikely.
It took Germany ten years to restore its competitiveness this way; Greece cannot remain in a depression for a decade.
Likewise, a rapid deflation in prices and wages, known as an “internal devaluation,” would lead to five years of ever-deepening depression.
If none of those three options is feasible, the only path left is to leave the eurozone.
A return to a national currency and a sharp depreciation would quickly restore competitiveness and growth.
Of course, the process would be traumatic – and not just for Greece.
The most significant problem would be capital losses for core eurozone financial institutions.
Overnight, the foreign euro liabilities of Greece’s government, banks, and companies would surge.
Yet these problems can be overcome.
Argentina did so in 2001, when it “pesofied” its dollar debts.
The United States did something similar in 1933, when it depreciated the dollar by 69% and abandoned the gold standard.
A similar “drachmatization” of euro debts would be necessary and unavoidable.
Losses that eurozone banks would suffer would be manageable if the banks were properly and aggressively recapitalized.
Avoiding a post-exit implosion of the Greek banking system, however, might require temporary measures, such as bank holidays and capital controls, to prevent a disorderly run on deposits.
The European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) should carry out the necessary recapitalization of the Greek banks via direct capital injections.
European taxpayers would effectively take over the Greek banking system, but this would be partial compensation for the losses imposed on creditors by drachmatization.
Greece would also have to restructure and reduce its public debt again.
The Troika’s claims on Greece need not be reduced in face value, but their maturity would have to be lengthened by another decade, and the interest on it reduced.
Further haircuts on private claims would also be needed, starting with a moratorium on interest payments.
Some argue that Greece’s real GDP would be much lower in an exit scenario than it would be during the hard slog of deflation.
But that is logically flawed: even with deflation, real purchasing power would fall, and the real value of debts would rise (debt deflation), as the real depreciation occurs.
More importantly, the exit path would restore growth right away, via nominal and real depreciation, avoiding a decade-long depression.
And trade losses imposed on the eurozone by the drachma depreciation would be modest, given that Greece accounts for only 2% of eurozone GDP.
Reintroducing the drachma risks exchange-rate depreciation in excess of what is necessary to restore competitiveness, which would be inflationary and impose greater losses on drachmatized external debts.
To minimize that risk, the Troika reserves currently devoted to the Greek bailout should be used to limit exchange-rate overshooting; capital controls would help, too.
Those who claim that contagion from a Greek exit would drag others into the crisis are also in denial.
Other peripheral countries already have Greek-style problems of debt sustainability and eroded competitiveness.
Portugal, for example, may eventually have to restructure its debt and exit the euro.
Illiquid but potentially solvent economies, such as Italy and Spain, will need support from Europe regardless of whether Greece exits; indeed, without such liquidity support, a self-fulfilling run on Italian and Spanish public debt is likely.
The substantial new official resources of the IMF and ESM – and ECB liquidity – could then be used to ring-fence these countries, and banks elsewhere in the eurozone’s troubled periphery.
Regardless of what Greece does, eurozone banks now need to be rapidly recapitalized, which requires a new EU-wide program of direct capital injections.
The experience of Iceland and many emerging markets over the past 20 years shows that nominal depreciation and orderly restructuring and reduction of foreign debts can restore debt sustainability, competitiveness, and growth.
As in these cases, the collateral damage to Greece of a euro exit will be significant, but it can be contained.
Like a doomed marriage, it is better to have rules for the inevitable divorce that make separation less costly to both sides.
Make no mistake: an orderly euro exit by Greece implies significant economic pain. But watching the slow, disorderly implosion of the Greek economy and society would be much worse.
Europe’s Vindictive Privatization Plan for Greece
ATHENS – On July 12, the summit of eurozone leaders dictated its terms of surrender to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who, terrified by the alternatives, accepted all of them.
One of those terms concerned the disposition of Greece’s remaining public assets.
Eurozone leaders demanded that Greek public assets be transferred to a Treuhand-like fund – a fire-sale vehicle similar to the one used after the fall of the Berlin Wall to privatize quickly, at great financial loss, and with devastating effects on employment all of the vanishing East German state’s public property.
This Greek Treuhand would be based in – wait for it – Luxembourg, and would be run by an outfit overseen by Germany���s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, the author of the scheme.
It would complete the fire sales within three years.
But, whereas the work of the original Treuhand was accompanied by massive West German investment in infrastructure and large-scale social transfers to the East German population, the people of Greece would receive no corresponding benefit of any sort.
Euclid Tsakalotos, who succeeded me as Greece’s finance minister two weeks ago, did his best to ameliorate the worst aspects of the Greek Treuhand plan.
He managed to have the fund domiciled in Athens, and he extracted from Greece’s creditors (the so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) the important concession that the sales could extend to 30 years, rather than a mere three.
This was crucial, for it will permit the Greek state to hold undervalued assets until their price recovers from the current recession-induced lows.
Alas, the Greek Treuhand remains an abomination, and it should be a stigma on Europe’s conscience.
Worse, it is a wasted opportunity.
The plan is politically toxic, because the fund, though domiciled in Greece, will effectively be managed by the troika.
It is also financially noxious, because the proceeds will go toward servicing what even the IMF now admits is an unpayable debt.
And it fails economically, because it wastes a wonderful opportunity to create homegrown investments to help counter the recessionary impact of the punitive fiscal consolidation that is also part of the July 12 summit’s “terms.”
It did not have to be this way.
On June 19, I communicated to the German government and to the troika an alternative proposal, as part of a document entitled “Ending the Greek Crisis”:
“The Greek government proposes to bundle public assets (excluding those pertinent to the country’s security, public amenities, and cultural heritage) into a central holding company to be separated from the government administration and to be managed as a private entity, under the aegis of the Greek Parliament, with the goal of maximizing the value of its underlying assets and creating a homegrown investment stream.
The Greek state will be the sole shareholder, but will not guarantee its liabilities or debt.”
The holding company would play an active role readying the assets for sale.
It would “issue a fully collateralized bond on the international capital markets” to raise €30-40 billion ($32-43 billion), which, “taking into account the present value of assets,” would “be invested in modernizing and restructuring the assets under its management.”
The plan envisaged an investment program of 3-4 years, resulting in “additional spending of 5% of GDP per annum,” with current macroeconomic conditions implying “a positive growth multiplier above 1.5,” which “should boost nominal GDP growth to a level above 5% for several years.”
This, in turn, would induce “proportional increases in tax revenues,” thereby “contributing to fiscal sustainability, while enabling the Greek government to exercise spending discipline without further shrinking the social economy.”
In this scenario, the primary surplus (which excludes interest payments) would “achieve ‘escape velocity’ magnitudes in absolute as well as percentage terms over time.”
As a result, the holding company would “be granted a banking license” within a year or two, “thus turning itself into a full-fledged Development Bank capable of crowding in private investment to Greece and of entering into collaborative projects with the European Investment Bank.”
The Development Bank that we proposed would “allow the government to choose which assets are to be privatized and which not, while guaranteeing a greater impact on debt reduction from the selected privatizations.”
After all, “asset values should increase by more than the actual amount spent on modernization and restructuring, aided by a program of public-private partnerships whose value is boosted according to the probability of future privatization.”
Our proposal was greeted with deafening silence.
More precisely, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers and the troika continued to leak to the global media that the Greek authorities had no credible, innovative proposals on offer – their standard refrain.
A few days later, once the powers-that-be realized that the Greek government was about to capitulate fully to the troika’s demands, they saw fit to impose upon Greece their demeaning, unimaginative, and pernicious Treuhand model.
At a turning point in European history, our innovative alternative was thrown into the dustbin.
It remains there for others to retrieve.
Greece-Proofing China
BEIJING – Despite repeated assurances by European Union leaders, after more than two years, there is still no light at the end of Europe’s debt-crisis tunnel.
Recently, the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, referring to a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, told the European Parliament that there is no “Plan B.”
Barroso’s statement was meant to be reassuring.
But, after so many disappointments, China cannot accept at face value the assurances of European politicians, which even they themselves do not know whether they can redeem.
China should have its own Plan B in case Greece has to leave the eurozone.
Indeed, it is increasingly likely that Greece will renege on its bailout obligations.
If that happens and the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) cuts off financial support, Greece’s exit from the euro will become all but inevitable.
In that event, China must be prepared for any ensuing global financial turmoil and longer-term consequences.
For starters, Chinese officials should be under no illusion that the country will be immune to financial contagion.
A “Grexit” would hit European banks that hold peripheral eurozone countries’ sovereign bonds.
Shock waves from the deleveraging would, in turn, spread to emerging markets like China.
Although the exposure of Chinese banks and financial institutions to eurozone sovereign and banking-sector assets is negligible, post-Grexit capital flight from risky markets could rival, or even surpass, that in the weeks following Lehman Brothers’ collapse in September 2008.
Compared to 2007 and 2008, foreign investors’ holdings in emerging markets are much higher, owing to these countries’ relative economic strength in recent years and rock-bottom returns on developed-market financial assets.
In fact, China already experienced the impact of deleveraging late last year, when the European financial system seemed on the brink of collapse.
With European banks hunkering down, the renminbi’s exchange rate fell for 11 consecutive days, even though China was running a current-account surplus.
The performance of emerging-market currencies and other assets so far in the second quarter suggests that deleveraging has begun once again.
Disappointing first-quarter growth data have already led foreign investors to have second thoughts about keeping money in China.
A Grexit could prove to be the last straw, and would surely lead to a tightening in domestic monetary conditions at a very precarious point in the economic cycle.
As such, the timing could not be worse to float the idea of speeding up capital-account liberalization.
On the contrary, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) and other relevant authorities should consider capital controls, market suspensions, and emergency liquidity provision.
These measures are not dissimilar to those that the eurozone will pursue if Greece exits.
Ideally, the response would be coordinated with China’s international partners in the G-20.
The infrastructure for such cooperation has developed strongly since 2008, and China must not shy away from advocating its deployment.
Moreover, China must have a medium-term plan to deal with the economic aftermath of a Grexit.
Should contagion prove to be limited, with Greece the only casualty, the drop in eurozone output may be severe, but not catastrophic.
Nonetheless, the EU is China’s most important trading partner, and China must be braced for serious job losses in the export sector.
Japan’s experience shows that a recession that results from a financial crisis can be extremely prolonged, because deleveraging is a long process.
It is highly likely that today’s recession will drag on for many more years in both America and the EU.
So China’s government must have a medium- and long-term plan to address problems caused by a drawn-out global slump.
The problems include a surge in unemployment, and the need to reallocate fiscal resources to these individuals, whose welfare is critical to the preservation of social stability.
More importantly, the Chinese government should not retreat from efforts to implement structural reforms aimed at shifting China’s growth model to one that places much greater emphasis on domestic demand.
In addition, net foreign capital inflows are likely to dwindle for several quarters at least, affecting domestic monetary conditions while aggregate demand is weak.
As such, the PBoC will need to maintain counter-cyclical policies in order to avoid a deflationary spiral.
Although bound to be controversial, especially in an election year in the United States, enough flexibility should be given to the renminbi in both directions when it is needed.
One of the biggest failures of the eurozone periphery is a loss in competitiveness, hidden by a wall of credit that has been leveraged from Germany’s balance sheet.
This is always unsustainable.
Any loosening by the PBoC should not be used to avoid painful structural reforms.
Finally, China should be ready to extend a helping hand.
To ensure that the post-Grexit eurozone’s integrity faces no further immediate threats, China must join international partners in establishing a fully credible firewall, via the IMF.
However, the eurozone, and Germany in particular, must fully acknowledge the fundamental causes of Greece’s exit and pledge to move towards fiscal union, while acknowledging that an austerity-only approach towards other at-risk members is a dead end.
An adequate firewall and a European commitment to structural reform would go far toward calming markets and reducing the risks to any Chinese contribution.
In other words, any assistance that China provides must be “throwing good money after good potential results.”
Of course, IMF governance reform will also need to be part of the discussion.
Meanwhile, the eurozone will likely be more open to foreign investment out of necessity, and cash-rich Chinese companies should continue to pursue opportunities via FDI or corporate acquisitions.
A potential Grexit will present entirely new challenges to China in the coming months, and the country must avoid complacency over its own exposure. A battle plan for both the present and the future is needed now.
Greece’s Vote for Sovereignty
CAMBRIDGE – Creditors and debtors have found themselves at odds for as long as money has changed hands.
But rarely have the issues been framed as starkly – and in such a public manner – as in the just completed Greek referendum.
In a vote on July 5, the Greek electorate resoundingly rejected demands for further austerity by the country’s foreign creditors: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the other eurozone governments, led by Germany.
Whatever the economic merits of the decision, the Greek people’s voice rang loud and clear: We are not going to take it anymore.
It would be a mistake, however, to view the vote in Greece as a straightforward victory for democracy – despite what the country’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his supporters like to claim.
What the Greeks call democracy comes across in many other – equally democratic – countries as irresponsible unilateralism.
There is, in fact, little sympathy for the Greek position in other eurozone countries, where similar referendums would undoubtedly show overwhelming public support for the continuation of the austerity policies imposed on Greece.
And it isn’t just citizens of the large creditor countries, such as Germany, who have little patience for Greece.
Exasperation is especially widespread among the eurozone’s poorer members.
Ask the average person on the street in Slovakia, Estonia, or Lithuania, and you are likely to get a response not too different from this one from a Latvian pensioner: “We learned our lesson – why can’t the Greeks learn the same lesson?”
One might argue that Europeans are not well informed about the plight of the Greeks and the damage that austerity has done to the country.
And, indeed, it is possible that with better information, many among them would change their position.
But the forces of public opinion on which democracies rest rarely take shape in ideal conditions.
Indeed, one need look no further than the Greek vote itself to find an example of raw emotions and outrage winning out over a rational calculation of economic costs and benefits.
It is important to remember that the creditors in this instance are not a bunch of oligarchs or wealthy private bankers, but the governments of the other eurozone countries, democratically accountable to their own electorates.
(Whether they did the right thing in 2012 by lending to Greece so that their own bankers could be repaid is a legitimate, but separate question.)
This is not a conflict between the Greek demos – its people – and the bankers, as much as it is a conflict between European democracies.
When the Greeks voted “no,” they reaffirmed their democracy; but, more than that, they asserted the priority of their democracy over those in other eurozone countries.
In other words, they asserted their national sovereignty – their right as a nation to determine their own economic, social, and political path.
If the Greek referendum is a victory for anything, it is a victory for national sovereignty.
That is what makes it so ominous for Europe.
The European Union, and even more so the eurozone, was constructed on the expectation that the exercise of national sovereignty would fade away over time.
This was rarely made explicit; sovereignty, after all, is popular.
But as economic unification narrowed each country’s room for maneuver, it was hoped, national action would be exercised less frequently.
The Greek referendum has put perhaps the final nail in the coffin of that idea.
It need not have been this way.
Europe’s political elite could have framed the Greek financial crisis as a tale of economic interdependence – you cannot have bad borrowers, after all, without careless lenders – instead of a morality tale pitting frugal, hard-working Germans against profligate, carefree Greeks.
Doing so might have facilitated the sharing of the burden between debtors and creditors and prevented the emergence of the us-versus-them attitude that poisoned the relationship between Greece and the institutions of the eurozone.
More fundamentally, economic integration could have been accompanied by the expansion of a European political space.
Compensating for reduced national autonomy by creating room for democratic action at the European level really would have been a victory for democracy.
It is too late to debate whether the culprit was the unwillingness of the European public to embark on the path toward political union or the timidity of its national politicians to exercise leadership.
The consequence is that in today’s Europe, democracy can be reaffirmed only by asserting national sovereignty.
And that is what the Greek electorate has done.
The referendum is deeply important, but mostly as an act of political symbolism.
What remains to be seen is whether the Greek public also has the stomach for the economic actions – in particular, an exit from the eurozone and the introduction of a national currency – that real sovereignty would entail.
After all, the terms on offer from the country’s creditors are unlikely to change much.
If the Greeks voted “no” based on unrealistic expectations that other eurozone democracies would be forced to bend to their wishes, they may be in for another deep disappointment – and their own lesson in democracy.
Europe’s Attack on Greek Democracy
NEW YORK – The rising crescendo of bickering and acrimony within Europe might seem to outsiders to be the inevitable result of the bitter endgame playing out between Greece and its creditors.
In fact, European leaders are finally beginning to reveal the true nature of the ongoing debt dispute, and the answer is not pleasant: it is about power and democracy much more than money and economics.
Of course, the economics behind the program that the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) foisted on Greece five years ago has been abysmal, resulting in a 25% decline in the country’s GDP.
I can think of no depression, ever, that has been so deliberate and had such catastrophic consequences: Greece’s rate of youth unemployment, for example, now exceeds 60%.
It is startling that the troika has refused to accept responsibility for any of this or admit how bad its forecasts and models have been.
But what is even more surprising is that Europe’s leaders have not even learned.
The troika is still demanding that Greece achieve a primary budget surplus (excluding interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP by 2018.
Economists around the world have condemned that target as punitive, because aiming for it will inevitably result in a deeper downturn.
Indeed, even if Greece’s debt is restructured beyond anything imaginable, the country will remain in depression if voters there commit to the troika’s target in the snap referendum to be held this weekend.
In terms of transforming a large primary deficit into a surplus, few countries have accomplished anything like what the Greeks have achieved in the last five years.
And, though the cost in terms of human suffering has been extremely high, the Greek government’s recent proposals went a long way toward meeting its creditors’ demands.
We should be clear: almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to Greece has actually gone there.
It has gone to pay out private-sector creditors – including German and French banks.
Greece has gotten but a pittance, but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries’ banking systems.
The IMF and the other “official” creditors do not need the money that is being demanded.
Under a business-as-usual scenario, the money received would most likely just be lent out again to Greece.
But, again, it’s not about the money.
It’s about using “deadlines” to force Greece to knuckle under, and to accept the unacceptable – not only austerity measures, but other regressive and punitive policies.
But why would Europe do this?
Why are European Union leaders resisting the referendum and refusing even to extend by a few days the June 30 deadline for Greece’s next payment to the IMF?
Isn’t Europe all about democracy?
In January, Greece’s citizens voted for a government committed to ending austerity.
If the government were simply fulfilling its campaign promises, it would already have rejected the proposal.
But it wanted to give Greeks a chance to weigh in on this issue, so critical for their country’s future wellbeing.
That concern for popular legitimacy is incompatible with the politics of the eurozone, which was never a very democratic project.
Most of its members’ governments did not seek their people’s approval to turn over their monetary sovereignty to the ECB.
When Sweden’s did, Swedes said no.
They understood that unemployment would rise if the country’s monetary policy were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation (and also that there would be insufficient attention to financial stability).
The economy would suffer, because the economic model underlying the eurozone was predicated on power relationships that disadvantaged workers.
And, sure enough, what we are seeing now, 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships, is the antithesis of democracy: Many European leaders want to see the end of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist government.
After all, it is extremely inconvenient to have in Greece a government that is so opposed to the types of policies that have done so much to increase inequality in so many advanced countries, and that is so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth.
They seem to believe that they can eventually bring down the Greek government by bullying it into accepting an agreement that contravenes its mandate.
It is hard to advise Greeks how to vote on July 5.
Neither alternative – approval or rejection of the troika’s terms – will be easy, and both carry huge risks.
A yes vote would mean depression almost without end.
Perhaps a depleted country – one that has sold off all of its assets, and whose bright young people have emigrated – might finally get debt forgiveness; perhaps, having shriveled into a middle-income economy, Greece might finally be able to get assistance from the World Bank.
All of this might happen in the next decade, or perhaps in the decade after that.
By contrast, a no vote would at least open the possibility that Greece, with its strong democratic tradition, might grasp its destiny in its own hands.
Greeks might gain the opportunity to shape a future that, though perhaps not as prosperous as the past, is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present.
I know how I would vote.
Greece’s “No” is No Victory for Democracy
PARIS – Despite what many are saying – especially those who do not have to bear the consequences of their words – Greek voters’ rejection on Sunday of the latest bailout offer from their country’s creditors did not represent a “victory for democracy.”
For democracy, as the Greeks know better than anyone, is a matter of mediation, representation, and orderly delegation of power. It is not ordinarily a matter of referendum.
Democracy becomes a matter of referendum only in exceptional circumstances: when elected leaders run out of ideas, when they have lost the confidence of their electorate, or when the usual approaches have ceased to work.
Was that the case in Greece?
Was the position of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras so weak that he had no better choice than to pass the buck to his people by resorting to the extraordinary form of democracy that is democracy by referendum?
What would happen if Greece’s partners, each time they confronted a decision that they lacked the courage to make, broke off discussions and demanded a week to allow the people to decide?
It is often said – and rightly so – that Europe is too bureaucratic, too unwieldy, too slow to make decisions.
The least that can be said is that Tsipras’s approach does not make up for these defects.
(Much more could be said, if it inspires Spanish citizens to take the risky decision of electing a government led by their own anti-austerity party, Podemos.)
Putting this aside, let us suppose that the decision before Tsipras was so crucial and complex that it merited the exceptional step of referendum.
In that case, the event should have reflected that complexity.
It should have been a careful and deliberate sounding out of the will of the people.
It should have been organized and carried out with due respect for the stakes involved, with the government ensuring that adequate information was relayed to the Greek people.
Instead, Greece got a hastily arranged referendum.
It got an opaque – indeed, a downright incomprehensible – referendum question.
It got no public-information campaign worthy of the name.
It got an appeal for a “No” vote that no one understood; the details of the proposals that Greek voters were supposed to reject were not even disclosed to them.
Ancient Greek had two words for the people: the “demos” of democracy and the “laos” of the mob.
With his puerile call to shift the burden of his own errors and his reluctance to reform onto the shoulders of Greece’s fellow Europeans, Tsipras is leaning toward the latter manifestation – and promoting the worst version of Greek politics.
Tsipras might defend his approach to the referendum by asserting that his goal was not so much to sound out the people as to reinforce his position in the confrontation with Greece’s creditors.
But what is the justification for that confrontation?
That they had the audacity to demand progress toward the rule of law and social justice, as well as efforts to tame Greece’s shipping magnates and its tax-avoiding clergy?
The European Union has achieved peace precisely by learning, gradually, to replace the old logic of confrontation and conflict with that of negotiation and compromise.
Despite its defects, the EU has become a laboratory of democratic innovation, in which, for the first time in centuries, an attempt is being made to settle differences not by political war and blackmail but by listening, dialogue, and a synthesis of different points of view.
In this sense, the Greek referendum delivered an insult to 18 countries, including some that are in situations no less difficult than Greece’s, and yet have made considerable sacrifices to grant the country, in 2012 alone, €105 billion ($116 billion) in debt relief while remaining accountable to their own populations.
What twist of the mind enables one to call that an “act of resistance” or the “defense of democracy?”
Yet many have.
Indeed, since the referendum, many have acted as if Tsipras were the last eurozone democrat, as if he had faced a “totalitarian” clique (as described by the far-right French politician Marine Le Pen) against which he valiantly “stood firm” (in the words of far-left politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon).
I will not dwell on Tsipras’s parliamentary alliance with the conspiracy-minded, right-wing Independent Greeks, whose leaders do not shy away from diatribes against homosexuals, Buddhists, Jews, and Muslims.
Nor will I dwell on the fact that Tsipras did not refrain, when assembling parliamentary support for his referendum, from soliciting the support of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, whose help any other European leader would have rejected.
Instead, I will emphasize the fact that Tsipras’s fellow European leaders are no less democratic or legitimate than he.
The countries of Central Europe that endured Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism do not need lessons in legitimacy from anyone – especially not the Greek prime minister.
The brave Baltic countries – the “legality” of whose independence is reportedly being reviewed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, another unsavory pal of Tsipras – have not yielded to panic or succumbed to the temptation to burden others with their misfortune.
They are not using their struggles as a pretext to default on their duty of solidarity with Greece.
None of this means that we should write off Greece’s EU membership.
In other times, the Greeks paid dearly for their “No” to Nazism and their “No” to military dictatorship.
Nothing would be sadder than to see them also have to pay for last Sunday’s “No” – a farcical simulation of those earlier noble acts of defiance.
May eurozone leaders have the forbearance to recognize the flawed “No” that has been delivered, and to be more Greek than the Greeks.
May they act in a way that prevents Greece from ever having to face the true, tragic meaning of Sunday’s vote.
Greece’s Catharsis?
ATHENS – Sunday’s election in Greece will decide whether confrontation or negotiation will be used to change the terms of Greece’s refinancing agreement with the eurozone.
Rather than helping Greece to overcome its crisis, the austerity policies pursued since May 2010 have plunged it into a deep recession that perpetuates fiscal deficits and aggravates financial uncertainty.
It is becoming increasingly clear that if Greece proceeds to unilateral action – whether by repealing unpopular austerity laws or renouncing the loan agreement itself – the eurozone will suspend disbursement of the loan.
The government will find it impossible to fulfill basic obligations, such as paying salaries and pensions, and the country will formally default.
International banks will cease to finance Greek enterprises, including imports, creating shortages of fuel, food, and medicines.
As confidence that Greece will remain in the eurozone plummets, a run on deposits will cause the banking system – and, eventually, the real economy – to collapse.
The next step will be forced exit from the euro and reintroduction of the drachma, implying a dramatic drop in living standards, owing in part to immediate devaluation of the new currency and high inflation.
Meanwhile, the benefits in terms of competitiveness will be very limited, owing to the country’s narrow export base, and will evaporate in a vicious circle of devaluations and rising interest rates.
Long-term stagnation and high unemployment are the likely result of confrontation with the eurozone, which leaves only the path of renegotiation.
The new political balance emerging in Europe after the Socialists’ victory in France’s presidential election creates scope for changes in the terms of the loan agreement that would help to boost economic growth.
Opting for renegotiation assumes the victory of pro-euro political forces in Sunday’s elections.
New Democracy, Pasok, and Democratic Left belong to this group, as opposed to Syriza and some smaller parties on the extreme right and left, which support a confrontational stance vis-à-vis the eurozone, eventually leading to the euro exit.
If a pro-euro majority emerges on June 17, the new government’s main challenge will be to propose a new policy agenda, and then to negotiate a revised deal with the eurozone.
The key to growth is increased competitiveness through higher productivity and lower production costs.
In the 1990’s, in the run-up to joining the eurozone, Greece achieved substantial gains on this front.
With inflation falling sharply, real incomes increased.
Fiscal deficits were reduced.
Important structural reforms were implemented, particularly privatization.
Investment accelerated, and major infrastructure projects were realized.
High growth rates were achieved in conditions of stability.
Unfortunately, that effort ceased over the last decade.
Selfish interests prevailed.
Business groups attempted to capture specific markets.
Public-sector trade unions fought for preserving privileges.
Tax discipline was further weakened.
The welfare state was transformed into a system of endemic waste.
A gap emerged between the economy’s productive base, which remained stagnant, and Greeks’ expectations (and demands), which were rising fast.
The agreement with the eurozone attempted to close the gap in a clumsy and misguided way.
Instead of focusing on structural reforms to liberate the economy’s productive forces, it relied on income cuts and tax increases.
The incompetence of the governments that implemented the agreement exacerbates that defect by sidelining structural reforms and enacting only the terms concerning austerity.
The renegotiation should aim at changing the policy mix in the following directions:
Extending the timetable of fiscal-deficit reduction in order to limit the depth of the recession.Avoiding any new cut in incomes or new taxes, with reduction in indirect taxation to start immediately.Social-protection measures, particularly for the unemployed.A European Marshall Plan, through grants from the European Union’s structural funds and loans from the European Investment Bank, in order to sustain economic activity and create new jobs.Achieving these targets presupposes that Greece’s new government implements all of the structural changes agreed with the eurozone.
Privatization, opening up closed markets and professions, promoting entrepreneurship, and eliminating public-sector waste should proceed at a fast pace over the next few months.
The European Marshall Plan would offer a unique opportunity to reorient growth policies.
Greece should move beyond its traditional focus on sectors such as tourism, shipping, and construction, and search for new areas of comparative advantage in renewable energy, high-value-added services, and selected lines of manufacturing that benefit from the country’s research potential.
If Greece succeeds in fulfilling the requirements of a revised financing agreement with the eurozone, it may win the confidence bet by convincing financial markets that it is determined to achieve the targets.
Confidence will unlock the door to economic recovery.
The fear of a return to the drachma will recede.
Consumption levels will begin to recover.
Deposit outflows will cease.
The banking system will be reinforced.
Investors will reevaluate opportunities for undertaking new initiatives.
A virtuous circle may be set in motion, leading the country, eventually, to escape the crisis zone.
The outcome of Sunday’s election will determine which way Greece goes – and, also, of course, how the unfolding Greek drama affects the eurozone’s future.
The Mirage of Structural Reform
ATHENS – Every economic program imposed on Greece by its creditors since the financial crisis struck in 2009 has been held together by a central conceit: that structural reforms, conceived boldly and implemented without slippage, would bring about rapid economic recovery.
The European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund anticipated that fiscal austerity would be costly to incomes and employment – though they significantly underestimated just how costly.
But they argued that long-delayed (and much-needed) pro-market reforms would result in a compensatory boost to the Greek economy.
Any serious assessment of the actual results produced by structural reforms around the world – particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe since 1990 – would have poured cold water on such expectations.
Privatization, deregulation, and liberalization typically produce growth in the longer term at best, with short-run effects that are often negative.
It is not that governments cannot engineer quick growth takeoffs.
In fact, such growth accelerations are quite common around the world.
But they are associated with more targeted, selective removal of key obstacles, rather than broad liberalization and economy-wide reform efforts.
The theory behind structural reforms is simple: opening the economy to competition will increase the efficiency with which resources are allocated.
Open up regulated professions – pharmacies, notaries, and taxicabs, for example – and inefficient suppliers will be driven out by more productive firms.
Privatize state enterprises, and the new management will rationalize production (and shed all the excess workers who owe their jobs to political patronage).
These changes do not directly induce economic growth, but they increase the economy’s potential – or long-run – income.
Growth itself occurs as the economy begins to converge to this higher level of long-run income.
Many academic studies have found that the rate of convergence tends to be about 2% per year.
That is, each year, an economy tends to close 2% of the gap between its actual and potential income levels.
This estimate helps us gauge the magnitude of growth we can expect from structural reform.
Let’s be hyper-optimistic and suppose that structural reforms enable Greece to double its potential income over three years – pushing Greek per capita GDP significantly beyond the European Union average.
Applying convergence math, this would produce an annual growth boost of only about 1.3%, on average, over the next three years.
To place this number in perspective, remember that Greek GDP has shrunk by 25% since 2009.
So, if structural reforms have not paid off in Greece, it is not because Greek governments have slacked off.
Greece’s record on implementation is actually pretty good.
From 2010 to 2015, Greece climbed nearly 40 places in the World Banks’s business-environment rankings.
Instead, the current disappointment arises from the very logic of structural reform: most of the benefits come much later, not when a country really needs them.
There is an alternative strategy that could produce significantly more rapid growth.
A selective approach that targets the “binding constraints” – those areas where the growth returns are the greatest – would maximize early benefits.
It would also ensure that the Greek authorities spend valuable political and human capital on the battles that really matter.
So, which binding constraints in the Greek economy should be targeted?
The biggest bang for the reform buck would be obtained from increasing the profitability of tradables – spurring investment and entrepreneurship in export activities, both existing and new.
Of course, Greece lacks the most direct instrument for achieving this – currency depreciation – owing to its eurozone membership.
But other countries’ experience provides a rich inventory of alternative tools for export promotion – from tax incentives to special zones to targeted infrastructure projects.
Most urgently, Greece needs to create an institution close to the prime minister that is tasked with fostering a dialogue with potential investors.
The institution needs the authority to remove the obstacles it identifies, rather than having its proposals languish in various ministries.
Such obstacles are typically highly specific – a zoning regulation here, a training program there – and are unlikely to be well targeted by broad structural reforms.
The absence to date of a single-minded focus on tradables has been costly.
Different reforms have had conflicting effects on export competitiveness.
For example, in manufacturing, the competitiveness benefits of wage cuts (“internal devaluation”) were offset by the increases in energy costs resulting from fiscal austerity measures and price adjustments by state enterprises.
A more focused reform strategy could have protected exporting activities from such adverse effects.
Conventional structural reform tends to be biased toward “best practices” – policy remedies that are supposedly universally valid.
But, as successful countries around the world have discovered, a best-practice mindset does not help much in promoting new exports.
Lacking its own currency, the Greek government will have to be especially creative and imaginative.
In particular, the experience of other countries suggests that a quick supply response is likely to require selective, discretionary policies in favor of exporters, rather than the “horizontal” policies that advocates of conventional structural reform prefer.
Therein lies a paradox: The more orthodox Greece’s macro and fiscal strategy is, the more heterodox its growth strategy will have to be.
Still No Exit for Greece
WASHINGTON, DC – Opinion polls in the run-up to Greece’s early general election on January 25 indicate that the left-wing Syriza party is likely to win the largest share of votes.
As a result, Syriza stands to earn a crucial premium under Greek electoral law, according to which the party that gains the most votes is allocated an extra 50 of the parliament’s 300 seats.
In other words, Syriza could come to power, with enormous implications for Greece and Europe.
Syriza is more a coalition than a unified party, meaning that its leader, Alexis Tsipras, must reconcile moderate socialists, including some of his economic advisers, with radical left-wing members.
The implementation and impact of Syriza’s agenda, especially its decisive economic program, will depend on the new government’s ability to maintain support at home and compromise with Greece’s creditors abroad.
Syriza’s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported – or, some might say, imposed – by the so-called “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission).
These policies require Greece to maintain a very high primary budget surplus – more than 4% of GDP – for many years to come.
Syriza also plans to demand a substantial reduction in Greece’s foreign debt, the nominal value of which remains very high – close to 170% of GDP.
In fact, the real present value of the debt is much lower, given that most of it is now held by governments or other public entities and carries long maturities and low interest rates.
Nonetheless, repayment “spikes” this year constitute a real short-term challenge.
The problem for Greece is that its creditors may adopt a very tough stance.
This largely reflects the belief that, if a breakdown of negotiations triggers another Greek crisis, the systemic risks to the eurozone and the wider European Union would be far smaller than they were just a few years ago.
The “acute” phase of the euro crisis is over; even if growth remains elusive, financial contagion is no longer viewed as a risk.
After all, private creditors hold only a minimal share of Greek debt nowadays.
In 2010-2012, by contrast, systemically important European banks were exposed, raising the risk of a domino effect that threatened the entire eurozone.
Moreover, a debt reduction in the form of further interest-rate reductions and maturity extensions on foreign government-held debt would not hurt financial markets.
But debt held by the European Central Bank and the IMF could pose a problem.
If Greece’s new government does not tread lightly in these discussions, withdrawal of these institutions’ liquidity support for Greek banks could follow.
Despite the lack of significant financial contagion risk, a renewed Greek crisis, stemming from a lasting and serious breakdown of negotiations between the new government and EU institutions, would constitute a major problem for European cooperation.
The absence of financial contagion would not rule out serious political repercussions.
Europe’s political landscape is changing.
Populist parties, both on the far right and the far left, are gaining electoral traction.
Some, such as France’s National Front, oppose their country’s eurozone membership; others, such as Podemos in Spain, do not.
Nonetheless, the challenge that these new parties pose to Europe could prove to be extremely disruptive.
A Greek exit from the eurozone, together with financial and political turmoil inside Greece, would be perceived as a major defeat for European integration – especially after the laborious efforts made to hold together the monetary union and, with it, the European dream.
Such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris, and after unity marches in France and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of European solidarity.
A new image of solidarity is precisely what the Greek election should produce.
There is little doubt that the suffering that Greeks have had to endure for the last five years is mainly attributable to the fiscal profligacy and poor public management of a procession of Greek governments.
But as most analysts, including at the IMF, now agree, the troika’s approach was also deeply flawed, as it emphasized wage and income cuts, while neglecting the reform of product markets and the dismantling of harmful public and private oligopolies.
For the sake of Greece and Europe, the new government must work with the European institutions to revise their strategy, while taking responsibility for implementing growth-promoting structural reforms.
Greece’s creditors and partners, for their part, must provide the fiscal space needed for the reforms to work.
Walking away from Greece because it no longer poses a threat of financial contagion is not a politically viable option.
Both sides will have to show more foresight.
The last five years have provided two clear lessons for Europe: procrastination only makes reform more difficult, and the end of financial turmoil does not necessarily mean the end of socioeconomic crisis.
It is time to use these lessons to develop a cooperative strategy that will finally enable Greece to make real progress toward a more stable future.
A Greek exit from the euro is not a more viable solution today than it was three years ago.
Shelter from the Storm in Europe
LAGUNA BEACH – Dark clouds are lowering over Europe’s economic future, as three distinct tempests gather: the Greek crisis, Russia’s incursion in Ukraine, and the rise of populist political parties.
Though each poses a considerable threat, Europe, aided by the recent cyclical pickup, is in a position to address them individually, without risking more than a temporary set of disruptions.
Should they converge into a kind of “perfect storm,” however, a return to sunny days will become extremely difficult to foresee any time soon.
As it stands, the three storms are at different stages of formation.
The Greek crisis, having been building for years, is blowing the hardest.
Beyond the potential for the first eurozone exit, Greece could be at risk of becoming a failed state – an outcome that would pose a multi-dimensional threat to the rest of Europe.
Mitigating the adverse humanitarian consequences (associated with cross-border migration), and geopolitical impact of this storm would be no easy feat.
The second storm, rolling in from the EU’s east, is the costly military conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region.
The crisis in eastern Ukraine has been contained only partly by the Minsk II ceasefire agreement, and reflects the deepest rupture in the West’s relationship with Russia since the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Further Russian interference in Ukraine – directly and/or through separatist proxies in Donbas – would present the West with a stark choice.
It would either have to tighten sanctions on Russia, potentially tipping Western Europe into recession as Russia responds with counter-sanctions, or accommodate the Kremlin’s expansionist ambitions and jeopardize other countries with Russian-speaking minorities (including the EU’s Baltic members).
The third storm – political tumult brought about by the rise of populist political movements – poses yet another serious threat.
Energized by broad voter dissatisfaction, particularly in struggling economies, these political movements tend to focus on a small handful of issues, opposing, say, immigrants, austerity, or the European Union – essentially whomever they can scapegoat for their countries’ troubles.
Already, Greek voters handed the far-left anti-austerity Syriza party a sweeping victory in January.
France’s far-right National Front is currently second in opinion polls.
The anti-immigration Danish People’s Party finished second in the country’s just-concluded general election, with 22% of the vote.
And, in Spain, the leftist anti-austerity Podemos commands double-digit support.
These parties’ extremist tendencies and narrow platforms are limiting governments’ policy flexibility by driving relatively moderate parties and politicians to adopt more radical positions.
It was concern about the United Kingdom Independence Party’s capacity to erode the Conservatives’ political base that pushed Prime Minister David Cameron to commit to a referendum on the country’s continued EU membership.
With three storms looming, Europe’s leaders must act fast to ensure that they can dissipate each before it merges with the others, and cope effectively with whatever disruptions they cause.
The good news is that regional crisis-management tools have lately been strengthened considerably, especially since the summer of 2012, when the euro came very close to collapsing.
Indeed, not only are new institutional circuit breakers, such as the European Financial Stability Facility, in place; existing bodies have also been made more flexible and thus more effective.
Moreover, the European Central Bank is engaged in a large-scale asset-purchasing initiative that could be easily and rapidly expanded.
And countries like Ireland, Portugal, and Spain have, through hard and painful work, reduced their vulnerability to contagion from nearby crises.
But these buffers would be severely strained if the gathering storms converged into a single devastating gale.
Given the EU’s fundamental interconnectedness – in economic, financial, geopolitical, and social terms – the disruptive impact of each shock would amplify the others, overwhelming the region’s circuit breakers, leading to recession, reviving financial instability, and creating pockets of social tension.
This would increase already-high unemployment, expose excessive financial risk-taking, embolden Russia, and strengthen populist movements further, thereby impeding comprehensive policy responses.
Fortunately, the possibility of such a perfect storm is more a risk than a baseline at this point.
Nonetheless, given the extent of its destructive potential, it warrants serious attention by policymakers.
Securing Europe’s economic future in this context will require, first and foremost, a renewed commitment to regional integration efforts – completing the banking union, advancing fiscal union, and moving forward on political union – that have been crowded out by a never-ending series of meetings and summits on Greece.
Likewise, on the national level, pro-growth economic-reform initiatives – which seem to have lost some urgency in the face of overly complacent and excessively accommodating financial markets – need to be revitalized.
This would ease the policy burden on the ECB, which is currently being forced to pursue multiple ambitious objectives that far exceed its capacity to deliver sustainably good outcomes regarding growth, employment, inflation, and financial stability.
The current focus on the downpour in Greece is understandable.
But policymakers should not be so distracted by it that they fail to prepare for the other two possible storms – and, much more worrisome, the possibility that they merge into a single more devastating one.
Europe’s leaders must act now to minimize the risks, lest they find their shelters inadequate to the extreme weather that could lie ahead.
Greece’s Aid Addiction
NEW YORK – The ongoing Greek debt saga is tragic for many reasons, not least among them the fact that the country’s relationship with its creditors is reminiscent of that between the developing world and the aid industry.
Indeed, the succession of bailouts for Greece embodies many of the same pathologies that for decades have pervaded the development agenda – including long-term political consequences that both the financial markets and the Greek people have thus far failed to grasp.
As in the case of other aid programs, the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars has been transferred from richer economies to a much poorer one, with negative, if unintended, consequences.
The rescue program designed to keep Greece from crashing out of the eurozone has raised the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio from 130% at the start of the crisis in 2009 to more than 170% today, with the International Monetary Fund predicting that the debt burden could reach 200% of GDP in the next two years.
This out-of-control debt spiral threatens to flatten the country’s growth trajectory and worsen employment prospects.
Like other aid recipients, Greece has become locked in a codependent relationship with its creditors, which are providing assistance in the form of de facto debt relief through subsidized loans and deferred interest payments.
No reasonable person expects Greece ever to be able to pay off its debts, but the country has become trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of payments and bailouts – making it dependent on its donors for its very survival.
The country’s creditors, for their part, have an incentive to protect the euro and limit the geopolitical risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone.
As a result, even when Greece fails to comply with its creditors’ demands – for, say, tax hikes or pension reforms – it continues to receive assistance with few penalties.
Perversely, the worse the country performs economically, the more aid it receives.
The long-term consequences of this cycle of dependence could be serious.
As long as Greece’s finances are propped up by international creditors, the country’s policymakers will be able to abdicate their responsibility to manage the provision of public goods like education, health care, national security, and infrastructure.
They will also face few incentives to put in place a properly functioning system to collect taxes.
Dependence on aid undermines the implicit contract between citizens and their government, according to which politicians must keep taxpayers satisfied in order to stay in office.
With foreign infusions of cash easing the need for tax revenues, politicians are likely to spend more time courting donors than caring for their constituents.
The weakened connection between public services and taxes not only makes it easier for officials to cling to power, but also increases the scope for corruption and inefficiency.
Indeed, based on the experience of aid-recipient economies in the emerging world, the Greek people may find it increasingly difficult to hold their government accountable or penalize officials for misbehavior or corruption.
So far, the Greek crisis has been treated as a recurring emergency, rather than the structural problem that it is.
And yet, as long as the country remains locked in a cycle of codependence with its creditors, the state of perpetual crisis is likely to persist.
Effective aid programs have almost always been temporary in nature, working – as was the case with the Marshall Plan – through short, sharp, finite interventions.
Open-ended commitments, like aid flows to poor developing countries, have had only limited success, at best.
As long as Greeks view assistance as guaranteed, they will have little incentive to put their country on a path toward self-sufficiency.
Whatever the way forward for Greece, if there is to be any hope of progress, the assistance provided by the European Union and the IMF must come to be regarded as temporary.
Cutting the umbilical cord in a relationship of aid dependency is never easy, and there is no reason to expect that it will be any different with Greece.
Phasing out transfers, even in a considered and systematic way, works only when the recipient is determined to put in place the measures necessary to survive without assistance.
There are few signs that Greece is ready to walk on its own, and as long as the aid continues to flow, that is unlikely to change.
In this sense, markets should view the Greek situation as an equilibrium, not a transition.
Deescalating Europe’s Politics of Resentment
ATHENS – A German television presenter recently broadcast an edited video of me, before I was Greece’s finance minister, giving his country the middle-finger salute.
The fallout has shown the potential impact of an alleged gesture, especially in troubled times.
Indeed, the kerfuffle sparked by the broadcast would not have happened before the 2008 financial crisis, which exposed the flaws in Europe’s monetary union and turned proud countries against one another.
When, in early 2010, Greece’s government could no longer service its debts to French, German, and Greek banks, I campaigned against its quest for an enormous new loan from Europe’s taxpayers to pay off those debts.
I gave three reasons.
First, the new loans did not represent a bailout for Greece so much as a cynical transfer of private losses from the banks’ books onto the shoulders of Greece’s most vulnerable citizens.
How many of Europe’s taxpayers, who have footed the bill for these loans, know that more than 90% of the €240 billion ($260 billion) that Greece borrowed went to financial institutions, not to the Greek state or its people?
Second, it was obvious that if Greece already could not repay its existing loans, the austerity conditions on which the “bailouts” were premised would crush Greek nominal incomes, making the national debt even less sustainable.
When Greeks could no longer make payments on their mountainous debts, German and other European taxpayers would have to step in again.
(Wealthy Greeks, of course, had already shifted their deposits to financial centers like Frankfurt and London.)
Finally, misleading peoples and parliaments by presenting a bank bailout as an act of “solidarity,” while failing to help ordinary Greeks – indeed, setting them up to place an even heavier burden on Germans – was destined to undermine cohesion within the eurozone.
Germans turned against Greeks; Greeks turned against Germans; and, as more countries have faced fiscal hardship, Europe has turned against itself.
The fact is that Greece had no right to borrow from German – or any other European – taxpayers at a time when its public debt was unsustainable.
Before Greece took any loans, it should have initiated debt restructuring and undergone a partial default on debt owed to its private-sector creditors.
But this “radical” argument was largely ignored at the time.
Similarly, European citizens should have demanded that their governments refuse even to consider transferring private losses to them.
But they failed to do so, and the transfer was effected soon after.
The result was the largest taxpayer-backed loan in history, provided on the condition that Greece pursue such strict austerity that its citizens have lost one-quarter of their incomes, making it impossible to repay private or public debts.
The ensuing – and ongoing – humanitarian crisis has been tragic.
Five years after the first bailout was issued, Greece remains in crisis.
Animosity among Europeans is at an all-time high, with Greeks and Germans, in particular, having descended to the point of moral grandstanding, mutual finger-pointing, and open antagonism.
This toxic blame game benefits only Europe’s enemies.
It has to stop.
Only then can Greece – with the support of its European partners, who share an interest in its economic recovery – focus on implementing effective reforms and growth-enhancing policies.
This is essential to placing Greece, finally, in a position to repay its debts and fulfill its obligations to its citizens.
In practical terms, the February 20 Eurogroup agreement, which provided a four-month extension for loan repayments, offers an important opportunity for progress.
As Greece’s leaders urged at an informal meeting in Brussels last week, it should be implemented immediately.
In the longer term, European leaders must work together to redesign the monetary union so that it supports shared prosperity, rather than fueling mutual resentment.
This is a daunting task.
But, with a strong sense of purpose, a united approach, and perhaps a positive gesture or two, it can be accomplished.
This is an updated and extended version of a post at yanisvaroufakis.eu.
Down and Out in Athens and Brussels
NEW YORK – The Greek catastrophe commands the world’s attention for two reasons.
First, we are deeply distressed to watch an economy collapse before our eyes, with bread lines and bank queues not seen since the Great Depression.
Second, we are appalled by the failure of countless leaders and institutions – national politicians, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank – to avert a slow-motion train wreck that has played out over many years.
If this mismanagement continues, not only Greece but also European unity will be fatally undermined.
To save both Greece and Europe, the new bailout package must include two big things not yet agreed.
First, Greece’s banks must be reopened without delay.
The ECB’s decision last week to withhold credit to the country’s banking system, and thereby to shutter the banks, was both inept and catastrophic.
That decision, forced by the ECB’s highly politicized Executive Board, will be studied – and scorned – by historians for years to come.
By closing the Greek banks, the ECB effectively shut down the entire economy (no economy above subsistence level, after all, can survive without a payments system).
The ECB must reverse its decision immediately, because otherwise the banks themselves would very soon become unsalvageable.
Second, deep debt relief must be part of the deal.
The refusal of the rest of Europe, and especially Germany, to acknowledge Greece’s massive debt overhang has been the big lie of this crisis.
Everyone has known the truth – that Greece can never service its current debt obligations in full – but nobody involved in the negotiations would say it.
Greek officials have repeatedly tried to discuss the need to restructure the debt by slashing interest rates, extending maturities, and perhaps cutting the face value of the debt as well.
Yet every attempt by Greece even to raise the issue was brutally rebuffed by its counterparties.
Of course, as soon as the negotiations collapsed two weeks ago, the truth about the Greek debt began to be stated.
The IMF was the first to break the silence, acknowledging that it had been urging debt relief but to no avail.
The United States then let it be known that President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had been trying to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble to offer debt relief to Greece, also without success.
Then even Schäuble himself, by far the staunchest opponent of debt relief, admitted that Greece needed it; but he also claimed that such relief would violate European Union treaty provisions barring bailouts of governments.
Following Schauble’s remarkable acknowledgment (made publicly only after utter catastrophe had struck), Merkel herself opined that perhaps certain kinds of relief (such as cuts in interest rates, rather than in the debt’s face value) could do the job in a way that would be consistent with EU rules.
The fact that the Greek debt overhang was acknowledged only after negotiations had collapsed exposes the deep systemic failures that have brought Greece and Europe to this point.
We see a European system of crisis management that is fraught with ineptitude, extreme politicization, gamesmanship, and unprofessionalism.
I certainly do not mean to excuse Greek clientelism, corruption, and mismanagement as ultimate causes of the country’s predicament.
Yet the failure of the European institutions is more alarming.
Unless the EU can now save Greece, it will not be able to save itself.
The EU today operates something like the US under the Articles of Confederation, which defined the US’s ineffectual governing structure after independence from Britain in 1781 but prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787.
Like the newly independent US, the EU today lacks an empowered and effective executive branch capable of confronting the current economic crisis.
Instead of robust executive leadership tempered by a strong democratic parliament, committees of national politicians run the show in Europe, in practice sidelining (often brazenly) the European Commission.
It is precisely because national politicians attend to national politics, rather than Europe’s broader interests, that the truth about Greece’s debt went unspoken for so long.
The Eurogroup, which comprises the 19 eurozone finance ministers, embodies this destructive dynamic, meeting every few weeks (or even more frequently) to manage Europe’s crisis on the basis of national political prejudices rather than a rational approach to problem-solving.
Germany tends to call the shots, of course, but the discordant national politics of many member states has contributed to one debacle after the next.
It is the Eurogroup, after all, that “solved” Cyprus’s financial crisis by partial confiscation of bank deposits, thereby undermining confidence in Europe’s banks and setting the stage for Greece’s bank panic two years later.
Amid all this dysfunction, one international institution has remained somewhat above the political fray: the IMF.
Its analysis has been by far the most professional and least politicized.
Yet even the IMF allowed itself to be played by the Europeans, especially by the Germans, to the detriment of resolving the Greek crisis many years ago.
Once upon a time, the US might have pushed through policy changes based on the IMF’s technical analysis.
Now, however, the US, the IMF, and the European Commission have all watched from the sidelines as Germany and other national governments have run Greece into the ground.
Europe’s bizarre decision-making structure has allowed domestic German politics to prevail over all other considerations.
And that has meant less interest in an honest resolution of the crisis than in avoiding the appearance of being lenient toward Greece.
Germany’s leaders might rightly fear that their country will be left holding the bill for European bailouts, but the result has been to sacrifice Greece on the altar of an abstract and unworkable idea: “no bailouts.”
Unless some rational compromise is agreed, insistence on that approach will lead only to massive and even more costly defaults.
We are now truly at the endgame.
Greece’s banks have closed, its debt has been acknowledged as unsustainable, and yet the future of both the banks and the debt remains uncertain.
The decisions taken by Europe in the next several days will determine Greece’s fate; wittingly or not, they will determine the EU’s fate as well.
Europe’s Civil War
WASHINGTON, DC – The negotiations leading up to the latest tentative deal on Greece’s debt brought into relief two competing visions of the European Union: the flexible, humane, and political union espoused by France, and the legalistic and economy-focused union promoted by Germany.
As François Heisbourg recently wrote, “By openly contemplating the forced secession of Greece [from the eurozone], Germany has demonstrated that economics trumps political and strategic considerations.
France views the order of factors differently.”
The question now is which vision will prevail?
The Greeks, for their part, have been putting their national identity ahead of their pocketbooks, in ways that economists do not understand and continually fail to predict.
It is economically irrational for Greeks to prefer continued membership in the eurozone, when they could remain in the EU with a restored national currency that they could devalue.
But, for the Greeks, eurozone membership does not mean only that they can use the common currency.
It places their country on a par with Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, as a “full member” of Europe – a position consistent with Greece’s status as the birthplace of Western civilization.
Whereas that stance reflects the vision of an “ever-closer union” that motivated the EU’s founders, Germany’s narrower, economic understanding of European integration cannot inspire ordinary citizens to support the compromises necessary to keep the EU together.
Nor can it withstand the inevitable attacks directed against EU institutions for every action and regulation that citizens dislike and for which national politicians want to avoid responsibility.
The original European Economic Community, created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, was, as the name indicates, economic in nature.
The Treaty itself was hard-headed, grounded in the converging economic interests of France and Germany, with the Benelux countries and Italy rounding out the basis of a new European economy.
But economic integration was underpinned by a vision of peace and prosperity for Europe’s peoples, after centuries of unprecedented violence had culminated in two world wars that reinforced the seemingly eternal enmity between France and Germany.
And, indeed, the language of a larger political union was embedded in Europe’s treaties, to be interpreted by the European Court of Justice and subsequent generations of European decision-makers in ways that supported the construction of a common European polity and identity, as well as a unified economy.
My mother, a young Belgian in the 1950s, remembers the idealism and the excitement of the European federalist movement, with its promise that her generation could create a different future for Europe and the world.
To be sure, the vision of a United States of Europe, espoused by many of those early federalists, looked backward to the founding of the US, rather than forward to a distinctive European venture.
Nonetheless, the EU that emerged – which pools sovereignty sufficiently to benefit from being a powerful regional entity in a world of almost 200 countries while maintaining its members’ distinct languages and cultures – is something new.
That experiment cannot survive if supported only by economic rigor and rules.
What can continue to justify a political entity after the urgent realities and convictions that drove its establishment have faded to the pages of history and civics books or, at best, are the subject of grandparents’ stories?
For the US, those questions arose in the 1840s and 1850s, when the urgent need for a union to secure independence had faded, causing issues and conflicts that had been papered over to resurface.
In particular, slavery was allowed in some states, but prohibited in others, and the 1787 compromise to count each slave as three-fifths of a person when determining a state’s population for representation and taxation was fraying.
Economic differences between the industrial north and the agricultural south meant that discussions over states’ rights were about livelihoods as well as lives.
A horrific war resulted, in which the US defeated the secessionist southern Confederacy and imposed its vision of the union.
Before the war’s end, President Abraham Lincoln created a new narrative, declaring in the Gettysburg Address that it was fought for democracy as much as equality, with the goal of ensuring that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
This account simplified – and, in many ways, distorted – the historical record.
But no matter; the speech became as important a part of American national identity as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
The EU is now facing its own civil war, though one that, fortunately, is free of physical violence.
Without statesmen and stateswomen able to articulate a vision of a shared future worth working and even sacrificing for, the side of unity may not win.
Europe’s national anthem, a circle of stars, and talk of fiscal rectitude and structural reforms cannot compete with the potent messages of the EU’s opponents.
Those opponents, on both the right and the left, are focusing on the everyday living conditions of European citizens – those who feel threatened by migrants and those who are suffering as a result of austerity.
For the EU to continue its march toward a stronger and closer polity and economy –one that nevertheless falls far short of a federal state – it must offer the credible prospect of a better life for all of its citizens.
Just before the final round of the recent Greek negotiations, French President François Hollande said that he did not want a Europe that “no longer progresses.”
Fair enough.
But progress toward what?
Toward liberty, equality, and fraternity for all of Europe?
Toward the dignity and solidarity of all European citizens?
Toward a shared European house that is kept in order?
These are the questions that a new generation of European politicians must answer.
Statesmanship and the Greek Crisis
NEW YORK – Sovereign-debt crises such as the one in Greece can be resolved only through bold steps by both debtor and creditor.
The debtor needs a fresh start through a debt write-off; the creditor must find a way to provide one without rewarding bad behavior.
For a deal to be struck, both sides must have their needs addressed.
Thus, serious reforms and deep debt relief need to go hand in hand.
It is for this reason that Greece and Germany, its largest creditor, need a new modus vivendi in order to resume negotiations.
To begin with, the Greek government must be clear about the need for urgent economic reforms.
The country’s economy has not just collapsed; it is structurally moribund.
The roots of Greece’s problems stretch far deeper than the austerity of recent years.
In 2013, for example, resident inventors in Germany filed some 917 patent applications for every million inhabitants.
Resident inventors in Greece, by contrast, filed just 69 patent applications for every million.
If Greece wants the prosperity associated with a technologically advanced, twenty-first-century economy, it will have to earn it, by producing innovative products that are competitive on world markets, just as Germany does.
Doing so is likely to be a generational challenge.
For its part, Germany must acknowledge the enormity of Greece’s collapse.
The Greek economy has shrunk by around 25% since 2009; unemployment stands at 27%, with youth unemployment at nearly 50%.
When Germany faced comparable conditions in the early 1930s, its creditors shrugged, and the resulting instability allowed for the rise of Adolf Hitler.
After World War II, however, Germany’s debt was slashed, enabling it to rebuild.
Given this experience, it should understand the importance of cutting a country’s debt when the burden of servicing it becomes unsustainable.
The case for offering a country a fresh financial start is both economic and moral.
This makes it difficult for many bankers to understand, as their industry knows no morality – only the bottom line.
Politicians, too, tend to have their moral compasses calibrated to the relentless hunt for votes.
Finding effective and moral solutions requires genuine statesmanship – something that has been all too rare during the euro crisis.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel now have the opportunity to rise to the occasion as European statesmen.
Since Tsipras’s election in January, German officials have barely been able to contain their fury that a left-wing upstart government of a tiny, bankrupt country would dare to challenge one of the world’s great economies.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, for example, has repeatedly sought to provoke Greece into leaving the eurozone.
Tsipras’s response to these provocations has been clear and consistent: Greece should stay in the eurozone, and it needs a fresh financial start to do so.
On July 5, the Greek people backed their young, charismatic leader with a decisive “No” vote on the unreasonable demands of their country’s creditors.
Their decision will one day be recognized as a victory for Europe over those who preferred to carve up the eurozone, rather than give Greece the chance to start anew within it.
At the likely meeting between Tsipras and Merkel this week in Brussels, the stakes could not be higher.
The economic costs of the impasse have been catastrophic for Greece, and pose a grave threat to Europe.
The breakdown of negotiations last week sparked a bank panic, leaving Greece’s economy paralyzed and its banks on the verge of insolvency.
If the banks are to be revived at all, they must be saved within days.
If Tsipras and Merkel meet as mere politicians, the results will be catastrophic.
Greece’s banks will be pushed to the point of failure, making the costs of saving Greece and the eurozone prohibitively high.
If the two leaders meet as statesmen, however, they will save Greece, the eurozone, and the faltering European spirit.
With the promise of deep debt relief for Greece and a rapprochement between Greece and Germany, economic confidence will return.
Deposits will flow back into Greek banks.
The economy will come back to life.
Tsipras needs to assure Merkel that Greece will live within its means, not as a chronic ward of Europe.
To ensure such an outcome, debt relief and tough reforms should be phased in over time, according to an agreed schedule, with each party following through on its commitments, as long as the other does, as well.
Fortunately, Greece is a country of exceptional talents, capable of building new competitive sectors from the ground up, if given the chance.
Merkel must now take a stance that is the opposite of the one her finance minister has pursued to date.
Schäuble is undoubtedly one of Europe’s towering political figures, but his strategy for saving the eurozone by pushing Greece out was misguided.
Merkel now must step in to save Greece as part of the eurozone – and that means easing the country’s debt burden.
To do otherwise at this stage would create an irreparable split between Europe’s rich and poor, and powerful and weak.
Some – in particular, the ever-cynical bankers – argue that it is too late for Europe to save itself.
It is not.
In Europe, many influential leaders and citizens still view the marketplace as constrained by moral considerations, such as the need to alleviate economic suffering.
This is an invaluable asset.
It makes it possible for Merkel to offer Greece a fresh start, because it is the right thing to do and because it accords with Germany’s own experience and history.
That idea of an ethical approach to the Greek crisis might sound absurd to readers of the financial press, and many politicians will undoubtedly consider it naive.
Yet most European citizens could embrace it as a sensible solution.
Europe rose from the rubble of World War II because of the vision of statesmen; now it has been brought to the verge of collapse by the everyday vanities, corruption, and cynicism of bankers and politicians.
It is time for statesmanship to return – for the sake of current and future generations in Europe and the world.
Don’t Lend to Your Euro Friends
MUNICH – After months of games and brinkmanship, and only a week after Greek voters rejected the conditions for a €7.5 billion ($8.2 billion) rescue package, the end came swiftly.
The eurozone’s political leaders agreed to start negotiations on a much larger package, worth €86 billion, almost half of Greece’s GDP.
Unfortunately, the deal reveals Europe’s apparent determination to reenact the same tragedy in the future.
Over the past five years, a whopping €344 billion has flowed from official creditors like the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund into the coffers of the Greek government and the country’s commercial banks.
But after six months of near-futile negotiations, exhaustion had set in and holidays were beckoning; so the actual conditions for a new Greek rescue were given short shrift.
Although the European Financial Stability Facility had officially declared Greece bankrupt on July 3, the eurozone’s leaders kicked the insolvency can down the road yet again.
The latest agreement did halt, or at least interrupt, the eurozone’s biggest crisis to date, culminating in an unprecedented period of antipathy, opprobrium, humiliation, pestering, and blackmail within Europe.
Indeed, Greece came within a hair’s breadth of leaving the eurozone.
Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis revealed that after taking office, he assembled a group, with the consent of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, that met in secret to prepare the introduction of a parallel currency and the takeover of Greece’s central bank – effectively an exit (or “Grexit”) from the eurozone.
Germany’s government also was ready to accept what appeared to be the inevitable.
Had French President François Hollande not advised Greece behind German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s back about how to negotiate, events could have taken an entirely different course.
The bitter dispute within the Eurogroup (comprising the eurozone countries’ finance ministers) not only strained relations among the monetary union’s members, but also fueled tensions within national governments.
Many European leaders are still smarting and licking their wounds.
But this should also be a time for them to reflect on what happened and why.
The spat resulted from an attempt to set politics above the laws of economics.
The dogma of European policymakers’ infallibility and the irrevocability of every step toward integration collided with reality.
Europe will face many such conflicts in the future if it continues to apply the same approach to its debt problems that it used in the Greek case.
The fundamental error occurred in April and May 2010, when official lenders – in the form of other eurozone member states – replaced Greece’s private creditors.
That arrangement was proposed by then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, in clear breach of the Maastricht Treaty’s no-bailout rule, which had been Germany’s fundamental condition for giving up the Deutschmark.
But French President Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to leave the euro (as Spain’s former prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, later revealed to the newspaper El País) unless Germany signed on to the bailout agreement.
Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister at the time, said, “We violated all the rules because we wanted to close ranks and really rescue the eurozone.”
The rules were indeed violated, but whether the bailout decision rescued the euro remains to be seen.
It certainly rescued many commercial banks, whose exposure toward the Greek state was substantial by the first quarter of 2010.
Greek banks had lent most to the Greek government (€29 billion), followed by French banks (€20 billion), German banks (€17 billion), and US banks (€4 billion).
The bailout also rescued the ECB, insofar as the fiscal credit replaced some of the Bank’s Target credit that had built up from the beginning of 2008.
At that time, the Greek economy confronted a sudden stop of private capital inflows, and the Greek central bank financed the country’s entire current-account deficit with additional refinancing credit from its local electronic printing press.
But rescuing banks is not the same as rescuing the euro.
Moreover, rescuing the euro is not the same as rescuing the European project.
The bailout decision in 2010 transformed a normal commercial dispute between creditors and debtors – one that always arises when debtors fail to repay – into a dispute among sovereign states.
This whipped up animosity among Europe’s peoples and provided ammunition for radical parties of all stripes, severely damaging the European integration process.
Without the socialization of debt provided by the rescue packages, Varoufakis, or whoever led Greece’s finance ministry, would have had to declare insolvency and then confront private creditors from a variety of countries.
These countries’ governments would then have felt compelled to rescue tottering banks with their taxpayers’ money.
To be sure, rescuing local banks would have been no walk in the park.
But it would have spared Europe the spectacle of its member states’ governments baring their teeth at one another.
In 2008, Germany rescued Hypo Real Estate, and in 2011 Belgium, France, and Luxembourg bailed out Dexia Bank.
As these cases suggest, cleaning one’s own porch could have been done without much of a fuss, or at least without stoking international tension.
Banks and their media enablers always predict disaster when write-offs loom.
Trembling politicians then usually acquiesce and put their taxpayers on the hook.
But the more than 180 sovereign defaults that have occurred since 1945 did not push the defaulters off a cliff.
Instead, as a rule, they gained a fresh start.
In fact, the dangers that are now facing Europe as a result of socializing debts are far greater than those posed by a mere potential financial crisis.
The lesson to be drawn from the Greek debacle is that the eurozone must develop sovereign insolvency procedures as quickly as possible, thereby preventing other sovereigns from becoming creditors through debt mutualization.
If the European Union’s national governments want to help one another in a crisis, they should unilaterally provide humanitarian aid, without conditionality and without redemption.
If you lend to your friend, he will no longer be your friend.
Unless that wisdom is heeded, it will be impossible to hold Europe together.
A Greek Suicide?
LONDON – The good news is that a Greek default, which has become more likely after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ provocative rejection of what he described as the “absurd” bailout offer by Greece’s creditors, no longer poses a serious threat to the rest of Europe.
The bad news is that Tsipras does not seem to understand this.
To judge by Tsipras’s belligerence, he firmly believes that Europe needs Greece as desperately as Greece needs Europe.
This is the true “absurdity” in the present negotiations, and Tsipras’ misapprehension of his bargaining power now risks catastrophe for his country, humiliation for his Syriza party, or both.
The most likely outcome is that Tsipras will eat his words and submit to the conditions set by the “troika” (the European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) before the end of June.
If not, the ECB will stop supporting the Greek banking system, and the government will run out of money to service foreign debts and, more dramatically, to pay Greek citizens their pensions and wages.
Cut off from all external finance, Greece will become an economic pariah – the Argentina of Europe – and public pressure will presumably oust Syriza from power.
This outcome is all the more tragic, given that the economic analysis underlying Syriza’s demand for an easing of austerity was broadly right.
Instead of seeking a face-saving compromise on softening the troika program, Tsipras wasted six months on symbolic battles over economically irrelevant issues such as labor laws, privatizations, even the name of the troika.
This provocative behavior lost Greece all potential allies in France and Italy.
Worse still, the time wasted on political grandstanding destroyed the primary budget surplus, which was Tsipras’s trump card in the early negotiations.
Now Tsipras thinks he holds another trump card: Europe’s fear of a Greek default.
But this is a delusion promoted by his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis.
A professor of game theory, Varoufakis recently boasted to the New York Times that “little Greece, in order to survive, [could] bring down the financial world,” and that his media image “as an irrational fool… is doing my work for me” by frightening other EU finance ministers.
Apparently, Varoufakis believes that his “sophisticated grasp of game theory” gives Greece a crucial advantage in “the complicated dynamics” of the negotiations.
In fact, the game being played out in Europe is less like chess than like tic-tac-toe, where a draw is the normal outcome, but a wrong move means certain defeat.
The rules of this game are much simpler than Varoufakis expected because of a momentous event that occurred in the same week as the Greek election.
On January 22, the ECB took decisive action to protect the eurozone from a possible Greek default.
By announcing a huge program of bond purchases, much bigger relative to the eurozone bond market than the quantitative easing implemented in the United States, Britain, or Japan, ECB President Mario Draghi erected the impenetrable firewall that had long been needed to protect the monetary Union from a Lehman-style financial meltdown.
The ECB’s newfound ability to print money, essentially without limit, to support both banks and governments has reduced Greek contagion to insignificance.
That represents a profound change in Europe’s financial environment, which Greek politicians, along with many economic analysts, still fail to understand.
Before the ECB’s decision, contagion from Greece was a genuine threat.
If the Greek government defaulted or tried to abandon the euro, Greece’s banks would collapse, and Greeks who failed to get their money out of the country would lose their savings, as occurred in Cyprus in 2013.
When savers in other indebted euro countries such as Portugal and Spain observed this, they would fear similar losses and move their money to banks in Germany or Austria, as well as sell their holdings of Portuguese or Spanish government bonds.
As a result, the debtor countries’ bond prices would collapse, interest rates would soar, and banks would be threatened with collapse.
If the contagion from Greece intensified, the next-weakest country, probably Portugal, would find itself unable to support its banking system or pay its debts.
In extremis, it would abandon the euro, following the Greek example.
Before January, this sequence of events was quite likely, but the ECB’s bond-buying program put a firebreak at each point of the contagion process.
If holders of Portuguese bonds are alarmed by a future Greek default, the ECB will simply increase its bond buying; with no limit to its buying power, it will easily overwhelm any selling pressure.
If savers in Portuguese banks start moving their money to Germany, the ECB will recycle these euros back to Portugal through interbank deposits.
Again, there is no limit to how much money the ECB can recycle, provided Portuguese banks remain solvent – which they will, so long as the ECB continues to buy Portuguese government bonds.
In short, the ECB bond-buying program has transformed the ECB from a passive observer of the euro crisis, paralyzed by the outdated legalistic constraints of the Maastricht Treaty, into a proper lender of last resort.
With powers to monetize government debts similar to those exercised by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England, the ECB can now guarantee the eurozone against financial contagion.
Unfortunately for Greece, this has been lost on the Tsipras government.
Greek politicians who still see the threat of financial contagion as their trump card should note the coincidence of the Greek election and the ECB’s bond-buying program and draw the obvious conclusion.
The ECB’s new policy was designed to protect the euro from the consequences of a Greek exit or default.
The latest Greek negotiating strategy is to demand a ransom to desist threatening suicide.
Such blackmail might work for a suicide bomber.
But Greece is just holding a gun to its own head – and Europe does not need to care very much if it pulls the trigger.
What Is Plan B for Greece?
TOKYO – Financial markets have greeted the election of Greece’s new far-left government in predictable fashion.
But, though the Syriza party’s victory sent Greek equities and bonds plummeting, there is little sign of contagion to other distressed countries on the eurozone periphery.
Spanish ten-year bonds, for example, are still trading at interest rates below US Treasuries.
The question is how long this relative calm will prevail.
Greece’s fire-breathing new government, it is generally assumed, will have little choice but to stick to its predecessor’s program of structural reform, perhaps in return for a modest relaxation of fiscal austerity.
Nonetheless, the political, social, and economic dimensions of Syriza’s victory are too significant to be ignored.
Indeed, it is impossible to rule out completely a hard Greek exit from the euro (“Grexit”), much less capital controls that effectively make a euro inside Greece worth less elsewhere.
Some eurozone policymakers seem to be confident that a Greek exit from the euro, hard or soft, will no longer pose a threat to the other periphery countries.
They might be right; then again, back in 2008, US policymakers thought that the collapse of one investment house, Bear Stearns, had prepared markets for the bankruptcy of another, Lehman Brothers.
We know how that turned out.
True, there have been some important policy and institutional advances since early 2010, when the Greek crisis first began to unfold.
The new banking union, however imperfect, and the European Central Bank’s vow to save the euro by doing “whatever it takes,” are essential to sustaining the monetary union.
Another crucial innovation has been the development of the European Stability Mechanism, which, like the International Monetary Fund, has the capacity to execute vast financial bailouts, subject to conditionality.
And yet, even with these new institutional backstops, the global financial risks of Greece’s instability remain profound.
It is not hard to imagine Greece’s brash new leaders underestimating Germany’s intransigence on debt relief or renegotiation of structural-reform packages.
It is also not hard to imagine Eurocrats miscalculating political dynamics in Greece.
In any scenario, most of the burden of adjustment will fall on Greece.
Any profligate country that is suddenly forced to live within its means has a huge adjustment to make, even if all of its past debts are forgiven.
And Greece’s profligacy was epic.
In the run-up to its debt crisis in 2010, the government’s primary budget deficit (the amount by which government expenditure on goods and services exceeds revenues, excluding interest payments on its debt) was equivalent to an astonishing 10% of national income.
Once the crisis erupted and Greece lost access to new private lending, the “troika” (the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission) provided massively subsidized long-term financing.
But even if Greece’s debt had been completely wiped out, going from a primary deficit of 10% of GDP to a balanced budget requires massive belt tightening –&nbsp;and, inevitably, recession.
Germans have a point when they argue that complaints about “austerity” ought to be directed at Greece’s previous governments.
These governments’ excesses lifted Greek consumption far above a sustainable level; a fall to earth was unavoidable.
Nonetheless, Europe needs to be much more generous in permanently writing down debt and, even more urgently, in reducing short-term repayment flows.
The first is necessary to reduce long-term uncertainty; the second is essential to facilitate near-term growth.
Let’s face it: Greece’s bind today is hardly all of its own making.
(Greece’s young people – who now often take a couple of extra years to complete college, because their teachers are so often on strike – certainly did not cause it.)
First and foremost, the eurozone countries’ decision to admit Greece to the single currency in 2002 was woefully irresponsible, with French advocacy deserving much of the blame.
Back then, Greece conspicuously failed to meet a plethora of basic convergence criteria, owing to its massive debt and its relative economic and political backwardness.
Second, much of the financing for Greece’s debts came from German and French banks that earned huge profits by intermediating loans from their own countries and from Asia.
They poured this money into a fragile state whose fiscal credibility ultimately rested on being bailed out by other euro members.
Third, Greece’s eurozone partners wield a massive stick that is typically absent in sovereign-debt negotiations.
If Greece does not accept the conditions imposed on it to maintain its membership in the single currency, it risks being thrown out of the European Union altogether.
Even after two bailout packages, it is unrealistic to expect Greek taxpayers to start making large repayments anytime soon – not with unemployment at 25% (and above 50% for young people).
Germany and other hawkish northern Europeans are right to insist that Greece adhere to its commitments on structural reform, so that economic convergence with the rest of the eurozone can occur one day.
But they ought to be making even deeper concessions on debt repayments, where the overhang still creates considerable policy uncertainty for investors.
If concessions to Greece create a precedent that other countries might exploit, so be it.
Sooner rather than later, other periphery countries will also need help.
Greece, one hopes, will not be forced to leave the eurozone, though temporary options such as imposing capital controls may ultimately prove necessary to prevent a financial meltdown.
The eurozone must continue to bend, if it is not to break.
Reforming Greek Reform
PRINCETON – Greece's new government, led by the anti-austerity Syriza party, presents the eurozone with a challenge that it has not yet had to face: dealing with national officials who are outside the traditional European mainstream.
Syriza is in many ways a radical party, and its views on economic policy are often described as hard left; but the party's take on debt and austerity is supported by many perfectly mainstream economists in Europe and America.
So what sets Syriza apart?
All negotiations between debtors and creditors involve bluff and bluster to some extent.
But Greece's maverick finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has taken his case boldly to the media and the public in a way that leaves little doubt as to his willingness to play hard ball.
One might expect that the negotiations between the Greeks and the "troika" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) would be mainly about reaching an agreement about the economics of the situation.
But that would be wishful thinking.
The Germans, along with smaller creditor countries, are dead-set against any relaxation of austerity and are adamant that “structural reform" must remain a condition of further financing.
They think that offering easier terms would be economically counterproductive, not least because it would give the Greeks an opportunity to go back to their bad old ways.
So what is unfolding before our eyes is not a rational discussion of economics but pure haggling.
And just about the only bargaining chip that Varoufakis holds may be the implicit threat that Greece could leave the euro ("Grexit").
The threat is only implicit; most Greeks do not want Grexit, and Varoufakis and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras have shied away of late from stating such intentions.
But, without the threat, Varoufakis's claims of democratic legitimacy would most likely fall on deaf ears in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Brussels.
Syriza would have no choice but to continue the economic program it was elected to revoke.
The effectiveness of the Grexit threat depends on two conditions.
First, Germany and other eurozone members must regard Grexit as a significant risk to themselves.
Second, a return to the drachma must offer the prospect that the Greek economy will eventually do better on its own than in the currency union (and under the existing economic program).
In the absence of the first condition, the eurozone will respond to Greece by saying, "Be our guest, leave."
In the absence of the second condition, Greece's threat will not be credible.
And here is where economics re-enters the picture.
Consider the first condition.
Some observers seem to have convinced themselves that any Grexit spillovers would be manageable.
Greece is both small and in a uniquely desperate position.
So it is possible that other fragile members – Spain, Portugal, and Italy – would be spared from financial contagion and the euro's viability would not be dramatically affected.
But the consequences are so unpredictable, and the costs of any domino effect potentially so large, that Germany and other creditors have no interest in precipitating a Grexit scenario.
On the contrary, presiding over the eurozone's breakup must be one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's worst nightmares.
And if it is not, it should be.
The second condition, concerning the effects on the Greek economy, is tougher to sort out.
Here, too, there are plenty of disaster scenarios.
Grexit would require capital controls and financial isolation, at least for some time.
The resulting uncertainty about policies and prices might produce a severe adverse shock on the real economy, sending unemployment to even greater heights.
But there are clear examples of positive economic outcomes resulting from breaking a similar currency bond.
Britain dropped out of the Gold Standard early, in 1931, so that it could ease monetary conditions and reduce interest rates, and it did better than countries that delayed the exit until later.
Argentina abandoned its fixed exchange rate against the US dollar in 2001, and experienced rapid recovery after two bad quarters.
In both cases, regaining monetary sovereignty allowed a more competitive currency, which in turn increased export demand and assisted economic recovery.
Under Grexit, Greece's best hope would be something similar – a sharp boost in external competitiveness.
The Greek government has limited room for fiscal stimulus, and it would be shut out of financial markets.
A cheaper currency could, in principle, reverse the effects of austerity.
Currency depreciation works by lowering domestic costs in foreign-currency terms.
One such cost has already come down significantly in Greece.
Since the onset of the crisis, Greek wages have dropped by more than 15% – a process called, appropriately enough, internal devaluation.
Yet the response in terms of exports has been disappointing.
Though the country's whopping current-account deficit is gone, this reflects a collapse of imports – a result of austerity – rather than an export boom.
This fact on its own suggests that bringing back the drachma might not help Greece much.
Greek exports appear to have been hampered by other factors.
Higher energy costs (owing to increases in both excise taxes and electricity rates), credit bottlenecks, specialization in stagnant export markets, and generalized policy uncertainty all seem to have played a role.
As a result, Greek export prices have not come down nearly as much as wages.
Grexit might conceivably help with some of these costs, but it will aggravate others (such as policy uncertainty).
In the short to medium run, increasing Greek competitiveness requires remedies targeted at specific binding constraints faced by exporters.
A Greek program that identifies these constraints and proposes remedies would be much better economics than blind adherence to the troika's laundry list of structural reforms.
It would also offer a credible alternative to remaining in the eurozone under current terms, thereby strengthening Greece's hand in bargaining for a deal that ensures that Grexit does not in fact occur.
Greek Lessons for Europe
BERLIN - “It’s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked,” the legendary investor Warren Buffett aptly remarked when the global economic crisis hit.
And, as we have found out in the meantime, this is as true for countries as it is for companies.
Following Ireland, Greece is now the second euro-zone member to have gotten into massive payment difficulties due to the crisis, almost to the point of national bankruptcy.
Ireland was able to resolve its problems by itself, through a restructuring policy that was painful yet unflinching.
It could do so because its economy, apart from its excessive debt burden following the collapse of an asset bubble, was basically sound.
The situation in Greece is different.
A restructuring of the economy will be much more difficult, because it will have to be more far-reaching.
The fiscal deficit must now be redressed resulted not just from internal financial imbalances, but also from a political system that for too long time has been in denial of reality, allowing the country to live beyond its means.
Nevertheless, the European Union can neither allow Greece to slide into national bankruptcy nor hand it over to the International Monetary Fund, since other euro-zone members – namely, Portugal, Spain, and Italy – would probably be next in line to be attacked by the financial markets.
In that case, the euro would be in danger of failing, for the first time seriously imperiling the entire project of European integration.
The real problem at the heart of the Greek crisis is so grave because it involves the fundamental weakness of the euro: its lack of support by a government policy.
The caps on member states’ budget deficits and public debt imposed by the Maastricht criteria have proven relatively early on to be of limited use in the real world, and the same is true for the monitoring tools linked to these limits.
In any case, the Maastricht rules were never designed for a perfect storm like the one triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The euro, which turned out to be the critical tool for defending European interests in this crisis, will now be subjected to an endurance test directed at the soft political heart of its construction.
Europe’s leaders – first and foremost Germany and France, which will play the deciding role – must act quickly and put through new, imaginative solutions.
This will not come cheap, and therefore will entail substantial political risks.
But, given a global economic environment that promises scant sustainable growth in the coming years, things could otherwise get very tough very soon.
The solutions that Europe’s leaders provide must go beyond Maastricht, but without triggering new institutional debates, which would lead us nowhere.
Moreover, new instruments like Eurobonds will have to be made available in order to reduce the affected euro-zone countries’ interest burden, provided that they have taken serious steps – subject to effective control mechanisms – toward credible restructuring.
The current crisis has, however, also shown that the Council of Finance Ministers (Ecofin) is unable to assert such control over EU member states’ fiscal policies.
The direct leadership of heads of state and government is needed, at least in these times of extreme crisis.
One sign of hope is that, following the recent Franco-German summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time did not publicly oppose the idea of a European economic government.
Spelling out such a body’s structure, costs, decision-making procedures, and control mechanisms as quickly as possible is now the order of the day.
Indeed, there is no time to lose.
But even with one, two, or three steps forward, the German and French governments will be taking great political risks domestically if the euro crisis in the Mediterranean worsens and a financial bailout there becomes necessary to save the common currency.
The populations in the countries that will have to foot the bill are unprepared for the reality check ahead of them, adding fuel to a years-long growth in Euro-skepticism, which now pervades all political camps.
This applies increasingly to Germany as well, making it very likely that we will see an extremely large political problem emerge there in the near future.
Pay for the southern European countries or resign oneself to the end of the euro?
The question alone makes clear what this crisis is about: the future of the European project.
At the same time, muddling through – a typically European answer that limits political risk while not really changing anything – will be difficult, because the consequences of the global economic crisis have not yet been fully addressed.
What is necessary now is statesman-like leadership – and even more so states woman -like leadership.
Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy are facing the defining challenge of their respective terms in office.
They must navigate the European ship safely through this storm.
Only courageous thinking and action will enable them to steer clear of the rocks.
The Greece of the Caribbean
NEW YORK – There was a time when it might have been said that Puerto Rico, in the midst of a wrenching debt crisis, was returning to its Latin roots.
After all, Latin American governments were once world leaders in over-indebtedness.
But the United States’ public debt now stands at over 100% of its GDP, and Detroit has just gone through bankruptcy.
Perhaps Puerto Rico is, at last, becoming more American.
Or perhaps it is becoming more European, given the resemblance of its debt problems to those of Greece.
After the adoption of the euro, Greece was able to borrow at interest rates not much higher than those paid by northern European countries, even though its fiscal policy was worlds apart from that of Germany or Finland.
The result was massive debt accumulation to fund current expenditure, not investment.
Puerto Rico – a US territory – was also allowed to borrow too much for too long.
Its government bonds are tax-exempt everywhere in the US, and hence particularly attractive to US investors, who, despite the increasingly perilous state of the island’s finances, have gorged on them.
So, Bloomberg reports, Puerto Rico has more debt – over $70 billion – than any US state government except California and New York, while its economy is smaller than that of Kansas.
Another similarity has to do with relative prices.
Once it gave up the drachma, Greece was no longer able to devalue in order to cut the value of domestic wages in terms of foreign currency, and thus spur exports.
With competitiveness lagging, the trade deficit soared, and so did unemployment.
Puerto Rico’s predicament is similar, but again with a twist that makes it more serious.
The island uses the US dollar, and the US Congress imposed on Puerto Rico the federal minimum wage, even though its per capita income is – as Anne Krueger has pointed out – about half that of the poorest US state.
Puerto Ricans’ freedom to move to the mainland was not enough to keep unemployment from becoming a secular problem: around 11% before the 2008 financial crisis, a 17% peak in 2010, and above 12% recently.
As in Greece, there is plenty of blame to go around.
Critics point to weak budget institutions, muddled accounting, and rampant fiscal populism among island politicians.
Proud Puerto Ricans retort that US banks and hedge funds were complicit by happily loading up on island debt.
Both sides are right.
Puerto Rico and its leaders can learn three important lessons from Greece.
First, it is no use pretending that debt reduction can be avoided.
And when the time comes, action must be sufficiently bold to do away with the debt overhang and encourage private investment.
The European Union dithered for years before acknowledging that private loans to Greece should be written down.
Then it negotiated an insufficient haircut and ended up dithering again – resorting to accounting tricks to avoid writing down European public-sector loans.
The story would have been very different if the need for substantial debt reduction had been accepted upfront.
The same holds for Puerto Rico, except that – yet again – the situation is more complicated, owing to the vagaries of US law.
Puerto Rico cannot declare bankruptcy under Chapter 9 (neither can any of the 50 states).
In 1984, Congress adopted an amendment that also denied Puerto Rico’s municipalities and public corporations access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.
Puerto Rico recently tried to enact legislation modeled on Chapter 9 that would allow for an orderly restructuring of the debt of public corporations and municipalities.
But creditors have challenged the move in court, with the US Supreme Court set to issue a ruling by the end of June.
So exactly how debt reduction will happen in Puerto Rico remains unclear.
But whether it will happen is in little doubt; when it does, it better be large.
The second lesson is that policymakers must put fiscal policy on a sustainable path, while recognizing that austerity alone is not the answer.
Puerto Rico’s economy had been shrinking before the fiscal crisis, and the spending cuts and tax increases since it erupted have only made matters worse.
The island risks sharing Greece’s fate, with the debt-to-GDP ratio continuing to rise as austerity deepens the recession.
In exchange for help, congressional Republicans are threatening to impose on Puerto Rico a fiscal control board similar to the one established in 1995 in response to the fiscal crisis in Washington, DC.
Bad idea.
Not only would such a board smack of colonialism and be politically untenable; the scheme would also lack the flexibility needed to avoid a depression in Puerto Rico, while reassuring everyone, including investors, that fiscal policy will remain prudent in the future.
A much better solution is a rule of fiscal responsibility like those adopted in countries as different as New Zealand, Sweden, Colombia, and Chile.
The idea is to keep expenditure below what the government can raise in taxes in the long run (thereby ensuring sustainability), while allowing deficits whenever the economy is operating below potential and tax revenue is abnormally low (thereby guaranteeing flexibility and contributing to macroeconomic stabilization).
In Chile, the rule allowed the government to pay back debt gradually and eventually turn itself into a net creditor, while at the same time reducing the volatility of public investment and output.
There is no reason why a similar arrangement could not work in Puerto Rico.
The third lesson from Greece is that macro tinkering is not enough; highly indebted countries also need a credible growth strategy.
Puerto Rico is no exception.
For a long time, the island’s economy grew on the basis of corporate tax incentives.
But, beginning in 1996, the US Congress did away with those tax breaks, without producing any blueprint for development.
On the contrary, Puerto Rico is stuck with an early-twentieth-century law that forces all trade with the mainland to be conducted with expensive US ships, increasing transport costs and undermining economic competitiveness.
All that must change.
Puerto Rico will not pay its debts – not even what is left after debt reduction – unless its economy grows.
US creditors and lawmakers must accept that reality, and act accordingly.
Greek Lessons for the World Economy
CAMBRIDGE – The $140 billion support package that the Greek government has finally received from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund gives it the breathing space needed to undertake the difficult job of putting its finances in order.
The package may or may not prevent Spain and Portugal from becoming undone in a similar fashion, or indeed even head off an eventual Greek default.
Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the Greek debacle has given the EU a black eye.
Deep down, the crisis is yet another manifestation of what I call “the political trilemma of the world economy”: economic globalization, political democracy, and the nation-state are mutually irreconcilable.
We can have at most two at one time.
Democracy is compatible with national sovereignty only if we restrict globalization.
If we push for globalization while retaining the nation-state, we must jettison democracy.
And if we want democracy along with globalization, we must shove the nation-state aside and strive for greater international governance.
The history of the world economy shows the trilemma at work.
The first era of globalization, which lasted until 1914, was a success as long as economic and monetary policies remained insulated from domestic political pressures.
These policies could then be entirely subjugated to the demands of the gold standard and free capital mobility.
But once the political franchise was enlarged, the working class got organized, and mass politics became the norm, domestic economic objectives began to compete with (and overwhelm) external rules and constraints.
The classic case is Britain’s short-lived return to gold in the interwar period.
The attempt to reconstitute the pre-World War I model of globalization collapsed in 1931, when domestic politics forced the British government to choose domestic reflation over the gold standard.
The architects of the Bretton Woods regime kept this lesson in mind when they redesigned the world’s monetary system in 1944.
They understood that democratic countries would need the space to conduct independent monetary and fiscal policies.
So they contemplated only a “thin” globalization, with capital flows restricted largely to long-term lending and borrowing.
John Maynard Keynes, who wrote the rules along with Harry Dexter White, viewed capital controls not as a temporary expedient but as a permanent feature of the global economy.
The Bretton Woods regime collapsed in the 1970’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows.
The third path identified by the trilemma is to do away with national sovereignty altogether.
In this case, economic integration can be married with democracy through political union among states.
The loss in national sovereignty is then compensated by the “internationalization” of democratic politics.
Think of this as a global version of federalism.
The United States, for example, created a unified national market once its federal government wrested sufficient political control from individual states.
This was far from a smooth process, as the American Civil War amply demonstrates.
The EU’s difficulties stem from the fact that the global financial crisis caught Europe midway through a similar process.
European leaders always understood that economic union needs to have a political leg to stand on.
Even though some, such as the British, wished to give the Union as little power as possible, the force of the argument was with those who pressed for political integration alongside economic integration.
Still, the European political project fell far short of the economic one.
Greece benefited from a common currency, unified capital markets, and free trade with other EU member states.
But it does not have automatic access to a European lender of last resort.
Its citizens do not receive unemployment checks from Brussels the way that, say, Californians do from Washington, DC, when California experiences a recession.
Nor, given linguistic and cultural barriers, can unemployed Greeks move just as easily across the border to a more prosperous European state.
And Greek banks and firms lose their creditworthiness alongside their government if markets perceive the latter to be insolvent.
The German and French governments, for their part, have had little say over Greece’s budget policies.
They could not stop the Greek government from borrowing (indirectly) from the European Central Bank (ECB) as long as credit rating agencies deemed Greek debt creditworthy.
If Greece chooses default, they cannot enforce their banks’ claims on Greek borrowers or seize Greek assets.
Nor can they prevent Greece from leaving the eurozone.
What all this means is that the financial crisis has turned out to be a lot deeper and its resolution considerably messier than necessary.
The French and German governments have grudgingly come up with a major loan package, but only after considerable delay and with the IMF standing at their side.
The ECB has lowered the threshold of creditworthiness that Greek government securities must meet in order to allow continued Greek borrowing.
The success of the rescue is far from assured, in view of the magnitude of belt-tightening that it calls for and the hostility that it has aroused on the part of Greek workers.
When push comes to shove, domestic politics trumps foreign creditors.
The crisis has revealed how demanding globalization’s political prerequisites are.
It shows how much European institutions must still evolve to underpin a healthy single market.
The choice that the EU faces is the same in other parts of the world: either integrate politically, or ease up on economic unification.
Before the crisis, Europe looked like the most likely candidate to make a successful transition to the first equilibrium – greater political unification.
Now its economic project lies in tatters while the leadership needed to rekindle political integration is nowhere to be seen.  
The best that can be said is that Europe will no longer be able to delay making the choice that the Greek affair has laid bare.  If you are an optimist, you might even conclude that Europe will therefore ultimately emerge stronger.
A Blueprint for Greece’s Recovery
ATHENS – Months of negotiations between our government and the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the European Central Bank have produced little progress.
One reason is that all sides are focusing too much on the strings to be attached to the next liquidity injection and not enough on a vision of how Greece can recover and develop sustainably.
If we are to break the current impasse, we must envisage a healthy Greek economy.
Sustainable recovery requires synergistic reforms that unleash the country’s considerable potential by removing bottlenecks in several areas: productive investment, credit provision, innovation, competition, social security, public administration, the judiciary, the labor market, cultural production, and, last but not least, democratic governance.
Seven years of debt deflation, reinforced by the expectation of everlasting austerity, have decimated private and public investment and forced anxious, fragile banks to stop lending.
With the government lacking fiscal room, and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans, it is important to mobilize the state’s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector.
To restore investment and credit to levels consistent with economic escape velocity, a recovering Greece will require two new public institutions that work side by side with the private sector and with European institutions: A development bank that harnesses public assets and a “bad bank” that enables the banking system to get out from under their non-performing assets and restore the flow of credit to profitable, export-oriented firms.
Imagine a development bank levering up collateral that comprises post-privatization equity retained by the state and other assets (for example, real estate) that could easily be made more valuable (and collateralized) by reforming their property rights.
Imagine that it links the European Investment Bank and the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s €315 billion ($350 billion) investment plan with Greece’s private sector.
Instead of being viewed as a fire sale to fill fiscal holes, privatization would be part of a grand public-private partnership for development.
Imagine further that the “bad bank” helps the financial sector, which was recapitalized generously by strained Greek taxpayers in the midst of the crisis, to shed their legacy of non-performing loans and unclog their financial plumbing.
In concert with the development bank’s virtuous impact, credit and investment flows would flood the Greek economy’s hitherto arid realms, eventually helping the bad bank turn a profit and become “good.”
Finally, imagine the effect of all of this on Greece’s financial, fiscal, and social-security ecosystem: With bank shares skyrocketing, our state’s losses from their recapitalization would be extinguished as its equity in them appreciates.
Meanwhile, the development bank’s dividends would be channeled into the long-suffering pension funds, which were abruptly de-capitalized in 2012 (owing to the “haircut” on their holdings of Greek government bonds).
In this scenario, the task of bolstering social security would be completed with the unification of pension funds; the surge of contributions following the pickup in employment; and the return to formal employment of workers banished into informality by the brutal deregulation of the labor market during the dark years of the recent past.
One can easily imagine Greece recovering strongly as a result of this strategy.
In a world of ultra-low returns, Greece would be seen as a splendid opportunity, sustaining a steady stream of inward foreign direct investment.
But why would this be different from the pre-2008 capital inflows that fueled debt-financed growth?
Could another macroeconomic Ponzi scheme really be avoided?
During the era of Ponzi-style growth, capital flows were channeled by commercial banks into a frenzy of consumption and by the state into an orgy of suspect procurement and outright profligacy.
To ensure that this time is different, Greece will need to reform its social economy and political system.
Creating new bubbles is not our government’s idea of development.
This time, by contrast, the new development bank would take the lead in channeling scarce homegrown resources into selected productive investment.
These include startups, IT companies that use local talent, organic-agro small and medium-size enterprises, export-oriented pharmaceutical companies, efforts to attract the international film industry to Greek locations, and educational programs that take advantage of Greek intellectual output and unrivaled historic sites.
In the meantime, Greece’s regulatory authorities would be keeping a watchful eye over commercial lending practices, while a debt brake would prevent our government from indulging in old, bad habits, ensuring that our state never again slips into primary deficits.
Cartels, anti-competitive invoicing practices, senselessly closed professions, and a bureaucracy that has traditionally turned the state into a public menace would soon discover that our government is their worst foe.
The barriers to growth in the past were an unholy alliance among oligarchic interests and political parties, scandalous procurement, clientelism, the permanently broken media, overly accommodating banks, weak tax authorities, and a weighed-down, fearful judiciary.
Only the bright light of democratic transparency can remove such impediments; our government is determined to help it shine through.
Asia’s View of the Greek Crisis
SEOUL – Asian countries have been watching the Greek crisis unfold with a mixture of envy and schadenfreude.
When they experienced their own financial crisis in 1997, they received far less aid, with far harsher conditions.
But they also recovered much more strongly, suggesting that ever-growing bailouts may not be the best prescription for recovery.
Since the onset of the crisis, Greece has received massive financing from the so-called “troika”: the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
It received bailout packages in 2010 and 2012 totaling €240 billion ($266 billion), including €30 billion from the IMF, more than triple Greece’s cumulative limit for IMF borrowing.
The latest deal promises up to another €86 billion.
By contrast, South Korea’s 1997 bailout package – which was larger than those received by Indonesia, Thailand, or the Philippines – totaled $57 billion, with $21 billion coming from the IMF.
At the time, South Korea’s annual GDP was $560 billion; in 2014, Greek GDP amounted to less than $240 billion.
The IMF seems to have lent Greece such a large amount for political reasons.
For starters, at the onset of the crisis, then-IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a leading candidate to become President of France.
More generally, major IMF shareholders, the European Union, and the United States have a vital interest in stabilizing Greece to safeguard French and German banks and preserve NATO unity.
Desmon Lachman, a former deputy director of the IMF’s policy department, has called the institution a slush fund, abused by its political masters during the Greek crisis.
To be sure, the economic mess created in Greece – the result of government profligacy, official corruption, and widespread tax evasion – merited some international assistance.
And the IMF did impose conditions on its loans to Greece – including fiscal austerity, privatization, and structural reform of its pension and tax systems – most of which were necessary to address the country’s insolvency.
The requirements of the latest rescue deal are the toughest yet – even tougher than those that Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum earlier this month.
But the scale of the aid remains massive, especially when one considers how little progress Greece has made in implementing the reforms it promised in the past.
This contrasts sharply with Asia’s experience in 1997.
Unlike Greece, Asia’s problem was not an insolvency crisis, but a liquidity crisis, caused by a sudden reversal of capital flows.
In South Korea, net private-capital inflows of 4.8% of GDP in 1996 swung to net outflows of 3.4% of GDP in 1997.
Though the accumulation of substantial short-term debts in the financial system and corporate sector did amplify the shocks, the primary factors fueling the crisis were the lack of international liquidity, panicked behavior by investors, and financial contagion.
Yet the IMF imposed even tougher conditions on Asia than it has on Greece, including fiscal austerity, monetary tightening, and financial restructuring.
Some of these requirements were clearly unnecessary, as evidenced by Malaysia, which recovered quickly from the crisis without IMF assistance.
In any case, the actions were temporary.
Once confidence began to recover and market conditions stabilized, the East Asian economies shifted their monetary and fiscal policies toward expansion and embraced large-scale exchange-rate depreciation – efforts that enhanced their export competitiveness.
Structural reforms, including the immediate closing of financial institutions and the elimination of non-performing loans, also helped to bolster recovery.
In South Korea, for example, real GDP growth quickly rebounded from -6.7% in 1998 to 9.5% in 1999.
By mid-2003, some 776 of the country’s financial institutions were closed.
And the authorities’ strong commitment to reform restored investor confidence, reviving inflows of private capital and reactivating foreign trade.
Greece, by contrast, has utterly failed to engineer a recovery.
Instead of dropping to 110% as planned, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased to 170%.
Annual per capita real income contracted 4.8%, on average, over the last six years.
Unemployment stands at 26%, and hovers around 50% among young people.
Against this background, it was not shocking that Greece, unable to come up with €1.5 billion at the end of June, became the first developed country to miss a payment to the IMF.
Belatedly, the Fund acknowledged that its lending and policy advice had failed in Greece.
Greece’s government then demanded more financial support with less stringent conditions.
But, as its creditors have now recognized, providing more money will not address Greece’s insolvency.
That is why the new deal requires that the government immediately cut pensions, hike taxes (beginning with the value-added tax), liberalize the labor market, and adhere to severe spending constraints.
At the same time, a write-down of official debt, like the “haircut” given to private creditors in 2012, will be necessary.
Many have questioned whether agonizing reforms are entirely necessary; if the country returned to the drachma, they suggest, it could implement interest-rate cuts and devalue its exchange rate, thereby engineering an export-led recovery.
But, given Greece’s small export sector, not to mention the weakness of the global economy, such a recovery may be impossible.
Greece’s best bet is reform.
So far, Greece has shown itself to be unwilling to implement a painful internal-wage adjustment and reform measures forced by outsiders.
Perhaps the latest deal, which was reached with Greece on the brink, will prove to be a turning point, with Greece finally committing actively to economic and fiscal reform.
Otherwise, Greece’s exit from the eurozone – with all the concomitant social and economic strife – seems all but inevitable.
Asians watch with sympathy the fall from grace of the birthplace of Western civilization.
But perhaps Greece should look to Asia for proof that, by taking responsibility for its own destiny, a country can emerge stronger from even the most difficult trials.
The Greek Time Bomb
ATHENS – Much is at stake in Greece’s upcoming election.
Indeed, the outcome could determine whether the country remains in the eurozone, with far-reaching implications for the rest of the monetary union.
Syriza, a radical left-wing party whose popularity has skyrocketed amid the country’s economic crisis, is the favorite to win, though it is unlikely to gain enough parliamentary seats to govern alone.
Instead, it will probably lead a coalition government, though with which other parties remains unclear.
Fundamental to Syriza’s platform is its economic program, designed to counteract the impact of the excessively strict austerity that Greeks have endured for the last four and a half years, in exchange for bailouts from the “troika” of the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission.
Pensions have been reduced by 40%, on average, while the middle class is suffering under the weight of crippling new property taxes.
As a result, Greece has fallen into a deep and prolonged recession, with output down 25% from pre-crisis levels.
Worse, unemployment stands at nearly 26% – and more than 50% among young people.
Yet most unemployment benefits are now being eliminated after 12 months, with the long-term unemployed often losing access to the state health-care system.
Add to this a 30% increase in prices for prescription drugs, and it is easy to see why Greek society is unraveling.
Of course, these sacrifices might be worthwhile were they helping Greece reduce its public debt to manageable levels.
But, at the end of 2014, public debt amounted to 175% of GDP, having increased from its 2009 level of 127%.
Servicing that debt would require primary budget surpluses equal to at least 4% of GDP until 2022 – an outcome that would require a surge in growth.
Under the weight of relentless fiscal austerity, however, such growth is out of the question.
That is why Syriza has promised to launch a massive new spending program – including free electricity and food coupons for the poor and an increase in state pensions to pre-crisis levels – that would cost about 6.5% of GDP.
Tax hikes for high-income earners and large property owners would help to finance these expenditures, while increases in the minimum wage would round out income redistribution efforts.
Syriza has also promised to repeal labor-market liberalization and suspend privatization.
Finally, it plans to renegotiate Greece’s debt with lenders, in the hope of writing off the bulk of its liabilities.
Syriza’s economic program neglects the important fact that fiscal consolidation and structural measures not only form part of Greece’s commitments; they also serve the country’s long-term interest.
Given this, they cannot – and should not – be abolished.
Instead, the problems in their design and implementation should be addressed, in order to improve their effectiveness within current economic circumstances.
Such an approach would strengthen Syriza’s position in debt-relief negotiations.
Nonetheless, official statements suggest that the troika would not be inclined to accept Syriza’s negotiating framework, intending instead to complete the talks that it had launched with the outgoing center-right government, the goal being to securing further budget cuts and initiate new labor-market and pension reforms.
In short, the troika will insist that Greece honors its prior commitments.
If negotiations stall, financial and liquidity stress, resulting from Greece’ inability to borrow at current interest rates – ten-year bond yields have reached 9.5 % – will weaken the fiscal position and banking system further.
This could lead to a collapse in confidence, triggering financial upheaval and, in turn, forcing the country to seek a third bailout – one that would require Greece to leave the eurozone and introduce a new, devalued currency.
In that case, Greece’s geopolitical position would be weakened, its economy would sink further into recession, and social tensions would rise.
Moreover, instability would become chronic, because the eurozone would no longer offer a backstop for fiscal and financial laxity.
Eurozone authorities may claim that a Greek exit no longer poses a systemic risk, given the introduction in recent years of various instruments for fighting financial crises, including government-backed rescue funds, a partial banking union, tougher fiscal controls, and the European Central Bank’s new role as lender of last resort.
But a member’s exit would still indicate that the eurozone’s integrity is not guaranteed – a message that the markets are unlikely to miss.
A Greek exit may serve as a warning to countries like Spain, Italy, and France, where strong anti-Europe or anti-establishment parties are on the rise.
But it would do nothing to address the real problem: the increasing economic divergence among eurozone countries.
So long as performance gaps continue to widen, voters will continue to challenge European integration.
Only further unification, underpinned by growth-oriented policies in the struggling countries, can reverse this trend.
Such an outcome is still possible – but only if the relevant actors recognize the risks associated with a Greek exit from the eurozone.
A Syriza-led government must moderate its approach and promise that it will continue to pursue reform and limit spending in exchange for a substantial reduction to its debt burden – a reduction that the troika must be willing to grant.
It is critical to note here that it is not the state as administrator fulfilling this role; rather, it is the entrepreneurial state in action, creating markets, instead of just fixing them.
Green Money
NEW YORK – There is little doubt that green will be the metaphorical color of choice for world leaders when they gather at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh.
Attention will focus on turning the “green shoots” of recovery into sustainable “green growth,” leading to “green economies” consistent with the goal of protecting the world’s climate.
Governments in rich countries are beginning to spell out just what that will mean in terms of policy and lifestyle changes and the investments required to develop clean energy sources.
But, to be successful, a “green new deal” will have to address some enormous challenges in the developing world, where the impact of global warming will be felt first and hardest, and where rapid growth requires massive expansion of cheap energy.
Globally, more than 30 million tons of oil equivalent are consumed in the form of primary energy every day, equivalent to 55 kilowatt hours per person per day, with rich countries, on average, consuming more than twice that figure.
For many developing countries, the figure is well under 20 kwh; China is still well below the global average, and even most emerging markets consume less than one-third of the average in many advanced economies.
The economics behind efforts to close these energy gaps are relatively straightforward.
Up to a threshold of around 100 kwh per capita per day, energy consumption and human development indicators go hand in hand.
At current prices, between $10 and $20 per person per day would be needed to reach that threshold.
This puts energy security well beyond the means of not just the poorest, but also of most people in emerging economies.
Spending $10 per day on energy services would, for example, exhaust the per capita incomes of countries such as Angola, Ecuador, and Macedonia.
Hence, big investments in energy services are the order of the day throughout the developing world.
In order to provide more energy to meet development goals without accelerating global warming, there must be a shift to a new energy infrastructure built around renewables (of which the most significant are probably solar power, wind, and biofuels), cleaner coal, and carbon capture and storage.
The problem is that these are currently much more costly options than their carbon-heavy alternatives.
Policy makers in developing countries are concerned that being forced to go down this path could put modern energy services beyond the reach of poor countries, families, and communities.
Market-based solutions to the climate challenge run the very serious risk of undermining development objectives, precisely because they aim to raise the price of energy services in order to make renewable energy sources attractive to private investors.
Indeed, the protectionist elements tacked on to these proposals make them decidedly anti-development.
So what is needed is massive public investment in cleaner energy provision, coupled in the short term with appropriate subsidies to offset high initial prices.
If targeted at the most promising technology options (say, solar and wind), such a strategy would yield early unit cost write-downs through innovation, learning, and economies of scale; give the private sector clear, credible, and attractive signals; and encourage energy efficiency.
The big obstacle is access to predictable and affordable finance.
The onus is on rich-country governments to support this big push into clean energy in the developing world, as it was their carbon-fueled economic prosperity that has brought us to the brink of a climate catastrophe.
So far, rich countries have not risen to the challenge; despite commitments made at Kyoto, Bali, and elsewhere, the resources committed for climate-change mitigation – let alone adaptation – in developing countries have been paltry and poorly targeted.
The scale of the needed support is comparable to the Marshall Plan, which committed 1% of the United States’ GDP per year to help European reconstruction after World War II.
But, as with the original plan, the long-term returns from such a commitment will be enormous.
This time, moreover, the burden will not fall on one country alone, and a broader mix of traditional and innovative sources of financing are already available to help fund the required investment programs in energy efficiency and renewables.
Even so, scaling-up multilateral support will require a massive overhaul of international finance.
Back in April, G-20 leaders accepted that investing in a low-carbon infrastructure, particularly energy services, is key to a truly sustainable economic and environmental future.
In Pittsburgh, with the clock ticking on talks to adopt a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol this December in Copenhagen, the G-20 will have a real opportunity to show that the color of serious money to meet both climate and development goals really is green.
Green Shoots or Yellow Weeds?
New York – Recent data suggest that the rate of contraction in the world economy may be slowing.
But hopes that “green shoots” of recovery may be springing up have been dashed by plenty of yellow weeds.
Recent data on employment, retail sales, industrial production, and housing in the United States remain very weak; Europe’s first quarter GDP growth data is dismal; Japan’s economy is still comatose; and even China – which is recovering – has very weak exports.
Thus, the consensus view that the global economy will soon bottom out has proven – once again – to be overly optimistic.
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the global financial system nearly melted down and the world economy went into free fall.
Indeed, the rate of economic contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 reached near-depression levels.
At that point, global policymakers got religion and started to use most of the weapons in their arsenal: vast fiscal-policy easing; conventional and unconventional monetary expansion; trillions of dollars in liquidity support, recapitalization, guarantees, and insurance to stem the liquidity and credit crunch; and, finally, massive support to emerging-market economies.
In the last two months alone, one can count more than 150 different policy interventions around the world.
This policy equivalent of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s doctrine of “overwhelming force,” together with the sharp contraction of output below final demand for goods and services (which drew down inventories of unsold goods), sets the stage for most economies to bottom out early next year.
Even so, the optimists who spoke last year of a soft landing or a mild “V-shaped” eight-month recession were proven wrong, while those who argued that this would be a longer and more severe “U-shaped” 24-month recession – the US downturn is already in its 18th month – were correct.
And the recent optimism that economies will bottom out by mid-year have been dashed by the most recent economic data.
The crucial issue, however, is not when the global economy will bottom out, but whether the global recovery – whenever it comes – will be robust or weak over the medium term.
One cannot rule out a couple of quarters of sharp GDP growth as the inventory cycle and the massive policy boost lead to a short-term revival.
But those tentative green shoots that we hear so much about these days may well be overrun by yellow weeds even in the medium term, heralding a weak global recovery over the next two years.
First, employment is still falling sharply in the US and other economies.
Indeed, in advanced economies, the unemployment rate will be above 10% by 2010.
This will be bad news for consumption and the size of bank losses.
Second, this is a crisis of solvency, not just liquidity, but true deleveraging has not really started, because private losses and debts of households, financial institutions, and even corporations are not being reduced, but rather socialized and put on government balance sheets.
Lack of deleveraging will limit the ability of banks to lend, households to spend, and firms to invest.
Third, in countries running current-account deficits, consumers need to cut spending and save much more for many years.
Shopped out, savings-less, and debt-burdened consumers have been hit by a wealth shock (falling home prices and stock markets), rising debt-service ratios, and falling incomes and employment.
Fourth, the financial system – despite the policy backstop – is severely damaged.
Most of the shadow banking system has disappeared, and traditional commercial banks are saddled with trillions of dollars in expected losses on loans and securities while still being seriously undercapitalized.
So the credit crunch will not ease quickly.
Fifth, weak profitability, owing to high debts and default risk, low economic – and thus revenue – growth, and persistent deflationary pressure on companies’ margins, will continue to constrain firms’ willingness to produce, hire workers, and invest.
Sixth, rising government debt ratios will eventually lead to increases in real interest rates that may crowd out private spending and even lead to sovereign refinancing risk.
Seventh, monetization of fiscal deficits is not inflationary in the short run, whereas slack product and labor markets imply massive deflationary forces.
But if central banks don’t find a clear exit strategy from policies that double or triple the monetary base, eventually either goods-price inflation or another dangerous asset and credit bubble (or both) will ensue.
Some recent rises in the prices of equities, commodities, and other risky assets is clearly liquidity-driven.
Eighth, some emerging-market economies with weaker economic fundamentals may not be able to avoid a severe financial crisis, despite massive IMF support.
Finally, the reduction of global imbalances implies that the current-account deficits of profligate economies (the US and other Anglo-Saxon countries) will narrow the current-account surpluses of over-saving countries (China and other emerging markets, Germany, and Japan).
But if domestic demand does not grow fast enough in surplus countries, the resulting lack of global demand relative to supply – or, equivalently, the excess of global savings relative to investment spending – will lead to a weaker recovery in global growth, with most economies growing far more slowly than their potential.
So, green shoots of stabilization may be replaced by yellow weeds of stagnation if several medium-term factors constrain the global economy’s ability to return to sustained growth.
Unless these structural weaknesses are resolved, the global economy may grow in 2010-2011, but at an anemic rate.
Greenspan Hypnotizes Himself
On the eve of the last G-7 meeting in London, US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did a startling about-face by soft-pedaling America’s trade deficit.
“Market pressures …appear poised to stabilize and over the longer run possibly to decrease the US current-account deficit and its attendant financing requirements,” he said.
But just two months earlier, in Frankfurt, Mr. Greenspan had cautioned that the US deficit could not go on forever without the dollar depreciating. What is going on here?
To be sure, the US trade figures have improved somewhat.
The expected December trade deficit is $57 billion—an improvement on the record $60.3 billion gap in November.
And the November figure will be adjusted downward because of a recently discovered statistical error by Canadian authorities.
But politics, not economics, explains why the Fed chairman changed his tune about America’s weak external position.
Mr. Greenspan’s statement in Frankfurt in November alarmed senior European Central Bank (ECB) officials, who considered it a “provocation” – one that promptly sent the dollar into an unwanted tailspin.
The last thing the Fed Maestro needed was a repeat performance on the eve of the G-7 – a meeting that is supposed to exemplify international co-operation.
So Mr. Greenspan decided to extend a peace offering to the Europeans.
Politics also explains Mr. Greenspan’s pre-G-7 comment that “the voice of fiscal restraint, barely audible a year ago, has at least partially regained volume.”
The Fed chairman is “hearing voices” because he is a team player who wants to encourage US budget cutting.
How would it look if he had openly expressed misgivings about Bush’s plan to cut the budget deficit in half by 2009 just days before it was made public?
What Mr. Greenspan chose to overlook, however, is that most experts are extremely – and rightly – skeptical of the Bush plan, which leaves out big-ticket items such as the cost of the Iraq War, and uses an unrealistic benchmark from which to measure the alleged 50% cutback.
Timing the budget’s release for just after the G-7 made for a harmonious London meeting in which both Americans and Europeans could claim that the US was taking care of business—that is, its twin fiscal and current-account deficits.
The Europeans gladly went along with this charade because they now fear dollar depreciation more than global imbalance.
So far, Europe’s fragile economic recovery has been based largely on exports.
The euro’s rapid appreciation against the dollar threatens to undermine this foundation.
But internal European Union studies indicate that European exports are more closely linked to changes in external demand than the euro-dollar exchange rate.
So long as external demand holds up – and recent growth numbers from China and the US are positive in this regard – Europe’s exports should continue to perform well.
In any case, protecting exports by resisting euro appreciation – or, more precisely, dollar depreciation – is a poor way to promote economic growth.
A strong currency keeps both inflation and ECB interest hikes at bay. This helps boost private consumption and investment.
Moreover, because crude oil is priced in US dollars, a rise in the euro means a fall in energy costs.
This, too, helps European growth.
Over the longer term, a strong currency promotes efficiency in export industries, further insulating competitiveness from exchange-rate effects. Dollar depreciation improves Europe’s terms of trade and real income.
America’s fiscal and external deficits will not disappear just because the chief magician at the Federal Reserve waves his wand and says abracadabra.
On the contrary, the longer Greenspan plays down America’s dangerous macroeconomic imbalances with happy talk, the more damage they will ultimately inflict on the global economy.
What the world needs now is the realist Greenspan of Frankfurt, not the cheerleader Greenspan of London.
Simply put, there must be dollar depreciation to keep global imbalances in check.
Instead of catering to European fears and prejudices about exchange rates, the Fed chairman should put politics aside and stick to sound economics.
The Costs of Grexit
PARIS – Earlier this week, following days of tense discussions, the new government in Athens reached an agreement with its eurozone creditors that includes a package of immediate reforms and a four-month extension of the financial assistance program.
But, despite Europe's collective sigh of relief, the compromise does not preclude the need for further tough negotiations on a new financial-assistance program that should be introduced by the end of June.
In any negotiation, a key variable influencing the protagonists' behavior, hence the outcome, is what failure to reach an agreement would cost each of them.
In this case, the issue is the cost of Greece's exit (“Grexit") from the eurozone – a prospect that was widely discussed in the media throughout the recent negotiation, with considerable speculation about the stance of the various players, especially the Greek and German governments.
From Greece's perspective, leaving the euro would be highly disruptive, which explains why there is very little support for it in the country.
But what about Grexit costs for the rest of the eurozone?
Ever since the question was first raised in 2011-2012, there have been two opposing views.
One view – dubbed the domino theory – claims that if Greece exited, markets would immediately start wondering who is next.
Other countries' fate would be called into question, as occurred during the Asian currency crises of 1997-98 or the European sovereign-debt crisis of 2010-2012.
Disintegration of the eurozone could follow.
The other view – often dubbed the ballast theory – claims that the eurozone would actually be strengthened by Greece's withdrawal.
The monetary union would be rid of a recurring problem, and a eurozone decision to allow or invite Greece to leave would bolster the credibility of its rules.
No country, it is claimed, could dare to blackmail its partners anymore.
Back in 2012, the domino theory looked realistic enough that the creditor countries ditched the Grexit option.
Having reflected and pondered over the summer, German Chancellor Angela Merkel went to Athens and expressed her “hopes and wishes" that Greece remains in.
But the situation today is different.
Market tension has eased considerably; Ireland and Portugal are not under assistance programs anymore; the eurozone financial system has been strengthened by the decision to move to a banking union; and crisis-management instruments are in place.
A Grexit-induced chain reaction would be significantly less likely.
But it does not follow that the loss would be harmless.
There are three reasons why Grexit could still seriously weaken Europe's monetary union.
First and foremost, a Greek exit would disprove the tacit assumption that participation in the euro is irrevocable.
True, history teaches that no commitment is irrevocable: according to Jens Nordvig of Nomura Securities, there have been 67 currency-union breakups since the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Any exit from the eurozone would increase the perceived probability that other countries may, sooner or later, follow suit.
Second, an exit would vindicate those who do consider the euro merely a beefed-up fixed-exchange-rate arrangement, not a true currency.
Confidence in the US dollar relies on the fact that there is no difference between a dollar held in a bank in Boston and one held in San Francisco.
But since the 2010-2012 crisis, this is not entirely true of the euro anymore.
Financial fragmentation has receded but not disappeared, meaning that a loan to a company in Austria does not carry exactly the same interest rate as a loan to the same company on the other side of the Italian border.
Critics like the German economist Hans-Werner Sinn have made a specialty of tracking exposure to the break-up risk.
None of this is currently lethal, owing to the initiatives taken in recent years; but it would be a mistake to assume that full confidence has been restored.
European citizens would certainly respond to a country's withdrawal (or expulsion) from the eurozone by starting to look at the currency in a different way.
Where a euro is held would become a relevant question.
Domestic and foreign investors would scrutinize more closely whether an asset's value would be affected by a breakup of the monetary union.
Governments would become more suspicious of the risks to which their partners potentially expose them.
Indeed, suspicion would become irreversible, and it would replace the belief in the irreversibility of the eurozone.
Finally, an exit would force European policymakers to formalize their so-far unwritten and even unspecified rules for divorce.
Beyond broad principles of international law – for example, that what matters for deciding an asset's post-divorce currency denomination are the law governing the underlying contract and the corresponding jurisdiction – there are no agreed rules for deciding how conversion into a new currency would be carried out.
A Grexit would force these rules to be defined, therefore making it clear what a euro is worth, depending on where it is held, by whom, and in what form.
Indeed this would not only make the break-up risk more imaginable; it would also make it much more concrete.
None of this means that eurozone members should be ready to pay whatever cost is needed to keep Greece inside the eurozone.
This would obviously amount to a surrender.
But they should not harbor any illusions, either: there can be no such thing as a happy Grexit.
Grit is Good
PARIS – The United States is widely recognized as possessing the deepest, most liquid, and most efficient capital markets in the world. America’s financial system supports efficient capital allocation, economic development, and job creation.
These and similar phrases have been common currency among American legislators, regulators, and financial firms for decades.
Even in the wake of the financial crisis that erupted in 2008, they trip off the word processors of a hundred submissions challenging the so-called Volcker rule (which would bar banks from making proprietary investments). The casual reader nods and moves along.
But there are signs that these assumptions are now being challenged.
Prior to the crisis, regulatory authorities focused mainly on removing barriers to trading, and generally favored measures that made markets more complete by fostering faster, cheaper trading of a wider variety of financial claims. That is no longer the case.
On the contrary, nowadays many are questioning the assumption that greater market efficiency is always and everywhere a public good.
Might such ease and efficiency not also fuel market instability, and serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their clients?
Phrases like “sand in the machine” and “grit in the oyster,” which were pejorative in the prelapsarian days of 2006, are now used to support regulatory or fiscal changes that may slow down trading and reduce its volume.
For example, the proposed Financial Transactions Tax in the European Union implies a wide-ranging impost generating more than €50 billion a year to shore up the EU’s own finances and save the euro. The fact that 60-70% of the receipts would come from London is an added attraction for its continental advocates.
Opponents argue, in pre-crisis language, that the FTT would reduce market efficiency and displace trading to other locations. “So what?” supporters reply: maybe much of the trading is “socially useless,” and we would be better off without it.
The Volcker rule (named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker) provoked similar arguments.
Critics have complained that it would reduce liquidity in important markets, such as those for non-US sovereign debt.
Defending his creation, Volcker harks back to a simpler time for the financial system, and refers to “overly liquid, speculation-prone securities markets.”
His message is clear: he is not concerned about lower trading volumes.
There is more grit on the horizon.
In a penetrating analysis of the “Flash Crash” of May 6, 2010, when the Dow lost $1 trillion of market value in 30 minutes, Andy Haldane of the Bank of England argues that while rising equity-market capitalization might well be associated with financial development and economic growth, there is no such relationship between market turnover and growth.
Turnover in US financial markets rose four-fold in the decade before the crisis.
Did the real economy benefit?
Haldane cites a striking statistic: in 1945, the average investor held the average US share for four years. By 2000, the average holding period had fallen to eight months; by 2008, it was two months.
There appears to be a link between this precipitous drop in the average duration of stock holdings and the phenomenon of the so-called “ownerless corporation,” whereby shareholders have little incentive to impose discipline on management.
That absence of accountability, in turn, has contributed to the vertiginous rise in senior executives’ compensation and, in financial firms, to a shift away from shareholder returns and towards large payouts to insiders.
But Haldane’s main concern is with the stability of markets, particularly the threats posed by high-frequency trading (HFT).
He points out that HFT already accounts for half of total turnover in some debt and foreign-exchange markets, and that it is dominant in US equity markets, accounting for more than one-third of daily trading, up from less than one-fifth in 2005.
The rapid, dramatic shifts brought about by HFT are likely to continue.
It is only a decade since trading speeds fell below one second; they are now as fast as the blink of an eye. Technological change promises even faster trading speeds in the near future.
Indeed, HFT firms talk of a “race to zero,” the point at which trading takes place at close to the speed of light.
Should we welcome this trend? Will light-speed trading deliver us to free-market Nirvana?
The evidence is mixed. It would seem that bid-offer spreads are falling, which we might regard as positive.
But volatility has risen, as has cross-market contagion. Instability in one market carries over into others.
As for liquidity, while on the surface it looks deeper, the joint report on the Flash Crash prepared by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that HFT traders scaled back liquidity sharply, thereby exacerbating the problem.
The liquidity that they apparently offer proved unreliable under stress – that is, when it is most needed.
There are lessons here for regulators. First, their monitoring of markets requires a quantum leap in sophistication and speed.
There is a case, too, for looking again at the operation of circuit-breakers (which helped the Chicago markets in the crash), and for increasing the obligations on market makers.
Such steps must be carefully calibrated, as greater obligations, for example, could push market makers out of the market.
But Haldane’s conclusion is that, overall, markets are less stable as a result of the sharp rise in turnover, and that “grit in the wheels, like grit on the roads, could help forestall the next crash.”
So the traditional defense of US and, indeed, European capital markets is not as axiomatic as it once seemed.
Market participants need to engage more effectively with the new agenda, and not assume that claims of greater “market efficiency” will win the day.
Without more sophisticated arguments, they might well find themselves submerged under a pile of regulatory sandbags.
Grounding Syria’s Killers
NEW YORK – As Syria has descended into all-out civil war, much of the worsening slaughter has been attributable to aerial bombardments of urban neighborhoods that President Bashar al-Assad’s opponents control, with such attacks causing especially high casualties in recent weeks in the ancient city of Aleppo.
Can anything be done to stop the killing?
There are many good reasons not to intervene militarily.
For one thing, it would be impossible to do so under the auspices of the United Nations, owing to Russian and Chinese obstructionism in the Security Council.
There is also America’s understandable reluctance to become involved in yet another war in an Islamic country, as well as the impossibility of knowing what kind of regime might emerge if and when Assad is overthrown.
Yet it also seems impossible to stand by while the daily bloodbath continues.
The situation in Syria feels more and more like what we witnessed in Bosnia 20 years ago.
Then, as now, the international community’s main response for an extended period was to provide humanitarian assistance to the conflict’s growing number of victims.
Thanks to satellite television, the world had a front-row seat to watch the citizens of Sarajevo, who were kept alive by UN food deliveries, being killed by shelling and sniping from the surrounding hills.
Today, the UN is delivering an increasing amount of assistance to Syrian refugees who have managed to escape to neighboring countries, while those who have not are being slaughtered.
As with Syria now, Russian support for the Serbian side two decades ago was one of the factors that prevented military intervention.
But it was by no means the only obstacle.
The US presidential election in 1992 made George H. W. Bush’s administration reluctant to use military force.
Other political factors deterred Britain and France – and Bush’s successor, Bill Clinton – from intervening until another three years of killing had taken place.
While military intervention in Syria may be impossible, imposing a no-fly zone is not.
To be sure, a no-fly zone over Syria would not be a simple undertaking: substantial resources would be required, and, given the regime’s military capabilities, it would not be a risk-free operation.
Yet it was accomplished for more than a decade in neighboring Iraq to keep Saddam Hussein from attacking segments of his own population, so we know that it can be done in Syria as well.
Of course, someone – presumably Gulf States such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia – is supplying the Syrian opposition with weapons.
Yet, as long as Assad’s forces can attack opposition-controlled neighborhoods with helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes, the opposition’s ability to overthrow the regime with the arms that are now available to it seems questionable.
What is more certain is that the presence of armed fighters in a neighborhood provokes aerial attacks that destroy civilian infrastructure and maim and kill those residents who have not fled.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan made a valiant effort to negotiate a peace settlement when there still seemed to be a remote chance of success.
Since then, the sharp rise in bloodshed has made it increasingly unlikely, or even impossible, that Assad’s opponents would consent to any arrangement that kept him in power.
At the same time, Assad’s loyalists, especially members of the minority Alawite sect, must fear that they would be massacred if his regime fell.
At some point, the international community may have to intervene to prevent or mitigate such a massacre.
Its credibility in doing so, and therefore its likelihood of success, would be far greater if it were to intervene now to establish a no-fly zone to protect civilians in the opposition neighborhoods of Syria’s cities.
Because Russian and Chinese intransigence precludes the UN from establishing a no-fly zone, the Arab League and NATO should jointly take the lead.
And, while the participation of the US, which has by far the greatest logistical capacity, is essential, it should not be in the forefront.
As in the case of Libya, this would be an excellent opportunity to “lead from behind.”
A no-fly zone is by no means a solution to the conflict in Syria.
But it would be a modest step in the direction of reducing the great harm currently being done.
A more comprehensive approach, if one could be found, would be far preferable.
Until then, it seems well worth pursuing efforts that would help to abate the carnage.
Growing Up in the Eurozone
MILAN – A rapid and large increase of government debt has been a general phenomenon in the advanced countries since the 2007-09 crisis: for the first time, the average debt/GDP ratio for OECD countries has surpassed 100%.
Fiscal consolidation will weigh on growth prospects for two generations to come, and the welfare state as we have known it in Europe since World War II will have to be transformed, especially given a rapidly aging population.
But the eurozone debt crisis has distinctive features.
Most importantly, while the average debt/GDP ratio is no higher than it is in other advanced countries, and consolidation efforts started earlier, the eurozone has been mired in a severe crisis of confidence for the past two years.
This points to a systemic dimension of the crisis that cannot be reduced to profligate behavior by fiscal sinners.
Indeed, the Greek crisis exposed three main flaws in the monetary union itself.
First, the system lacked effective arrangements to align fiscal and other economic policies.
As long as enforcement of fiscal discipline is entrusted to an intergovernmental body, the problem is bound to reappear, limiting the credibility of common budgetary rules.
Moreover, financial markets underpriced private and sovereign credit risks, in the implicit belief that no one would fail, and that all debts would somehow be made whole, implying weak market discipline on borrowers.
Finally, once the crisis hit, leading to a re-pricing of risks in financial markets, the need to avoid an economic and financial meltdown compelled governments to support aggregate demand and make private liabilities whole.
But the disconnection between centralized monetary and decentralized fiscal powers de facto impeded the full use of monetary instruments to meet monetary and financial shocks.
That left individual eurozone members exposed to brutal pressure by financial markets at a time when excessive private debt was turned into unsustainable public debt.
Suddenly, the eurozone had become a straightjacket.
And so it has remained: budgets are cut, growth falters, and periphery countries must engineer substantial real exchange-rate devaluations to regain competitiveness and close their external deficits.
Core countries, meanwhile, argue that they can do little to strengthen aggregate demand and relieve pressure on their partners, even as the periphery’s agony is dragging the core into recession, owing to its dependence on peripheral export markets.
And, indeed, recent data point to a rapidly worsening economic environment in Germany, where the trade surplus has shrunk dramatically in recent months.
Over the past two years, fundamental changes in the eurozone’s economic governance have aimed at rectifying the monetary union’s founding flaws.
And, along the way, an intergovernmental process has become communitarian.
Key powers over the implementation of common policy guidelines have been entrusted to the European Commission, and the European Council has limited its own ability to reject Commission recommendations by requiring a qualified majority to change them.
Strong economic-governance rules, however, will not suffice.
A fully functioning monetary union also requires a central bank that is free to act as required to confront liquidity and confidence shocks, some mutualization of government debts, and centralized control over fiscal policy.
Moreover, it must have centralized banking supervisory policies, with strong powers to manage bank crises and to liquidate banks that cannot be rescued.
All of this can be achieved only gradually, as Europe moves to a fully-fledged federal union.
Whether the eurozone will survive in the meantime will be determined by the European Council’s capacity to establish intermediate arrangements that can halt the crisis and restore trust among its members.
At their meeting at the end of June, European leaders acknowledged for the first time the multiple dimensions of the crisis, accepting that austerity – putting everyone’s house in order – will not suffice.
Accordingly, new joint policy initiatives will address economic growth, banking union, and liquidity.
Moreover, European leaders have placed these new policies within a coherent longer-term framework that may also include “the issuance of common debt.”
Likewise, the European Council has agreed on a new “Compact for growth and jobs” that identifies a specific European dimension of growth policies, mainly integration of energy, transport, communications, and services, together with higher infrastructure investment.
What is notably missing is recognition of the need for greater flexibility on fiscal-consolidation efforts.
As the Commission has requested, countries with stronger fiscal positions should consider slowing their consolidation efforts in order to avoid aggravating the recession.
But, in order to preserve investors’ confidence, some eurozone countries must strike a difficult balance between austerity and overkill, which would have been facilitated had the European Council issued a clear statement that letting automatic stabilizers work, while remaining on track with structural budget targets, fully complies with European Union obligations.
Moreover, a greater share of the adjustment burden must fall on Germany.
Recent fairly generous wage agreements in Germany will help, but are not enough; there is also a need to boost domestic demand.
More aggressive liberalization of the bloated banking system, network services (especially in energy and transport), and public procurement may contribute significantly over time to raising domestic investment and incomes.
The sizeable investments required to make up for the loss of nuclear energy may contribute more immediate stimulus.
All of this should not be seen as a concession, but as part of the obligations undertaken by eurozone governments to address excessive imbalances.
Now more than ever, Germany must be persuaded that without its contribution in reviving growth and correcting external imbalances, the eurozone faces prolonged depression and certain collapse.
Long Live China’s Boom
BEIJING – After three decades of 9.8% average annual GDP growth, China’s economic expansion has been slowing for 13 consecutive quarters – the first such extended period of deceleration since the “reform and opening up” policy was launched in 1979.
Real GDP grew at an annual rate of only 7.5% in the second quarter of this year (equal to the target actually set by the Chinese government at the beginning of this year).
Many indicators point to further economic deceleration, and there is a growing bearishness among investors about the outlook for China.
Will China crash?
In fact, many other rapidly growing emerging economies have suffered – and worse than China – from the drop in global demand resulting from ongoing retrenchment in high-income economies since the 2008 financial crisis.
For example, GDP growth in Brazil has slowed sharply, from 7.5% in 2010 to 2.7% in 2011 and to just 0.9% in 2012, while India’s growth rate slowed from 10.5% to 3.2% over the same period.
Moreover, many high-income newly industrialized economies (NIEs) with few structural problems were not spared the effects of the 2008 crisis.
South Korea’s GDP growth slowed from 6.3% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2011 and to 2% in 2012; Taiwan’s fell from 10.7% to 1.3% over this period; and Singapore’s plummeted from 14.8% to 1.3%.
Given this, China’s economic slowdown since the first quarter of 2010 has apparently been caused mainly by external and cyclical factors.
Facing an external shock, the Chinese government should and can maintain a 7.5% growth rate by taking counter-cyclical and proactive fiscal-policy measures, while maintaining a prudent monetary policy.
After all, China has high private and public savings, foreign reserves exceeding $3.3 trillion, and great potential for industrial upgrading and infrastructure improvement.
Indeed, China can maintain an 8% annual GDP growth rate for many years to come, because modern economic growth is a process of continuous technological innovation and industrial upgrading.
Of course, this is true for developed and developing countries alike.
But developed countries differ from developing countries in an important way. Since the Industrial Revolution, developed countries have always been on the global frontier of technologies and industries, which has required them to invest in costly and risky indigenous research and development.
By contrast, technologies and existing industries in developing countries are in general well within the global frontier.
As a result, they benefit from the “latecomer’s advantage”: technological innovation and industrial upgrading can be achieved by imitation, import, and/or integration of existing technologies and industries, all of which implies much lower R&D costs.
In theory, any developing country that can harness its latecomer’s advantage to achieve technological and industrial upgrading can grow faster than developed countries.
How much faster is an empirical question.
According to the Growth Commission led by Nobel laureate Michael Spence, 13 economies took full advantage of their latecomer status after World War II and achieved annual GDP growth rates of 7% or higher – at least twice as high as developed countries’ growth rates – for 25 years or longer.
China became one of the 13 economies after 1979.
Because the country’s latecomer status explains its 33 years of rapid economic growth, the key to understanding its potential for further rapid growth in the future lies in estimating how large those advantages still are.
Per capita GDP, which reflects a country’s average labor productivity and its overall technological and industrial achievement, is a useful proxy to estimate latecomer’s advantage.
That is, the per capita GDP gap between China and developed countries essentially reflects the gap between them in terms of overall technological and industrial achievement.
According to the most up-to-date estimate by the late economic historian Angus Maddison, China’s per capita GDP in 2008 was $6,725 in 1990 dollars, which was 21% of per capita GDP in the United States.
That is roughly the same gap that existed between the US and Japan in 1951, Singapore in 1967, Taiwan in 1975, and South Korea in 1977 – four economies that are also among the 13 successful economies studied by the Growth Commission.
Harnessing their latecomer’s advantage, Japan’s average annual growth rate soared to 9.2% over the subsequent 20 years, compared to 8.6% in Singapore, 8.3% in Taiwan, and 7.6% in South Korea.
If the latecomer’s advantage implied by the income gap between the four NIEs and the US enabled the NIEs to realize average annual GDP growth rates of 7.6%-9.2% for 20 years, China’s annual growth potential should be a similar 8% for the 2008-2028 period.
To realize its potential growth as a latecomer, China needs, above all, to deepen its market-oriented reforms, address various structural problems, and develop its economy according to its comparative advantages.
Globalization’s Last Gasp
LONDON – Does Donald Trump’s election as United States president mean that globalization is dead, or are reports of the process’ demise greatly exaggerated?
If globalization is only partly incapacitated, not terminally ill, should we worry?
How much will slower trade growth, now in the offing, matter for the global economy?
World trade growth would be slowing down, even without Trump in office.
Its growth was already flat in the first quarter of 2016, and it fell by nearly 1% in the second quarter.
This continues a prior trend: since 2010, global trade has grown at an annual rate of barely 2%.
Together with the fact that worldwide production of goods and services has been rising by more than 3%, this means that the trade-to-GDP ratio has been falling, in contrast to its steady upward march in earlier years.
This disturbing trajectory, argue the mavens of globalization, reflects the resurgent protectionism manifest in popular opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and now in Trump’s electoral victory.
It means that the benefits of openness and specialization are being squandered.
Causality in economics may be elusive, but in this case it is clear.
So far, slower trade growth has been the result of slower GDP growth, not the other way around.
This is particularly evident in the case of investment spending, which has fallen sharply since the global financial crisis.
Investment spending is trade-intensive, because countries rely disproportionately on a relatively small handful of producers, like Germany, for technologically sophisticated capital goods.
In addition, slower trade growth reflects China’s economic deceleration.
Until 2011 China was growing at double-digit rates, and Chinese exports and imports were growing even faster.
China’s growth has now slowed by a third, leading to slower growth of Chinese trade.
China’s growth miracle, benefiting a fifth of the earth’s population, is the most important economic event of the last quarter-century.
But it can happen only once.
And now that the phase of catch-up growth is over for China, this engine of global trade will slow.
The other engine of world trade has been global supply chains.
Trade in parts and components has benefited from falling transport costs, reflecting containerization and related advances in logistics.
But efficiency in shipping is unlikely to continue to improve faster than efficiency in the production of what is being shipped.
Already, motor-vehicle manufacturers ship an automotive transmission back and forth across the US-Mexican border several times in the course of production.
At some point, unpacking that production process still further will reach the point of diminishing returns.
So should we worry that trade is growing more slowly?
Yes, but only in the sense that a doctor worries when a patient runs a fever.
Fever is rarely life-threatening; rather, it is a symptom of an underlying condition.
In this case, the condition is slow economic growth, also known as secular stagnation, caused by depressed investment, which in turn reflects financial problems and policy uncertainty.
This, then, is the underlying condition.
Trade agreements like the TPP and TTIP address it only obliquely.
Increased spending on infrastructure by governments, to boost investment and growth directly, is more to the point.
But whether the Trump administration and the new US Congress can design and implement a program of productive infrastructure spending remains to be seen.
More generally, a political consensus is needed on growth-promoting policies, so that investment is not held hostage to political infighting.
Whether this will be possible under Trump’s administration is another open question.
The story for cross-border flows of financial capital is even more dramatic.
Gross capital flows – the sum of inflows and outflows – are not just growing more slowly; they are down significantly in absolute terms from 2009 levels.
But dramatic is not the same as alarming.
In fact, it is mainly cross-border bank lending and borrowing that have fallen.
Foreign direct investment – financial flows to build foreign factories and acquire foreign companies – remains at pre-crisis levels.
So do cross-border borrowing and lending through stock and bond markets.
This difference reflects regulation.
Having concluded, rightly, that cross-border bank lending is especially risky, regulators clamped down on banks’ international operations.
In response, many banks curtailed their cross-border business.
But, rather than alarming anyone, this should be seen as reassuring, because the riskiest forms of international finance have been curtailed without disrupting more stable and productive forms of foreign investment.
We now face the prospect of the US government revoking the Dodd-Frank Act and rolling back the financial reforms of recent years.
Less stringent financial regulation may underpin a recovery in international capital flows.
But we should be careful what we wish for.
Growth in a Buddhist Economy
NEW YORK – I have just returned from Bhutan, the Himalayan kingdom of unmatched natural beauty, cultural richness, and inspiring self-reflection.
From the kingdom’s uniqueness now arises a set of economic and social questions that are of pressing interest for the entire world.
Bhutan’s rugged geography fostered the rise of a hardy population of farmers and herdsmen, and helped to foster a strong Buddhist culture, closely connected in history with Tibet.
The population is sparse – roughly 700,000 people on territory the size of France – with agricultural communities nestled in deep valleys and a few herdsmen in the high mountains.
Each valley is guarded by a dzong (fortress), which includes monasteries and temples, all dating back centuries and exhibiting a masterful combination of sophisticated architecture and fine arts.
Bhutan’s economy of agriculture and monastic life remained self-sufficient, poor, and isolated until recent decades, when a series of remarkable monarchs began to guide the country toward technological modernization (roads, power, modern health care, and education), international trade (notably with neighboring India), and political democracy.  What is incredible is the thoughtfulness with which Bhutan is approaching this process of change, and how Buddhist thinking guides that thoughtfulness.
Bhutan is asking itself the question that everyone must ask: how can economic modernization be combined with cultural robustness and social well-being?
In Bhutan, the economic challenge is not growth in gross national product, but in gross national happiness (GNH).
I went to Bhutan to understand better how GNH is being applied.
There is no formula, but, befitting the seriousness of the challenge and Bhutan’s deep tradition of Buddhist reflection, there is an active and important process of national deliberation.
Therein lies the inspiration for all of us.
Part of Bhutan’s GNH revolves, of course, around meeting basic needs – improved health care, reduced maternal and child mortality, greater educational attainment, and better infrastructure, especially electricity, water, and sanitation.
This focus on material improvement aimed at meeting basic needs makes sense for a country at Bhutan’s relatively low income level.
Yet GNH goes well beyond broad-based, pro-poor growth.
Bhutan is also asking how economic growth can be combined with environmental sustainability – a question that it has answered in part through a massive effort to protect the country’s vast forest cover and its unique biodiversity.
It is asking how it can preserve its traditional equality and foster its unique cultural heritage. And it is asking how individuals can maintain their psychological stability in an era of rapid change, marked by urbanization and an onslaught of global communication in a society that had no televisions until a decade ago.
I came to Bhutan after hearing an inspiring speech by Prime Minister Jigme Thinley at the 2010 Delhi Summit on Sustainable Development. Thinley had made two compelling points.
The first concerned the environmental devastation that he could observe – including the retreat of glaciers and the loss of land cover – as he flew from Bhutan to India. The second was about the individual and the meaning of happiness.
Thinley put it simply: We are each finite and fragile physical beings. How much “stuff” – fast foods, TV commercials, large cars, new gadgets, and latest fashions – can we stuff into ourselves without deranging our own psychological well-being?
For the world’s poorest countries, such questions are not the most pressing.
Their biggest and most compelling challenge is to meet citizens’ basic needs.
But, for more and more countries, Thinley’s reflection on the ultimate sources of well-being is not only timely, but urgent.
Everybody knows how American-style hyper-consumerism can destabilize social relations and lead to aggressiveness, loneliness, greed, and over-work to the point of exhaustion.
What is perhaps less recognized is how those trends have accelerated in the United States itself in recent decades.
This may be the result of, among other things, the increasing and now relentless onslaught of advertising and public relations.
The question of how to guide an economy to produce sustainable happiness – combining material well-being with human health, environmental conservation, and psychological and cultural resiliency – is one that needs addressing everywhere.
Bhutan has many things going its way.
It will be able to increase exports of clean, run-of-the-river hydropower to India, thereby earning foreign exchange in a manner that is sustainable and that can fill government coffers to fund education, health care, and infrastructure.
The country is also intent on ensuring that the benefits of growth reach all of the population, regardless of region or income level.
There are serious risks.
Global climate change threatens Bhutan’s ecology and economy.
Incautious and expensive advice from McKinsey and other private consulting firms could help turn Bhutan into a degraded tourist zone.
One must hope that the quest for GNH will help steer the country away from such temptations.
The key for Bhutan is to regard GNH as an enduring quest, rather than as a simple checklist.
Bhutan’s Buddhist tradition understands happiness not as attachment to goods and services, but as the result of the serious work of inner reflection and compassion toward others.
Bhutan has embarked on such a serious journey. The rest of the world’s economies should do the same.
Grumpy Old Men
LONDON – Having reached pensionable age, I qualify to be a grumpy old man.
I should be boring my children, and the students at Oxford University where I am Chancellor, with grumbles about how everything is going to the dogs.
But that is not quite how I see things.
I went to university myself in 1962. My first term coincided with the Cuban missile crisis.
The world seemed to be teetering on the brink of nuclear catastrophe.
Those were the days when global peace was sustained by a concept known suitably enough by the acronym MAD – Mutually Assured Destruction.
Was that world a worse and more dangerous one than today, where our main nuclear concerns are how to prevent proliferation and strengthen the treaty that has deterred it for the last generation?
At the end of my years at Oxford, I went as a student to the United States and visited Alabama.
You may recall the story of Richard Nixon attending the independence celebrations in Ghana.
At a gala reception, he went up to one guest, mistaking him for a local, and asked what it felt like to be able to vote and enjoy freedom under the rule of law.
“I wouldn’t know,” the man replied, “I’m from Alabama.”
Within my adult lifetime, we have moved from the murder of civil-rights campaigners in the US to the election of a black president.
Nothing to be grumpy about there.
Elsewhere, some of our biggest problems have a sort of Hegelian quality. They are the result of solving past problems or of past success.
Consider, for example, the biggest challenge facing us, which deserves to be called existential: global warming and climate change.
In the last century, the world got richer; its population quadrupled; the number of people living in cities grew thirteen-fold; and we consumed more of everything.
Water consumption rose nine-fold and energy use thirteen-fold.
Industrial output soared to 40 times its level at the beginning of the twentieth century.
But – and here comes the real hit – carbon-dioxide emissions grew seventeen-fold.
That is the biggest problem we face – the unforeseen result of increased economic activity and prosperity.
Looking at preparations for the Copenhagen summit in December, when we will try to broker a new global agreement to combat climate change, does not make me grumpy.
At last, the big players are taking the issues seriously.
The US is no longer in denial on the question.
President Barack Obama and his advisers do not deny the scientific evidence of what is happening to us all.
In China, political leaders seem genuine in their commitment to reduce the carbon content of their runaway economy.
The big problems, of course, are how we take account of past responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere, how we balance aggregate national emissions and per capita figures – China leads in the first category; the US, Australia, and Canada are the biggest culprits in the second – and how we manage technology transfer from developed to emerging and poor economies.
There will be plenty to moan about if we don’t solve these problems sooner rather than later.
This is where old men seem past their political expiration dates.
Let me explain. For all of our lives, my generation has defined success in terms of rising GDP growth: more money in more pockets, more resources for public programs, and more jobs.
None of these will necessarily be a measure of future success.
We need to talk more about the quality of growth.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has raised this issue, and he is right to do so.
Try telling that to the poor. But what we should want to promote is the right sort of growth – growth that won’t ravage our future prospects.
We have to define the sustainability of growth in ways that create an attractive narrative for our citizens.
At the moment, people applaud sustainable growth, but they don’t vote for what it means in practice.
German voters balk at any suggestion that we should limit the environmental damage caused by big and expensive cars. British voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol, not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes.
Ideas for carbon taxes run into resistance everywhere.
I have five grandchildren below the age of four.
By the time they qualify for pensions and the license to grumble, the century will be into its seventh or eighth decade.
We hope!
How much will they have to get angry about then because of the way that we are behaving today?
Guilty Democrats
LONDON – When former Czech President Václav Havel knocked on the door of the Chinese embassy in Prague to demand the release of the writer Liu Xiaobo, I had an eerie sense of déjà vu.
Thirty-three years ago, Havel helped initiate Charter 77, the landmark document that crystallized the ideals of all the dissidents – and many others – trapped behind the Iron Curtain.
Havel , of course, was rewarded with a long jail sentence for his efforts.
Now Liu has been sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for much the same crime: initiating Charter 08, perhaps the bravest attempt yet to chart a peaceful way forward to freedom for China.
History is said to repeat itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.
And it is indeed farcical for China’s government to try to suppress the yearning for freedom in the same brutal ways that Soviet-era communists once did.
For jailing Liu on the absurd charge of trying to overthrow the Chinese state is typical of the type of thinking found in the closed societies of twentieth-century communism, where the state asserted its absolute right to judge every thought and every thinker.
In such a state, the only way to survive was for everyone to become his or her own thought police: self-censoring and never daring to question.
But to judge and imprison one’s own mind, or any other mind, is to criminalize civilization.
In today’s Internet age, moreover, no prison or censorship can destroy an idea whose time has come.
In its current fight with Google, for example, China’s government appears to think that its technologists can provide the means to maintain the old thought control.
But, thankfully, for anyone with persistence and a modicum of computer skill, the Internet leaks like a sieve.
The great progress of China’s economy over the past 30 years is something all Chinese celebrate.
But the jailing of Liu also demonstrates in the starkest terms that China’s neglect of human rights is flowing to the rest of world alongside the mass of Chinese goods.
Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that China opened its economy only to maintain the country’s over-mighty rulers in power, not to respect and enhance the lives of ordinary Chinese.
Although China’s government does not keep any of its international commitments on economic, social, and cultural rights, the world’s democracies appear to have lost their willingness to stand up for their beliefs, as President Barack Obama’s kowtow to China during his November visit painfully demonstrated.
But it was a refusal to buckle to the values of Nazism and Communism in the twentieth century that assured the success of freedom.
Liberty today needs the same type of stalwart defense.
Yes, civilization seems to be on the defensive.
Though many people seem to be in denial about this, politics has retreated to a renewal of the last century’s long struggle for democracy and freedom.
China’s model of authoritarian capitalism appears triumphant, but there is nothing genuinely new about this model; like all dictatorships, it deprives people of political rights and freedom of speech.
And Chinese intellectuals face the cruelest reality: harsh suppression and a popular audience devoted to mammon and materialism.
But the globalization of commercial interests does retain some power to restrict Chinese authoritarianism – particularly its efforts to suppress the peoples of Tibet and Xinjiang – if only the world’s democracies will seize it. Weak states, of course, tend to be cynical about China’s growing might.
Democratic politicians must not surrender their consciences to woo either their own economically jittery citizens or the Chinese regime.
That route will lead only to moral and political decay.
Havel captured this idea perfectly when he criticized Obama’s silence in Beijing on human rights.
Such abasement will only lead people to begin to doubt whether democracy is a living social system.
Fortunately, China’s jailing of Liu Xiaobo will not, as we Chinese say, succeed in its effort to frighten the monkey by killing a chicken.
Liu is too invisible to ordinary Chinese for that to happen.
No, the incarceration of Liu is targeted at those who value democracy, both within China and abroad.
It is an effort to criminalize democratic ideas and force people to choose between them and business with China.
That is a false choice.
China’s economy needs world markets as much as world markets need China, if not more.
Moreover, the West’s inclination to appease China will gradually cause ordinary Chinese to lose confidence that economic modernization will ever set them free.
So continued silence when poets, writers, or lawyers – people like Shi Tao, Yang Tianshui, and Tan Zuoren – are treated like criminals will only assure that China’s markets are eventually lost alongside Chinese freedoms.
A closed society will eventually return to a closed economy.
The real criminal in the Liu Xiaobo affair is, of course, the Chinese state.
But those who think that China’s mutant political authoritarianism and mighty economy can long prevail are guilty as well.
Such a system is as unsuited to the future as Mao’s system was to the past.
The Gulf States’ Expat Dividend
PARIS – How should policymakers in the Middle East’s Gulf States manage their countries’ large expatriate workforces?
In Saudi Arabia, foreign nationals account for roughly one-third of the population.
In Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, nine out of every ten residents is an expatriate.
Should these countries’ governments continue to invest heavily in developing indigenous labor forces, with the aim of decreasing dependency on foreign workers?
The extraordinarily high proportion of foreign labor within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is often considered problematic, because, as some see it, it threatens local cultures and national identities, holds down wages, and impedes the development of domestic skills and talent.
With so many trades and professions dominated by relatively cheap overseas labor, the indigenous population is often left with few occupational domains offering competitive wages.
These tend to be predominantly in the public sector, where oil revenues are used to maintain high pay and attractive working conditions.
But an important dimension of the policy debate within the region risks being overlooked: The Gulf States’ large foreign populations are not just workers; they are also consumers.
By inflating the population of the countries in which they live, expatriate workers are helping drive economic growth.
In fact, the GCC benefits from a double expat dividend: not just a diverse consumer base on the demand side, but also a flexible, youthful workforce on the supply side.
As a result, following the rapid decline in oil prices of recent years, companies could lay off thousands of workers without having to worry about raising the unemployment rate or putting a substantial burden on government coffers.
This unique feature of GCC labor markets enhances the region’s ability to adapt and adjust to fluctuating economic cycles.
Because GCC countries can afford to expand their workforces without running the risk that the share of their elderly population will increase over the long run, they enjoy constant young-to-old and consumer-to-producer “support ratios.”
Moreover, public and private investment in the region – in infrastructure, education, health, and other services – has been geared toward the existing consumer base, inflated by the expat population.
Those inflows are now causing the GCC population to grow four times faster than in emerging markets and the United States, seven times faster than in China, and ten times faster than in the eurozone.
This trend is expected to continue, with annual population growth in the GCC averaging 1.8% – twice the average for emerging markets.
And, according to an IMF study, population growth in the Middle East and North Africa between 1970 and 2000 has raised the annual rate of growth of output per effective consumer by about 0.5-0.6 percentage points.
Larger consumer markets have sufficient economies of scale and diversity to make the introduction of new products and services into the region economically viable.
They have the added benefit of generating what the economist Amar Bhidé calls venturesome consumption: demand-led entrepreneurship and innovation.
Economies of scale also allow the delivery of health, education, and other services, such as entertainment and leisure, at lower prices.
And larger markets provide a greater incentive for investors and traders to enter, and for governments to provide new public goods.
If not for expat populations in rural and remote areas, there would have been little reason to invest in roads, schools, and hospitals – let alone parks, libraries, and theaters.
GCC countries have made such investments for the past four or five decades, and ongoing construction projects in the GCC are estimated to run in the trillions of dollars.
In education, enrollment in K-12 schools across the GCC rose from 2.7 million in 2003 to 10.7 million in 2012, a compound annual growth rate of 16.5%.
Investment in this sector stands at around $150 billion.
In health care, total spending in the region is expected to increase to $133 billion per year by 2018.
The foreign population also provides a human-capital dividend to the local population, as talented expats introduce knowledge and innovation in sectors that the GCC wants to develop.
Research from MIT has shown that an increase in population size is an important driver of technological progress.
And studies in Japan indicate that higher population densities create stronger incentives for individuals to become entrepreneurs; a 10% increase in population density increases the share of people who wish to become entrepreneurs by approximately 1%.
The GCC’s expat dividend could grow much bigger – but only if governments in the region establish the necessary mechanisms.
Such mechanisms should be designed to maximize the benefits that foreign nationals provide.
Work-and-retire or invest-and-retire visas, for example, would encourage expats to save and accumulate pension funds – thereby enabling them to contribute even more significantly to the region’s rapid economic growth.
Gunboat  Democracy?
In one sense, Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction were also weapons of mass distraction.
Without doubt, President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair believed that Saddam Hussein either had, or had the wherewithal to produce, such weapons when they decided for pre-emptive war.
In the case of Iraq, there was particular fear of chemical and biological weapons.
But WMD were not the only motive for war.
Both leaders were outraged about a murderous dictator and hoped that toppling him would open the door for democracy in Iraq.
This (they hoped) would automatically bring about a degree of stability that would help resolve other conflicts in the region, and also guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil.
Mixed motives are not necessarily bad motives.
In fact, most human motives are mixed.
The real question is whether democracy could really have done the trick, and then, whether missiles and tanks are the right method to bring democracy to a country that has suffered dictatorial rule for a long period of time.
Historical precedents played a part in the Iraq decision, not least because President Bush’s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, cited them often.
One example is Nazi Germany.
To be sure, the Allies did not enter that war to bring democracy to Germany. In any case, Germany started the war.
The Allies defended those to whom they were bound by treaty, and then the integrity of their own countries.
Perhaps the entry of the United States into the (European) war had something to do with the post-war order. But there were actually two views about that order.
One was that Germany should be flattened and reduced to a pre-industrial society from which no effective aggression could ever emerge again.
The other was that Germany should be helped on the way to democracy.
As it happened, the protagonists of the first view were sidelined and the proponents of democratization prevailed.
Indeed, the US was effective in using its “soft power” to build democracy in post-war Germany, though Britain was better.
Democratic manners came more naturally to the British occupation forces.
The second example, the end of the Cold War in 1989, was also a success story.
Of course, communism’s collapse was not the result of a pre-emptive strike by the West (though the arms race helped drive the system to implosion).
After 1989, however, Western assistance, not least by the US and Britain, eased the transition to democracy, the rule of law, and market economies in most post-communist countries.
So why does this not seem to work in Iraq?
Evidently, differences of culture and circumstances abound.
Even so, why has so little come of the intention of the Iraq war’s leaders to give democracy a chance in that country?
One reason is that bringing democracy with missiles and tanks is almost a contradiction in terms.
Democracy is by definition a peaceful method of settling conflicts.
Of course, the bombing of Dresden in 1945 was not exactly peaceful.
One must doubt whether it contributed anything to making democracy more acceptable after WWII.
Still, when the fighting was over, the bombing stopped for good, and out of the tanks came people who were intent on creating democratic conditions and capable of doing so.
There is much talk these days about “hard” and “soft power,” about America having one and Europe the other.
In fact, the two belong together.
Soft power without the backing of hard power changes little: witness Iran.
On the other hand, hard power without soft power means only destruction.
It is the greatest single weakness of the US forces that in 2004 – contrary to 1945 – they do not have the capacity to stop the bombing, get out of their tanks, and encourage indigenous democratic development from the bottom up.
Where such capacity exists, there would also be recognition of the fact that democracy does not mean the same institutions in all cultural contexts.
If there are elections in Iraq in January – and this is a very big “if” – they may not resolve much.
Involving the people and providing for peaceful conflict resolution may require institutions peculiar to the region and its history.
It is a great shame that so many Europeans have steered clear of Iraq with a mixture of self-righteousness and anti-American Schadenfreude .
Greater European input might have balanced the “hard power” of the US military machine with the “soft power” of Europe’s experience of diversity and of dealing with post-war situations.
In fact, Europe’s failure is not just a shame, but a historic calamity.
Missiles and tanks alone cannot bring democracy, but coupled with the civil power of sensitive help for the defeated, democracy can be adapted to Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.
Gross Domestic Wellbeing
LONDON – During a 2008 discussion of the global financial crisis at the London School of Economics, Queen Elizabeth II famously floored a room full of financial heavyweights by asking, “Why did no one see it coming?”
That question has been haunting economists ever since, as the recognition has slowly taken hold that, in the supposed “golden age” preceding the crisis, they were blind not only to the potential consequences of failure – but also to the true cost of “success.”
That period was, in many people’s view, tarnished by greed, with rapid GDP growth accompanied by increasing inequality of income and wellbeing.
Leaders in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States seem to understand this, as they call for a new, more comprehensive policy target to replace national output.
And such a target can be established.
Indeed, a group of economists (including me) concluded in a report commissioned by the Legatum Institute that, despite its apparent subjectivity, “wellbeing” – or life satisfaction – can be measured robustly, compared internationally, and used to set policies and judge their success.
The task for governments is to commit to putting this focus on wellbeing into practice.
A few key insights should inform that process.
First, governments would be better served by focusing on stability, even if it means sacrificing some output.
As Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have shown, financial crises are costly because recoveries from them are slow. 
But wellbeing research yields a sharper insight: even if we could bounce back from a crash, the cost would be high.
Boom-and-bust destroy wellbeing, which is diminished far more by a fall in GDP than it is enhanced by an equal and opposite GDP increase.
Second, wellbeing – unlike GDP – is boosted more by increases in income among the poorer segments of the population than by increases among the wealthy.
That is why the richer European economies tend to have large automatic stabilizers built into their public finances.
However, the absence of redistributive mechanisms across countries within the eurozone clearly exacerbated the tensions during the recent crisis.
Third, the implementation of a wellbeing metric to guide policies would have the most rapid – and radical – effect at the national level.
As a measure of policy success, GDP is particularly poorly suited to countries with large public sectors.
The crude output measures that are used, such as the number of medical procedures carried out or the number of fires extinguished, miss a crucial point: while responding to the need for such services is a good thing, reducing the need for them would be better.
And more efficient health services might spend less on hospitals and doctors and more on encouraging healthy lifestyles.
Societies would be better served by a policy focus on factors that have been shown to be critical to life satisfaction: relationships, community, security, and physical and mental health.
For example, while mental health is a key determinant of how people feel about their lives, it remains a low priority in most countries.
In the US, there were more suicides than road deaths last year, and there are three times more suicides than road deaths in Germany and the UK.
In the UK, the vast majority of people diagnosed with mental illness go untreated, at a huge cost not only in wellbeing, but also in disability benefits and lost earning power.
Targeted policies aimed at raising awareness of mental-health issues and improving access to treatment would help to kick-start a recovery in wellbeing.
Of course, specific priorities vary by country.
For example, in aging societies, loneliness and long-term health become particularly important.
The fourth key insight is that indicators of wellbeing interact.
Volunteering does not only enhance the lives of those who are served; it also boosts the life satisfaction of the volunteers.
Likewise, given that unemployment diminishes both wellbeing and national income, effective back-to-work policies score two goals, as do policies aimed at augmenting citizens’ life skills through improved parenting and education.
This has positive implications for funding wellbeing-enhancing programs.
After all, the goal is not to inflate budgets, but to reallocate resources in ways that will ultimately boost citizens’ satisfaction and prosperity.
Finally, reliable data will be critical to guiding efforts and evaluating progress.
Fortunately, most developed countries – and an increasing number of developing countries – recognize the importance of collecting data on wellbeing.
Add to that the parameters for measurement set by the OECD, and international comparisons of wellbeing become possible.
The world is ready for a new, comprehensive metric for national and global progress and prosperity, one that tells us whether people really are better off – and how to ensure that they are.
Hacking for Humanity
CAMBRIDGE – “Life,” Oscar Wilde famously said, “imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.”
In the case of Sony Pictures’ movie The Interview, the world found itself confronted with a further iteration: life imitating art imitating life.
The movie’s release sparked international intrigue, drama, and shadowy geopolitical power struggles.
It even prompted a grave US Presidential address – all for a simple case of hacking.
Hacking into information systems is nothing new; it goes hand in hand with the emergence of telecommunications.
One of the first attacks struck Guglielmo Marconi’s demonstration of radio transmission in 1903, when he communicated from Cornwall to London, 300 miles away.
Nevil Maskelyne, a music-hall magician and would-be wireless tycoon, who had been frustrated by the Italian inventor’s patents, managed to take control of the system and broadcast obscene messages to the Royal Institution’s scandalized audience.
Though hacking is as old as wireless itself, much has changed since Marconi’s time.
Information networks now blanket our planet, collecting and transferring immense amounts of data in real time.
They enable many familiar activities: instantaneous communications, social media, financial transactions, and logistics management.
Most important, information is no longer sequestered in a virtual realm, but permeates the environment in which we live.
The physical, biological, and digital worlds have begun to converge – giving rise to what scientists refer to as “cyber-physical systems.”
Automobiles, for example, have evolved from straightforward mechanical systems into veritable computers on wheels.
The same thing is happening to other consumer goods: We now have connected washing machines and learning thermostats, not to mention Bluetooth toothbrushes and computerized infant scales.
Indeed, cyber-physical systems range from the macro level (think urban transport, like Uber) to the micro (say, the beating of a human heart).
Our very bodies, strapped with connected wearables, are today imbued with more computing power than all of NASA at the time of the Apollo missions.
All of this promises to revolutionize many aspects of human life – mobility, energy management, health care, and much more – and may point toward a greener and more efficient future.
But cyber-physical systems also heighten our vulnerabilities to malicious hacking, an issue that is being discussed at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Far from being isolated in cyberspace, attacks can now have devastating consequences in the physical world.
It is an annoyance when a software virus crashes our computers; but what if the virus crashes our cars?
Malicious hackers are difficult to combat with traditional government and industry tools – the Sony Pictures case being a telling example.
Hacking can be carried out anywhere and everywhere, potentially involving multiple networks in obscure locations.
It defies conventional retaliation and protection strategies.
As then-US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned in 2012, given its current systems, the United States is vulnerable to a “cyber Pearl Harbor” that could derail trains, poison water supplies, and cripple power grids.
So, how can such a scenario be prevented?
One option, surprisingly, could be to promote widespread adoption of hacking itself.
Familiarity with hackers’ tools and methods provides a powerful advantage in diagnosing the strength of existing systems, and even in designing tighter security from the bottom up – a practice known as “white hat” hacking.
Ethical infiltration enables a security team to render digital networks more resistant to attack by identifying the flaws.
This may become routine practice – a kind of cyber fire drill – for governments and businesses, even as academic and industry research focuses in the coming years on the development of further technical safeguards.
In general, today’s defenses take the form of autonomous, constantly vigilant digital “supervisors” – computers and code that control other computers and code.
Similar to traditional military command-and-control protocols, they gain power in numbers and can quickly react to a broad array of attacks.
Such a digital ecosystem strengthens checks and balances, reducing the possibility of failure and mitigating the effects of an incursion.
In such a future scenario, a Hollywood blockbuster might be about networks of computers fighting each other, while humans stand by.
It would portray the broader idea of “singularity,” a hypothetical turning point when the artificial surpasses the human.
Fortunately, in this case, life is still far from imitating art.
Hail to the Technocrats
COPENHAGEN – Is the European Union’s supposed “democratic deficit” now spreading to individual European countries in the wake of the sovereign-debt crisis?
The rise of unelected technocrats to political power in Greece and Italy suggests, at least superficially, that the old taboo against technocratic governments pursuing an EU-dictated agenda has been shattered.
Consider Italy. Most Italians breathed a collective sigh of relief that three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is being replaced by a technocrat par excellence, former European Commissioner Mario Monti, a respected economist.
Greece, too, is turning over the reigns of government to an unelected, and supposedly apolitical, technocrat, Lucas Papademos, a former vice president of the European Central Bank.
Of course, there are many things wrong with the EU nowadays, but a widening of its so-called “democratic deficit” is not one of them.
Indeed, that perceived deficit is something of a politically convenient canard.
Scholars such as Princeton University’s Andrew Moravcsik have long argued that the EU’s legitimacy comes not from the ballot box, but from its ability to provide concrete benefits to citizens.
What the EU achieves through integrating markets – or even eliminating passport controls – underscores the benefits of its “delegated democracy.”
Indeed, it is precisely the Eurocrats’ detachment from everyday politics that has enabled the EU to deliver.
Contrary to the ranting of Euroskeptic politicians in Britain and, increasingly, in eurozone member countries, the growing disenchantment of voters with politics reflects the distance that has grown between promises and results, not the distance between EU officials and member states’ citizens.
According to an alarming poll published recently by the leading Italian newspaper La Repubblica, more than 22% of Italians find no great differences between an authoritarian and a democratic system of government.
Another 10% believe that an authoritarian regime is better and more effective than a democratic political system.
This disturbing decline of faith in democracy, which is not confined to Italy, brings us back to the powerful rationale underlying Europeans’ growing reliance on technocratic governance: security.
From the end of World War II to the collapse of the Soviet Union, what brought Europeans closer together was not the dream of a Europe-wide, democratic polity, but, above all, their desire to be safe and secure.
Throughout the post-war years, the narrative of European integration almost always focused on the quest for political, social, and economic security.
With violent demonstrations in the streets of Athens, Madrid, and Rome, it is not hard to understand why some people may once again choose to give priority to their security, particularly their economic security.
Europe’s technocrats worked in the service of security ahead of the EU’s enlargement in 2004 to the former communist states of Central Europe.
The EU’s bureaucracy played a key part in helping those countries to navigate the complex transition from socialist autocracy to capitalist democracy.
At the time, few people acknowledged this, because Eurocrats rarely make headlines.
But their success in applying technical standards to countries seeking EU membership earned them huge legitimacy.
The unwritten rule in Europe seems to be that, the more depoliticized the process, the more legitimacy technocrats can earn.
Conversely, whenever politics gets in the way of a decision, bureaucrats lose credibility.
One objection to delegating political authority to technocrats is that such appointments amount to a humiliating constraint on sovereignty.
In normal times, that is unacceptable to most citizens. But in times of crisis, the voice of the neutral technocrat gains greater legitimacy.
Monti, for example, was among the first to sound the alarm about Italy’s dire finances.
But, attesting to the technocrat’s neutrality, back in August he also warned about the implications of demands by non-elected international institutions (in this case, the European Central Bank) for particular policies in exchange for support of Italian bonds in international markets.
Monti called this podestà forestiero, something of a foreign overlordship based in Brussels, Washington, and Frankfurt, as well as Berlin and Paris.
The EU is a voluntary pooling of national sovereignty, but the demands now being made of Italy (and Greece) are the Diktat of other sovereign nations.
A national-unity government run by a technocrat in place of an administration run by elected politicians does not qualitatively change the fact that outsiders are demanding reforms.
But voters in a time of crisis may be wiser than most politicians: for the past two decades, Italy’s most popular statesman has consistently been Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a former central banker called in to run an emergency interim government in the mid-1990’s.
Of course, a technocratic government is an anomaly to the extent that it constitutes a damning verdict on the performance of a country’s entire political class.
But voters in the battered lands of the eurozone seem to have reached their own damning conclusions about their elected leaders months ago.
Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, wrote that “a leader is best when people barely know he exists.”
With Europe’s crisis-stricken governments increasingly turning to unelected technocrats, one can almost see citizens nodding in agreement.
Hair of the Top Dog
NEW YORK – Much has been written about Donald Trump’s peculiar hairstyle, the kind of puffy, dyed comb-over one would associate with a downmarket nightclub manager rather than a presidential candidate.
Is there really any more to be said?
Actually, the question of hair in politics might not be as trivial as it seems.
It is remarkable how many politicians, especially on the populist right, have sported heterodox hairdos.
Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s former prime minister, used black pencil to fill in the patches not covered by his two hair transplants.
The Dutch demagogue Geert Wilders dyes his Mozartian bouffant platinum blond.
Boris Johnson, the Brexit rabble-rouser, now UK foreign secretary, takes care to keep his straw-colored thatch in a permanent state of studied untidiness.
All have scored highly with voters filled with anger and resentment at polished urban elites.
Then there was the father of modern European populism, the late Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who had no hair at all.
But his shiny, clean-shaven pate stood out as much among the neat gray coiffures of mainstream politicians as Johnson’s blond mop or Trump’s gilded comb-over (all these men, except Berlusconi, are blonds, by the way, or fake blonds; dark hair doesn’t seem to work so well with the populist mob).
Standing out is of course the point.
The strange hair, or shaven head, makes the popular leader instantly recognizable.
This type of branding is common among dictators.
Hitler’s visual image could be reduced to a greasy cowlick and a toothbrush moustache.
The oddest-looking of all contemporary dictators must be North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, whose clean-shaven back and sides are cultivated as a deliberate imitation of his grandfather’s 1930s proletarian hairstyle.
His father, Kim Jong-il, tried – albeit with little success – to emulate Elvis Presley’s pompadour.
But self-parody sometimes works in democracies too.
Winston Churchill, who in many ways is Johnson’s model, always made sure to carry a big cigar, even when he had no intention of smoking it.
There was not much he could do about his sparse hair, but he certainly dressed differently than anyone else.
No other British politician, even during the war, wore the kind of zipped-up boilersuit Churchill adopted.
Studied nonchalance, or cultivated eccentricity, was a sign of the typical aristocrat who felt no need to conform to the boring standards of middle-class correctness.
Churchill understood something that many mainstream politicians miss.
The way to the masses’ hearts is not to pretend that you are just like them.
On the contrary, if you are from the upper class, you lay it on thick, you turn yourself into a caricature of the higher born, like the old-fashioned aristocrat who despises the timid bourgeois, but gets on fine with his gamekeeper.
Johnson is not an aristocrat, but he went to Eton and can easily pose as one, a skill he uses to great effect.
The US does not have a formal aristocracy.
Status is more a question of money.
One of the secrets of Trump's popularity is that he flaunts his supposed great wealth.
He even exaggerates it, if necessary.
The absurd golden chairs in his pastiche Louis XIV homes are a coarse imitation of aristocratic style.
Fortuyn, on a more modest Dutch scale, and Berlusconi, on a more grandiose Italian stage, had similar tastes.
People for whom this is the stuff of dreams admired them for it.
Affirming the dreams of people who have little is the key to successful populism.
The main thing is that these politicians are not like the dull and moderate mainstream.
Even insiders have to pose as outsiders, who can stand with the common man against the political establishment.
Weirdness – peculiar upper-class mannerisms, ostentatious living, outrageous jokes, deliberate crassness, and mad hairstyles – is an asset.
I am not sure that people, who rightly see Trump as a great danger to the US and the world, sufficiently appreciate this.
Much has been made of the reasonable and moderate tone of the Democratic National Convention, compared to the “dark,” snarling bombast of the Republicans’ event.
President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton herself were paragons of dignity, compared to Trump’s Mussolini-like mannerisms and verbal aggression.
Clinton supporters, at the convention and elsewhere, tend to attack Trump with ridicule, the method once used by Voltaire against the dogmas of the Catholic Church.
Ridicule can be an effective weapon.
In the 1920s, journalists like H.L. Mencken made Christian fundamentalists in the US look so foolish that they dropped out of politics for several generations.
Trump’s mad and offensive braggadocio, his vulgar tastes, and his extraordinary looks are all eminently ripe for satire.
Comedians like Jon Stewart have had merciless fun at his expense.
But satire and ridicule will not work to persuade people who love Trump precisely because of his weirdness.
It sets him apart from the establishment they despise.
Charisma does not call for restraint in words, appearance, or manner.
The weirder he gets, the more his supporters like him.
And the more that clever comedians in New York mock him, the more his fans will rally to his side.
This is the great perversity in our age of angry populism.
Reasonable arguments and political optimism can now be turned into negative qualities, the typical marks of a complacent elite, oblivious to the concerns of people who feel that the joke has been on them.
Reasonable argument did not work to convince 51.9% of British voters to remain part of the EU.
It may not work to keep an ignorant and dangerous buffoon – silly hairstyle and all – from becoming President of the US.
Haiti and the Limits of Generosity
MELBOURNE – All over the world, people have responded generously to the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti.
In just three days, more than a million Americans had donated $10 with the aid of text messages from their cellphones.
People with very little themselves, like Maria Pacheco, an unemployed single mother from Chicago, donated food and clothes.
Others did whatever they could – from pedicures to washing cars – to raise money.
On current indications, the amount Americans will give to relief efforts in Haiti could surpass the $1.9 billion they gave to assist victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which until now has stood as a record for donations to a disaster outside the United States.
Given that the US is undergoing economic hard times, the size of the response has surprised many.
Haiti ’s proximity, plus the fact that close to a million Haitians live in the US, goes some way towards explaining why Americans have responded so generously.
But the response has been worldwide.
In Melbourne for the Australian Open, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and other stars held an exhibition match that led to donations of $600,000.
In Rwanda, a group of community health workers making less than $200 a month raised $7,000 for Haiti.
All of this raises many questions about how we respond – and how we should respond – to such tragedies.
The earthquake killed up to 200,000 people. Terrible as that is, it is fewer than the number of children who, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, die every 10 days from avoidable, poverty-related causes.
Moreover, as Elie Hassenfeld has argued on GiveWell.net, there are good grounds for thinking that disaster relief is less cost-effective than aid aimed at saving the lives of those who are risk from extreme poverty.
Why do people give generously to earthquake victims, but not to prevent the much larger number of deaths brought about by extreme poverty, insufficient food, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and the absence of even the most basic health care?
Media saturation obviously makes a critical difference.
Scenes from Hurricane Katrina, the Asian tsunami, and now the Haitian earthquake were shown over and over again on all television news broadcasts.
An earthquake in a remote part of Pakistan that killed 80,000 people received relatively little television coverage, and a much less generous response.
The daily deaths of children in poor countries from diarrhea, measles, and malaria are part of the background of the world we live in, and so are not news at all.
Suppose that a million children all in one place seemed likely to be swept away and drowned by approaching floodwaters. The media coverage would be enormous.
Now imagine the jubilation if they were saved!
And imagine the acclaim for the heroes who had saved so many children.
Yet when UNICEF announced, in September of last year, that the number of children dying each year from poverty-related causes had dropped by one million, as compared to two years earlier, the story got very little media attention.
The people who contributed to this drop by delivering effective basic health care, building a supply of safe water, or immunizing children against measles remain largely unknown.
Perhaps people respond more generously to the victims of natural disasters than they do to those in extreme poverty because, after a natural disaster, we tend not to blame the victims.
We seem to accept that to be struck by an earthquake, a tidal wave, or a hurricane is just bad luck (unless, as the American evangelist Pat Robertson suggested after the Haitian earthquake, your ancestors made a pact with the devil in order to free themselves from colonial rule).
Still, many people profess to believe that poverty is the result of not working hard enough, or of having too many children.
But the circumstances that produce extreme poverty are not, except in rare cases, under the control of such poor people.
They may be, to some extent, under the control of governments, and undoubtedly bad government is a major contributor to poverty. But then, bad government can also contribute to the toll exacted by a natural disaster.
Two years ago, a team of geophysicists led by Eric Calais of Purdue University predicted that the fault that produced the recent Haitian earthquake was at high risk of doing exactly what it did.
They urged the Haitian government to take steps to strengthen critical buildings, including hospitals and schools.
Failure to do so contributed to the toll.
What should we do?
Brian Tucker, founder of the non-profit organization Geohazards International, urges that 10% of the money raised by relief efforts should be set aside for mitigating damage from future earthquakes: training builders, improving engineering, and making the public more aware of the risks and how to reduce them.
He claims that every dollar invested in preparing for natural disasters saves ten dollars in future damage.
Tucker’s proposal makes good sense, but it is difficult – and arguably unethical – for charities that raised money to help Haitians now to divert some of those funds to programs to mitigate the damage caused by future earthquakes.
It would be excellent if the general public responded to an appeal for funds for mitigating future damage. But the prospects of that happening are slim, because such an appeal would lack the emotional pull of the desire to help immediate victims.
Instead, governments that are pledging aid to Haiti now should ensure that part of their assistance goes to reducing the chances that such a disaster will affect Haiti so dramatically again.
Haiti’s State-Building Challenge
SANTO DOMINGO -- The $5 billion in short-term aid for Haiti, and the $10 billion pledged for its long-term reconstruction at the International Donors’ Conference on March 31, is a vote of confidence in the potential of collective international action.
The question, however, is not only one of money; it is about whether Haiti’s agony is to be addressed as just one more humanitarian crisis or as a structural problem of state building – a long-term quest for institutional stability and sustainable development.
Conspicuously, Haiti’s Dominican neighbors were the first to gauge the magnitude of the problem and the global nature of the required solution.
The Dominican government’s decision to hold a summit on Haiti’s future has the objective of securing the international community’s ongoing commitment to Haiti, beyond the generous response to the catastrophe produced by the earthquake in January.
In addition to harmonizing the flow of donations and an agreed-upon list of development projects, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez seeks to make clear that the task is a long-term enterprise: re-founding the failing Haitian state.
A believer in the essentially political nature of Haiti’s tragedy, Fernandez rightly aspires to turn the current crisis into the lever for state-building, Haiti’s extraction from political isolation, and its maturation into an active member of the regional and world community.
It is to be hoped that the current global economic crisis does not undermine the reliability of the world’s commitments to Haiti.
After all, even in times of prosperity, the international community has been notorious for making grand pledges, only to renege when it comes to following through with the money.
Keeping alive the international community’s commitment – that is, seeking an international solution to Haiti’s tragedy – is a vital necessity for the Dominicans.
Their initiative is essentially driven by the fear that once Haiti’s immediate humanitarian crisis is addressed, the country’s underlying problems could be left at the door of the “prosperous” neighbors across the border.
A case like the island of La Española (Hispaniola), where a simple border can reflect such vast differences, is not very common.
On one side of the border is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, a place where 56% of the population survives on less than one dollar a day.  On the other side of the island stands a stable democracy with a promising outlook for a reasonably prosperous future.
For Dominicans, helping Haiti develop and become politically stable is the best way to safeguard their own stability.
That was also the logic of the Barcelona Process in the late 1990’s, whereby the European Union worked to promote the development and democratization of the countries of the Maghreb as the best way to stem the uncontrolled tide of illegal immigration into Europe.
But, unlike the EU, the Dominican Republic is not an economic giant that can assume exclusive responsibility for extracting Haiti from its Biblical destitution.
The Dominicans are right to seek at least a more solid regional commitment.
The Haitian refugee crisis in the early 1990’s tragically showed that no country in the region – including the United States, which either repatriated most illegal immigrants or confined them to the hardship of open camps in Guantánamo Bay – was ready to absorb the Haitians who fled their politically torn country.
So long as the Haitian state remains fragile and the Haitian economy continues to decompose, the network of mafias living on illegal immigration into the Dominican Republic will continue to flourish.
About one million Haitians now live in the Dominican Republic, but only about 10% of the Haitian laborers in the country are there legally, a condition that invites their exploitation by greedy employers.
Cheap Haitian labor has become a substitute for less-skilled Dominican labor in a way that increases income inequalities, and puts a special burden on the country’s public finances and services, owing to lower tax revenues.
Though the Dominican Republic suffers from its own social and economic maladies – it is itself an exporter of emigrants to the US, Puerto Rico, and Spain – it certainly has a role to play in Haiti’s reconstruction.
But it must supersede the exclusivist attitudes held by many members of its political class, particularly given that much of its economic growth in recent years reflects the contribution of Haitian immigration.
The two countries are condemned by history and geography to develop civilized neighborly relations.
Haitians should not be encouraged to seek a solution to their tragic plight simply by crossing the border, but Dominicans should not demonize Haiti as the source of all their problems.
Both sides need to engage in the vital enterprise of turning the border that separates them into a benign space of transnational development and stability.
Precisely because developing a mutually beneficial border regime is, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rightly remarked in her 2009 visit to the island, a task that affects the two countries’ stability and well-being, it also needs to be part of the current international reconstruction effort.
But Clinton should be reminded that every free industrial zone that was built along the Israeli-Palestinian border eventually fell victim to political instability.
Haiti’s transition to effective and sustainable statehood is therefore also vital for establishing a prosperous border regime.
Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads
Palestinian politics is approaching the point of no return.
The power struggle between the Islamist Hamas and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and his secular/nationalist Fatah movement is intensifying, with tensions breaking into outright combat.
Since Hamas was founded in the early 1980’s, it has refused to come under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Hamas’s victory in the parliamentary election earlier this year – a democratic watershed – demonstrated that it had come of age politically.
For the first time in Palestinian history, a religious party is dominant.
But Fatah has not accepted defeat, while Hamas is convinced that elements within Fatah agree with Israeli and American plans to topple the Hamas government.
Abbas remains the Palestinian president, and the Basic Law makes him commander of all Palestinian security forces.
However, while most official security forces remain loyal to him, over the past year Hamas has created an alternative security structure, built around a 4000-member “Operational Force.”
Moreover, Hamas has announced plans to recruit 1,500 additional security personnel for the West Bank, Fatah’s stronghold.
In recent weeks, the two sides have clashed frequently across the Gaza strip, heightening tensions further.
The confrontations have come at a time when Abbas has been trying to persuade Hamas to moderate its anti-Israel stance and ally with Fatah in a national unity government.
Abbas believes that Hamas’s acceptance of negotiations with Israel is the only way to break the international sanctions that are devastating Palestinian society.
Despite this, both sides are building up their forces.
Intelligence reports suggest that Hamas is smuggling weapons and explosives from the Sinai into the Gaza Strip at an accelerated pace.
The United States, Israel, and some Arab governments plan to arm and train forces loyal to Abbas, especially his presidential guard.
They want to prepare Abbas’s forces in Gaza for a confrontation with Hamas, which they believe is inevitable.
Israel is considering Abbas’s request to transfer arms and ammunitions from Egypt and Jordan in hopes of bolstering his loyalist forces.
There is also an American proposal to allow the Badr Brigade – a wing of the Palestine Liberation Army that is currently stationed in Jordan – to relocate to the Palestinian territories as Abbas’s rapid reaction force in Gaza in anticipation of a feared civil war.
The Badr Brigade is composed of several thousand Palestinians, mostly long-time PLO activists.
As the maneuvering continues, Israel and Egypt find themselves working together to bolster Abbas and Fatah.
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard, Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah, and has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas’s abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
But Egypt’s government is angry with Hamas for opposing the formation of a coalition government.
Indeed, the seizure of Shalit deepened the rift between Hamas and Fatah, which believes that the abduction was staged in order to sabotage discussions about a national unity government.
More generally, Egypt is concerned that Gaza is becoming politically radicalized and may be transformed into “Hamastan.”
This, Egypt fears, would give a boost to its own Islamic radicals, against which the government has long fought.
Egypt also worries about a possible Hamas-Fatah civil war.
Although Hamas has ruled this out, it has shown no hesitation to use heavy force against its opponents.
Likewise, Foreign Minister Mahmoud Al-Zahar of the Hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by Abbas would be a recipe for civil war.
Fear of major fighting has already sent many Palestinians into Egypt, leading to the deployment of Egyptian troops on the border to control any mass exodus.
Israel, meanwhile, is worried that Hamas has strengthened its military grip on Gaza, in terms of both fortifications and networks capable of launching Qassam rockets into neighboring Israeli towns.
Israel might not wait for Abbas and his forces, but rather launch a full-scale intervention to weaken Hamas.
Can Hamas and Fatah put aside their differences and form a unity government?
Abbas says that if a coalition government is not agreed upon within the next two weeks, he will dissolve the current government, a move Hamas will not tolerate.
But forming a coalition government is unlikely to ease the tension between Hamas and Fatah.
New confrontations would likely emerge as soon as a new government was formed.
Ironically, the most likely way to avoid large-scale confrontation between Fatah and Hamas is through an Israeli incursion into Gaza.
Facing the Israelis together is the only way that the rival Palestinian groups will postpone their own bloody showdown.
Hamas Comes in from the Cold
GAZA CITY – In the wake of revolutionary change in the Middle East, the forces of political Islam have scored one electoral victory after another.
As the West grapples with the rapid rise of moderate Islamists in Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, the issue of Hamas’s role in the Palestinian territories looms large.
The signing of a new unity deal between Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s secular Fatah party earlier this month has heightened an unprecedented struggle within Hamas over its future course as an Islamist movement.
How the West responds could very well influence the outcome.
As events in recent weeks have proven, Hamas’s days of near-total isolation in the Middle East are over.
While most Western governments continue to consider it a terrorist organization, in Arab capitals, political embargos have given way to engagement.
In December, Ismail Haniyeh, Prime Minister of the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority in Gaza, embarked on a tour of the Mediterranean that included stops in Tunis, Cairo, and Istanbul.
In mid-February, he was warmly received in Qatar, Bahrain, and Iran.
This political outreach, however, has not emanated solely from Gaza.
In January, Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas’s Damascus-based political bureau, embarked on a diplomatic initiative of his own, and was hosted by King Abdullah of Jordan – the first such visit in more than a decade. In February, Mashal crowned these efforts in Qatar with the signing of the new unity agreement with Fatah, which commits both Palestinian movements to a transitional government under Abbas’s leadership.
Ever since, disagreements within Hamas have been escalating, pitting the movement’s Diaspora leadership against the Hamas-led Gaza administration, which has openly rejected the unity deal.
While personal ambitions certainly play a role in the tensions, what lies at the core is a fundamental conflict over Hamas’s character.
Haniyeh, who represents the conservative wing of Gaza’s Hamas leadership, has sought to cash in on regional changes.
His long-boycotted government was thrown a lifeline by regime change in Egypt and the opening of the border with Gaza.
Notably, Haniyeh’s recent diplomatic tour garnered not only symbolic recognition for Hamas, but also support for his uncompromising stance vis-à-vis Israel.
He missed no opportunity to criticize “futile” peace negotiations, and, in Tehran, he pledged that Hamas’s “resistance” would continue “until all Palestinian land has been liberated.”
What that means needs little clarification.
In a further telling move, Haniyeh also recently suggested merging Hamas with the Islamic Jihad movement, which continues to target Israeli civilians with rockets fired from Gaza.
Mashal, by contrast, has come to represent a force of change.
Last May, he signed an initial reconciliation agreement with Fatah in Cairo, which committed Hamas to a Palestinian unity government, called for a cessation of violence, and accepted the notion of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.
Mashal also offered Abbas a one-year mandate for negotiations with Israel, and, unlike Haniyeh, supported recent Israeli-Palestinian “exploratory talks” in Jordan.
One reason for Mashal’s change of heart can be found in the ongoing popular revolt in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad.
The leader of the Sunni Hamas can no longer support his Syrian host, who has cracked down on the Sunni-dominated opposition.
Thus, Mashal has attempted to close ranks with Fatah, and is seeking to move Hamas’s Diaspora headquarters from Damascus – a powerful symbol of his efforts at re-invention.
But Mashal’s refusal to support Assad has not only forced him to re-locate.
It has also unleashed the wrath of Syria’s ally, Iran, which has responded by scaling down its financial support for Hamas – thus denying Mashal a key source of influence within the movement.
Indeed, Mashal’s decision has effectively ended his ties to his two most important allies, thereby not only weakening his position, but also increasing his readiness to embrace political moderation.
Tensions increased dramatically when Mashal signed the unity agreement with Fatah, after stating his intention to resign as head of the political bureau.
While that announcement may have been political blackmail aimed at forcing Gaza into line, it underscored Mashal’s confidence in his popularity, which has since been vindicated by expressions of support from both within and outside of the political bureau for him to remain in charge.
Mashal has more than one option. He may reemerge as the head of a newly established Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, or as a leader of a new Islamist political party under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Such a merging of Hamas with the established Palestinian political organizations would signify Hamas’s formal acceptance of a two-state solution, and would mark an important step in transforming the movement.
For the West, using the opportunity to influence Hamas’s future course requires modifying the failed policy of all-encompassing rejection.
As in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, Islamist moderates in the Palestinian territories need to be engaged as a legitimate political force.
Leaders such as Mashal, who has expressed a readiness to forsake alliances with Syria and Iran and to accept a two-state solution with Israel, should be bolstered rather than boycotted.
That means supporting the ongoing effort to form an interim Palestinian government of technocrats, as stipulated in the Qatar agreement.
At times, such an approach will be challenging; Hamas will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult counterpart.
But the United States, European governments, and Israel should take this opportunity to engage Hamas’s moderates and test their flexibility.
In the new Middle East, the West’s current approach will only strengthen the hardliners in Gaza and elsewhere.
Hamas, Fatah, and the Palestinian Dilemma
GAZA CITY – With dueling authorities running Gaza and the West Bank, the Palestinian people find themselves in the middle of an experiment.
In Gaza, where Hamas is in charge, the high price of armed resistance to Israel has discredited any attempts to revive the conflict.
In the West Bank, under Fatah rule, negotiations have gone nowhere.
Neither track of Palestinian politics – resistance or negotiation – offers hope of achieving independence.
As a result, Palestinians face their most difficult challenge since 1948. 
Israeli threats of renewing its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip are taken very seriously.
The scenes of devastation are still vivid in the streets and neighborhoods of Gaza, and Hamas is taking no chances of provoking Israel into a new war.
The fighting cost Hamas two of its top leaders, Saeed Siyam and Nizar Rayan, and significantly weakened its military capabilities.
Only recently have these been rebuilt.
Hamas finds itself in a difficult position, since its policy calls for strong resistance, alongside politics.
Yet this policy has failed.
Hamas has put pressure on all resistance groups in Gaza to refrain from provoking Israel.
In an unprecedented statement, Mahmoud al-Zahar, a top Hamas leader, said any missiles fired at Israel from Gaza would be “betrayal missiles.”
Instead, Hamas has turned its attention to the West Bank, where it has no political authority.
It has called on Palestinians there to launch a new intifada against Israel, even while insisting on calm in the Gaza Strip.
Fatah, which runs the West Bank, wants no part of another Palestinian uprising.
President Mahmoud Abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy.
But, with their government unable to do anything about the expansion of Israeli settlements, including in East Jerusalem, as well as continued conflicts over holy sites in Hebron, Bethlehem, and the Al-Aksa mosque, West Bank Palestinians are extremely frustrated.
Recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to Israeli rule.
The Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank, is afraid that a popular, non-violent intifada might quickly turn violent.
If so, Israel might use it as a pretext to crush the Palestinians and their newly built institutions.
This has happened before, during the last intifada in 2002.
There is another scenario that also terrifies Fatah leaders.
An outbreak of violence could strengthen Hamas and its military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, in the West Bank.
This, in turn, could produce a repeat of the scenario that brought Hamas to power in Gaza in June 2007, when all Fatah authority in the area collapsed after the Israeli withdrawal.
Yet the peace process has been stalled for more than a year, greatly reducing Fatah’s credibility in the West Bank.
Abbas has repeatedly described peace as a strategic choice for the Palestinians.
But, 17 years since the signing of the Oslo agreement and the launch of bilateral talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, there has been very little movement toward a Palestinian state.
In popular opinion, negotiations have reached a dead end.
Arab diplomats also show few signs of optimism.
At its recent summit in Libya, the Arab League rejected the proximity talks proposed by the United States’ Middle East peace envoy, George Mitchell.
The Arab position is that no proximity talks can be held until Israel freezes its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Palestinian and Arab opinion is waiting for the US, as Israel’s ally, to intervene and press for concessions.
Though the Palestinian economy in the West Bank has improved greatly under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, this is no substitute for serious peace negotiations.
In August 2009, Fayyad declared his vision of a Palestinian state in two years.
Under his blueprint, which has received strong financial support from the US and the European Union, the political, economic, and security infrastructure of the Palestinian state would be ready by August 2011.
Fayyad has also gained the backing of Fatah and most other Palestinian groups in the West Bank.
Fayyad’s strategy for international recognition of a Palestinian state is to fight a legal battle against Israel in the United Nations Security Council and other international bodies.
He is convinced that establishing a Palestinian state would serve the interest of all parties, and that the odds favor the Palestinians in international political struggle.
Hamas does not share this view, and Palestinian reconciliation efforts have reached an impasse.
The Arab League has given Egypt the lead role in bringing the two sides together, but Hamas has spurned Egypt’s proposals.
Now, with questions about President Hosni Mubarak’s successor in the air, Egypt has put aside these talks.
Palestinians are looking instead to Iran, Hamas’ ally, for signs of any revival in discussions between Fatah and Hamas.
Palestinians’ choices are limited, and there is no consensus among them on how to proceed.
But there is a growing sense that the waiting game cannot last much longer.  Whatever comes next will most likely come soon.
Hamas in Power
The victory of the fundamentalist Hamas in the Palestinian elections will have far-reaching consequences for the region, some totally unexpected.
Two aspects, however, are already visible.
The Hamas victory is, first and foremost, an indication of the total failure of the traditional Palestinian leadership to create a body politic.
Palestine is not yet a state, but it is already a failed one.
Since the Oslo Accords of l993 between Israel and the PLO, the Palestinians enjoyed limited transitional autonomy.
To be sure, the new Palestinian Authority (PA) took power under difficult conditions, but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern?
The PA had an opportunity to lay the institutional foundations for a functioning state.
But, but instead of supplying the population with the necessary infrastructure – economic development, education, welfare, medical services, housing, and refugee rehabilitation – Yasser Arafat’s Fatah-led PA spent more than 70% of its meager budget on a dozen competing security and intelligence services, neglecting all other spheres of activity.
It created what is called in Arabic a Mukhabarat (security services) state, very much like what is prevalent in almost all Arab countries – Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, republics and monarchies alike.
The vacuum that the PA left elsewhere, including the social sphere, was filled by Hamas.
Indeed, its popularity is due not only to its fundamentalist Islamic ideology and its commitment to the destruction of Israel.
The high esteem in which Palestinians hold Hamas also grew out of what Hamas actually did for them while the PA squandered its resources.
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it.
Hamas set up better schools, kindergartens, crèches for mothers, medical centers, welfare services, and programs for youth and women – all of this in addition giving special grants to the families of suicide bombers.
In the elections, Hamas received its dividend for doing what the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority failed to do.
It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism: it certainly is a possibility, and one should not prejudge the outcome.
But nor, on the other hand, is it clear that the existing organs of the Palestinian Authority – especially the security services at its disposal – will allow a peaceful transfer of power.
Indeed, no such precedent exists: there has never been a peaceful transfer of power in any of the Arab League’s 22 member states.
Israel’s response to Hamas’s victory will obviously be complicated by its own elections on March 28, and by a government headed by an interim prime minister, Ehud Olmert, owing to Sharon’s incapacitation just weeks after leaving Likud and founding a new, centrist party, Kadima (Forward).
Despite Sharon's absence, Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls – the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud, under Binyamin Netanyahu.
Kadima’s success is due to Sharon’s main innovation in Israeli politics: the successful unilateral disengagement from Gaza.
That withdrawal was based on the conviction that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions are too wide to enable meaningful negotiations.
Hence, Israel must start deciding the future boundaries of the country unilaterally, hoping for eventual negotiations at a later stage.
This is also the line adopted by Olmert.
But Hamas’s victory suggests that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian sides will grow even wider, and that the chances for a negotiated settlement will recede even farther into the future.
This leaves further unilateral Israeli moves – such as a partial set of withdrawals from selected areas in the West Bank – as the only feasible option.
Realistic conflict management will replace utopian hopes for conflict resolution.
In a region full of paradoxes, the Hamas victory may have added another one: usually, when extremists on one side become stronger, it plays into the hands of extremists on the other side, producing a dangerous spiral effect.
In this case, however, the victory of the extremist Hamas may strengthen not the extremists of Likud, but, surprisingly, the more moderate centrists of Kadima.
One cannot be certain of such an outcome, of course, but it is now the best that one can realistically hope for.
Hamas’s Real Enemies
JERUSALEM – In Iran, elements from within the regime are reportedly offering a $1 million reward for the assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak because of his opposition to Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
In Lebanon, the leader of Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, merely calls for the Egyptian government’s overthrow.
In response to this, Tariq Alhomayed, a Saudi who is editor-in-chief of the newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat , describes Hamas as Iran’s tool, and argues that “Iran is a real threat to Arab security.”
Egypt’s foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, agrees – and he is not alone.
When Arab states met to discuss the Gaza crisis, Saudi Arabia vetoed any action.
Even the Palestinian Authority (PA) blames Hamas for the fighting.
Activists in Fatah, Hamas’s nationalist rival which runs the PA, make no secret of their hope that Hamas loses the war.
Welcome to the new Middle East, characterized no longer by the Arab-Israeli conflict, but by an Arab nationalist-Islamist conflict.
Recognizing this reality, virtually all Arab states – other than Iran’s ally, Syria – and the PA want to see Hamas defeated in the Gaza Strip.
Given their strong self-interest in thwarting Islamist revolutionary groups, especially those aligned with Iran, they are not inclined to listen to the “Arab street” – which is far quieter than it was during previous conflicts, such as the 1991 war in Kuwait, the 2000-2004 Palestinian uprising, or the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.
Today’s Middle East is very different from the old one in many significant ways.
First, the internal politics of every Arab country revolves around a battle between Arab nationalist rulers and an Islamist opposition.
In other words, Hamas’s allies are the regimes’ enemies.
An Islamist state in the Gaza Strip would encourage those who seek to create similar entities in Egypt, Jordan, and every other Arab country.
Already, a tremendous price has been paid in lives and treasure for this conflict.
The violence has included civil wars among Palestinians and Algerians; the bloodshed in Iraq; and terrorist campaigns in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
In the Palestinian case, after winning an election victory and making a deal with Fatah for a coalition government, Hamas turned on its nationalist rivals and drove them out of Gaza by force.
In return, the PA has been repressing Hamas in the West Bank.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah has been trying to bully its more moderate Sunni Muslim, Christian, and Druze rivals into submission.
Second, because Arab states confront an Iran-Syria alliance that includes Hamas and Hezbollah, in addition to internal conflicts, there is a regional battle between these two blocs.
An aspect of this is that the largely Sunni Muslim-led states face a largely Shia Muslim-led competitor for regional hegemony.
These two problems pose far greater dangers to the existing states than does any (largely fabricated) Israeli threat, and the region’s rulers know it.
On the other side of the divide, Iran and its allies have put forward the banners of jihad and “resistance.”
Their platform includes: Islamist revolution in every country; Iran as the region’s dominant state, backed up by nuclear weapons; no peace with Israel and no Palestinian state until there can be an Islamist one encompassing all of Israel (as well as the West Bank and Gaza Strip); and the expulsion of Western influence from the region.
This is a very ambitious program, probably impossible to achieve.
Nevertheless, it is a prescription for endless terrorism and war: both pro- and anti-Iranian revolutionary Islamists believe that, because God is on their side and their enemies are cowardly, they will win, and they are quite prepared to spend the next half-century trying to prove it.
While this seems to be a very pessimistic assessment of the regional situation, the radical Islamist side has many weaknesses.
Launching losing wars may make Islamists feel good, but being defeated is a costly proposition, for their arrogance and belligerence antagonizes many who might otherwise be won over to their cause.
In addition, the situation provides a good opportunity for Western policymakers.
The emphasis should be on building coalitions among the relatively moderate states that are threatened by radical Islamist forces, and on working hard to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons – a goal that is in the interests of many in the region.
The worst mistake would be to follow the opposite policy – an inevitably futile effort to appease the extremists or seek to moderate them.
Such a campaign actually disheartens the relative moderates who, feeling sold out, will try to cut their own deal with Tehran.
The current crisis in Gaza is only one aspect of the much wider battle shaking the region.
Helping Hamas would empower radical Islamism and Iranian ambitions, while undercutting the PA and everyone else, not just Israel.
Arab states don’t want to help their worst enemy. Why should anyone else?
Italy’s Downward Spiral
MUNICH – Italy is now in a triple-dip recession.
But it didn’t get there by itself.
Yes, the economy’s long slide reflects Italian leaders’ failure to confront the country’s loss of competitiveness; but it is a failure that is widely shared in Europe.
When the financial crisis erupted in the fourth quarter of 2007, Italy’s GDP plummeted by 7%, then picked up by 3%, dropped again by 5%, rebounded by a measly 0.1%, and lately, during the first half of this year, shrank again, this time by 0.3%.
Altogether, Italian GDP has contracted by 9% during the past seven years.
Industrial production, moreover, has plunged by a staggering 24%.
Only thanks to stubbornly persistent inflation has Italy’s nominal GDP managed to remain constant.
Overall unemployment has climbed to 12%, while the rate for youth not attending school has soared to 44%.
Italy has tried to counteract the economic contraction by increasing its public debt.
With the European Central Bank and intergovernmental rescue operations keeping interest rates low, Italy’s public debt has been able to rise by one-third from the end of 2007 to the spring of 2014.
Italy’s new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, wants to stimulate growth.
But what he really intends to do is accumulate even more debt.
True, debt spurs demand; but this type of demand is artificial and short-lived.
Sustainable growth can be achieved only if Italy’s economy regains its competitiveness, and within the eurozone there is only one way to accomplish this: by reducing the prices of its goods relative to those of its eurozone competitors.
What Italy managed in the past by devaluing the lira must now be emulated through so-called real depreciation.
The era of low interest rates that followed the decision in 1995 to introduce the euro inflated a massive credit bubble in southern eurozone countries, which was sustained until the end of 2013.
During this time, Italy became 25% more expensive (on the basis of its GDP deflator) than its eurozone trading partners.
Seventeen percentage points of this rise can be accounted for by higher inflation, and eight percentage points through a revaluation of the lira conducted prior to the introduction of the euro.
Relative to Germany, Italy became a whopping 42% more expensive.
That price differential – and nothing else – is Italy’s problem.
There is no other solution for the country than to correct this imbalance by means of real depreciation.
But accomplishing that is easier said than done.
Raising prices is almost never a real problem.
Lowering them or making them rise more slowly than prices in competing countries is painful and unnerving.
Even if a country’s trade unions enable such a policy through wage moderation, debtors would run into difficulties, because they borrowed on the assumption that high inflation would continue.
Many companies and households would go bankrupt.
Given that disinflation or deflation leads through a valley of tears before competitiveness improves, there is reason to doubt whether election-minded politicians, with their short-term orientation, are capable of staying the course.
Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi wanted to solve the problem by withdrawing Italy from the eurozone and devaluing the new currency.
He conducted exploratory conversations with other eurozone governments in the autumn of 2011, and had sought an agreement with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, who proposed a referendum that effectively would have meant choosing between strict austerity and exiting the eurozone.
But both leaders had to resign, only three days apart, in November 2011.
Higher political considerations, as well as the interests of the banking system, militated against an exit.
The economist Mario Monti, who followed Berlusconi as Prime Minister, attempted a real depreciation, introducing greater flexibility into the labor market in order to force the unions into wage concessions.
But Monti’s efforts came to naught; among other problems, the ECB, with its generous financial help, removed the pressure from both unions and companies.
Enrico Letta, who followed Monti as the head of Italy’s government, lacked a clear concept for reform, and in turn was followed by the charismatic Renzi.
But, though Renzi expends much verbal energy on the economy, so far he has given no indication that he understands the nature of Italy’s problem.
Renzi is not alone in this.
On the contrary, virtually the entire European political elite, from Brussels to Paris to Berlin, still believes that Europe is suffering from a mere financial and confidence crisis.
The underlying loss of competitiveness is not discussed, because that is a problem that discussion alone cannot resolve.
Free-Trade Pitfalls
MUNICH − The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, currently the subject of intense negotiations between the European Union and the United States, is making big waves.
Indeed, given the scale of the two economies, which together account for more than 50% of world GDP and one-third of global trade flows, the stakes are high.
In order to ensure that the TTIP benefits consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, those negotiating it must recognize and avoid several key traps – some more obvious than others.
Bilateral trade agreements have been gaining traction lately.
For example, the EU and Canada recently concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which is likely to become the basis for the TTIP.
This is not surprising, given the repeated failure of attempts to reach a global agreement via the World Trade Organization.
The Doha Round of WTO talks was a flop, and the agreement reached in Bali last year, despite being sold as a success, does little more than accelerate the collection of customs duties.
As it stands, fear of insufficient consumer protection, distorted by vested interests, is dominating the TTIP debate.
Consider the disagreement over the differing treatment of chicken.
In the US, chicken meat is washed in chlorinated water; in Europe, chickens are stuffed with antibiotics while alive.
In an effort that can be described only as absurd, European producers are attempting to convince their customers that the former method is worse for consumers.
In reality, consumer protection in the US is considerably better and stricter than in the EU, where, following the European Court of Justice’s Cassis de Dijon decision, the minimum standard applicable to all countries is set by the country with the lowest standard in each case.
By contrast, the US Food and Drug Administration enforces the highest product standards, meaning that, under the TTIP, European consumers would gain access to higher-quality products at lower prices.
The main benefit of trade facilitation is that it enables countries to specialize in the areas in which they are most capable.
As Ralph Ossa showed in a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research, if Germany did not have access to international markets, its standard of living would be half of what it is now.
The TTIP, according to the Ifo Institute’s Gabriel Felbermayr, could improve German living standards by 3-5%.
But these benefits are far from guaranteed.
One major risk of trade facilitation is trade diversion – that is, a reduction in customs duties between two countries leads consumers to avoid less expensive products from third countries.
If consumer savings do not outweigh the decline in countries’ customs revenue, the end result is reduced welfare.
Avoiding such an outcome requires provisions enabling a wider set of countries, in particular China and Russia, to participate in the trade-facilitation process on equal terms.
Indeed, building a sort of “economic NATO” that excludes powers like Russia and China would be inadvisable both economically and politically.
Instead, these countries should be included in the negotiation process.
Another potential risk concerns investment protection.
As it stands, it is acceptable for the EU to assume responsibility when its own health and environmental-protection measures function as de facto trade barriers.
EU directives capping the CO2 emissions of cars, for example, are actually a kind of industrial policy aimed at protecting small French and Italian automobiles.
Investment protection would limit this kind of abuse.
But it is not acceptable for the EU to offer foreign investors protection from a European country’s inability to meet its obligations, in particular to service its debt.
Such a move, as Handelsblatt’s Norbert Häring recently pointed out, would transform the TTIP into a mechanism for mutualizing liability within the EU.
EU-wide investment guarantees would artificially reduce the rate of interest under which single EU countries could borrow and thus encourage these countries to take on more debt, effectively suspending the self-correcting mechanism of the capital markets.
That would lead to the next act in the European debt disaster, with consequences that far outweigh the TTIP’s benefits.
The TTIP undoubtedly has considerable potential to boost economic performance on both sides of the Atlantic.
But it will mean nothing if the agreement is allowed to serve as a back door to European debt mutualization through what effectively might come close to Eurobonds.
Europe’s Next Moral Hazard
MUNICH – The euro crisis has passed through six phases so far.
It is worth recalling them, because they show how policymakers stumbled along, trying to put out fires without keeping an eye on where their chosen path was leading them.
Currently, markets remain calm, but this is only the beginning of a seventh phase of the crisis, during which Europe will become mired in debt.
The sequence so far has been as follows:
The limiting of creditors’ and investors’ liability to a mere 8% of the balance-sheet total of banks in the context of Europe’s new banking union – a measure aimed at ensuring more private international lending to stricken banks.
The seventh phase of the crisis is one of enhanced moral hazard, stemming from a run-up in debt.
With investment risks largely collectivized by the bailout measures instituted by the ECB and the eurozone’s member governments, investors are once again accepting low yields, and borrowers are seizing the new opportunities.
To be sure, in 2011 a so-called fiscal compact was agreed in order to avoid precisely this consequence.
The compact, signed by all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic, obliges governments among other things to reduce their (smoothed) debt/GDP ratio annually by one-twentieth of the difference between the actual debt/GDP ratio and the Maastricht limit of 60%.
However, the exceptions foreseen in the compact have effectively removed theses constraints.
Had the compact been enforced, Italy would have had to reduce its debt/GDP ratio from 121% in 2011 to 112% in 2014.
Instead, Italy’s debt ratio has skyrocketed, with a forecast by the European Commission projecting it to reach 134% at the end of this year.
	Likewise, Spain’s debt ratio should have fallen from 71% to 69%, but will probably increase to 99%.
Greece’s debt ratio will rise from 170% to 177% (despite a 58-percentage-point debt-relief scheme in 2012), Portugal’s will surge from 108% to 127%, and France’s will rise from 86% to 96%.
But, instead of ruefully admitting their failures, the governments in question are now going on the offensive by rejecting austerity categorically.
Italy’s new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, came to power on that platform.
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is trying to counter his leftist rival Alexis Tsipras in the same way.
Portugal’s Constitutional Court has thwarted the country’s fiscal-consolidation efforts.
And France’s new prime minister, Manuel Valls, is also moving against austerity.
Supposedly, everyone just wants more growth; unfortunately, when politicians talk about growth, what they usually mean is that they should be permitted to incur more public debt.
	An increase in public debt causes a short-term surge in demand, helping to increase the degree of capacity utilization and keep unemployment in check.
However, new debt is nothing but a form of dope, reducing pressure to take painful measures that would improve competitiveness and capacity growth.
de facto debt mutualization that has prompted creditors to accept lower interest rates, and it is only lower interest rates that have permitted Renzi, Samaras, Valls, and the others to distance themselves from austerity policies.
	There is nothing surprising about this: When a decision-maker can claim full credit for a policy’s benefits and collectivize the costs, he will pursue the policy sooner, more quickly, and to a larger extent than he would if he had to bear the costs alone.
What is remarkable is how matter-of-factly Europe’s transgressors succeed in cloaking themselves with the mantle of a new social breakthrough.
One only needs to look at the United States to see how dangerous – and indeed unsustainable – the eurozone’s path has become.
When one of the US states runs up too much debt, creditors become jittery and austerity measures are introduced to avert the risk of bankruptcy – as has happened in the past few years in California, Illinois, and Minnesota.
	But all of that occurs while the debt/GDP ratio is still minimal and clearly below 10%, because creditors know that no one will come to their aid.
The Federal Reserve will not buy their government bonds, and the federal authorities will not issue any guarantees.
In Europe, by contrast, easy access to the local printing presses before and after the foundation of the ECB, together with the new fiscal rescue mechanisms, ensure that investors start to become nervous only when debt ratios are 10-20 times as high.
As a result, the debt level rises until it spirals out of control.
	The critical limit beyond which creditors become anxious has been raised significantly by the bailout architecture put in place over the last two years.
This will bring a few years of calm as debt levels climb steadily to that limit.
Then the storm will come, battering ordinary citizens, while today’s leaders remain high and dry, drawing pensions.
Happiness, Money, and Giving It Away
Would you be happier if you were richer?
Many people believe that they would be.
But research conducted over many years suggests that greater wealth implies greater happiness only at quite low levels of income.
People in the United States, for example, are, on average, richer than New Zealanders, but they are not happier.
More dramatically, people in Austria, France, Japan, and Germany appear to be no happier than people in much poorer countries, like Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines.
Comparisons between countries with different cultures are difficult, but the same effect appears within countries, except at very low income levels, such as below $12,000 annually for the US.
Beyond that point, an increase in income doesn’t make a lot of difference to people’s happiness.
Americans are richer than they were in the 1950’s, but they are not happier.
Americans in the middle-income range today – that is, a family income of $50,000-$90,000 – have a level of happiness that is almost identical to well-off Americans, with a family income of more than $90,000.
Most surveys of happiness simply ask people how satisfied they are with their lives.
We cannot place great confidence in such studies, because this kind of overall “life satisfaction” judgment may not reflect how much people really enjoy the way they spend their time.
My Princeton University colleague Daniel Kahneman and several co-researchers tried to measure people’s subjective well-being by asking them about their mood at frequent intervals during a day.
In an article published in Science on June 30, they report that their data confirm that there is little correlation between income and happiness.
On the contrary, Kahneman and his colleagues found that people with higher incomes spent more time in activities that are associated with negative feelings, such as tension and stress.
Instead of having more time for leisure, they spent more time at and commuting to work.
They were more often in moods that they described as hostile, angry, anxious, and tense.
Of course, there is nothing new in the idea that money does not buy happiness.
Many religions instruct us that attachment to material possessions makes us unhappy.
The Beatles reminded us that money can’t buy us love.
Even Adam Smith, who told us that it is not from the butcher’s benevolence that we get our dinner, but from his regard for his self-interest, described the imagined pleasures of wealth as “a deception” (though one that “rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind”).
Nevertheless, there is something paradoxical about this.
Why do governments all focus on increasing per capita national income?
Why do so many of us strive to obtain more money, if it won’t make us happier?
Perhaps the answer lies in our nature as purposive beings.
We evolved from beings who had to work hard to feed themselves, find a mate, and raise children.
For nomadic societies, there was no point in owning anything that one could not carry, but once humans settled down and developed a system of money, that limit to acquisition disappeared.
Accumulating money up to a certain amount provides a safeguard against lean times, but today it has become an end in itself, a way of measuring one’s status or success, and a goal to fall back on when we can think of no other reason for doing anything, but would be bored doing nothing.
Making money gives us something to do that feels worthwhile, as long as we do not reflect too much on why we are doing it.
Consider, in this light, the life of the American investor Warren Buffett.
For 50 years, Buffett, now 75, has worked at accumulating a vast fortune.
According to Forbes magazine , he is the second wealthiest person in the world, after Bill Gates, with assets of $42 billion.
Yet his frugal lifestyle shows that he does not particularly enjoy spending large amounts of money.
Even if his tastes were more lavish, he would be hard-pressed to spend more than a tiny fraction of his wealth.
From this perspective, once Buffett earned his first few millions in the 1960’s, his efforts to accumulate more money can easily seem completely pointless.
Is Buffett a victim of the “deception” that Adam Smith described, and that Kahneman and his colleagues have studied in more depth?
Coincidentally, Kahneman’s article appeared the same week that Buffett announced the largest philanthropic donation in US history – $30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and another $7 billion to other charitable foundations.
Even when the donations made by Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller are adjusted for inflation, Buffett’s is greater.
At a single stroke, Buffett has given purpose to his life.
Since he is an agnostic, his gift is not motivated by any belief that it will benefit him in an afterlife.
What, then, does Buffett’s life tell us about the nature of happiness?
Perhaps, as Kahneman’s research would lead us to expect, Buffett spent less of his life in a positive mood than he would have if, at some point in the 1960’s, he had quit working, lived on his assets, and played a lot more bridge.
But, in that case, he surely would not have experienced the satisfaction that he can now rightly feel at the thought that his hard work and remarkable investment skills will, through the Gates Foundation, help to cure diseases that cause death and disability to billions of the world’s poorest people.
Buffett reminds us that there is more to happiness than being in a good mood.
The Political Logic of Hard Brexit
PARIS – Little more than three months after the United Kingdom’s decision in June to leave the European Union, Brexit politics are careening out of control in the UK.
An almost revolutionary – and very un-British – dynamic has taken hold, and, as British Prime Minister Theresa May indicated in her “Little Englander” speech at the Conservative Party conference this month, the UK is heading for a “hard Brexit.”
That outcome would run counter to British public opinion, which remains moderate on the question of fully breaking with the EU.
According to a July BBC/ComRes poll, 66% of respondents considered “maintaining access to the single market” to be more important than restricting freedom of movement.
In an ICM poll the same month, only 10% of respondents said they would prioritize ending free movement over maintaining access to the single market, while 30% viewed the two as equally important and 38% considered maintaining full access to the single market the priority.
These findings will surprise only those who buy into the narrative that the West is confronting a large-scale xenophobic revolt against the elites.
While the “Leave” camp certainly included many hard Brexiteers whose primary motivation was to end free movement, it also comprised people who believed Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and current foreign secretary, when he promised (as he still does) that the UK could have its cake and eat it.
In fact, despite Leave’s large faction of angry white working-class voters, middle-class trade-friendly Brexiteers, together with the “Remain” camp, constitute a clear majority of everyone who voted in the June referendum.
Under normal circumstances, one would expect the government’s policy to reflect the majority’s preference, and to aim for a “soft Brexit.”
Instead, a classic revolutionary pattern has emerged.
According to the Brexiteers, the people have spoken, and it is the government’s duty to deliver a “true” Brexit.
But the government must overcome the spoilers, such as senior civil servants and the Remain majority in the House of Commons, who favor a Brexit in name only – a “false” version that could never deliver the benefits of the real thing.
In this revolutionary narrative, the worst elements of Europe’s political tradition have crowded out British pragmatism.
What a majority of British voters want is considered irrelevant.
With a hard Brexit, the Leave camp can avoid being seen by voters as the supplicant in negotiations with the EU – which it inevitably would be, no matter how often May denies it.
The EU will have the upper hand in negotiations for two simple reasons.
First, the UK has more to lose economically.
While other EU countries’ total exports to the UK are double what the UK exports to the rest of the bloc, its exports to the EU amount to three times more as a share of its GDP.
Likewise, the UK has a services surplus, which matters far less to the rest of the EU than it does to Britain.
Second, just like the EU’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, any negotiated arrangement between the EU and the UK will have to be unanimously accepted by all EU member states.
Thus, the negotiation will not really be between the UK and the EU, but rather among EU members.
The UK, without a presence at those talks, will simply have to accept or reject whatever the EU offers.
This would be true even if the UK pursued a prepackaged arrangement such as membership in the European Economic Area or the EU Customs Union; it will be all the more true if the UK seeks a “bespoke” deal, as May has indicated she will.
If British voters recognized their country’s weak negotiating position, the Brexiteers, who won the referendum on their promise to “take back control,” would face a political disaster.
Walking away from substantive negotiations is the simplest way to avoid such an embarrassing unmasking.
Thus, politically, a hard Brexit is actually the soft option for the government.
Economically, however, hard Brexit will come at a high price, which the UK will have to pay for years to come.
The only consolation is that Brexit’s revolutionary momentum may not be sustainable.
Shortly after the Leave camp labeled bureaucrats in her Her Majesty’s Civil Service “enemies of the people” – a typical statement in the early stages of a revolution – pro-Brexit Foreign Trade Minister Liam Fox derided British exporters, calling them “too lazy and too fat” to succeed in his brave new free-trading Britain.
Such rhetoric is a symptom of desperation.
It carries echoes of the declining years of the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, when Marxist apologists insisted that there was nothing wrong with communism, except that humanity wasn’t yet mature enough for it.
If developments continue at this pace, the revolutionary zeal we see among British politicians may burn itself out before “hard Brexit” is consummated.
Hard Financial Questions about Soft Development Money
Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) by 2015 is a tremendous challenge facing the international community, and there is widespread agreement that additional external aid is required to meet it.
So the question now is not whether to increase aid, but how best to finance it.
The search for additional and more stable funding to meet the MDG’s has led to various proposals for innovative financing mechanisms and debt relief, in particular by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.
But the broad range of proposed schemes to bolster resources for development assistance raises hard questions about the appropriate balance between objective needs and sound and effective financing.
Donors as well as recipients must ensure consistency between financing and absorptive capacity.
They must also ensure that additional official financing and debt relief will not distort incentives or create moral hazard.
New money should go to good performers, not just to those who are experiencing debt distress.
In addition to these issues, financing proposals to achieve the MDG’s should be discussed from a central banker’s perspective.
The best solutions include sufficient increases in rich countries’ foreign aid allocations and more ambitious trade liberalization.
But such policies seem politically untenable in the short term, even though – according to the World Bank’s estimation – an appropriate conclusion of the current trade round under the auspices of the World Trade Organization could contribute $350 billion a year to developing countries by 2015.
Similarly, when it comes to increasing foreign-aid budgets, politicians want solutions that are not “felt” by taxpayers (that is, voters) and that can remain outside of national budgets.
However, opaque solutions designed to avoid critical public scrutiny do not seem particularly democratic.
“Innovative” financing solutions might also undermine the clear assignment of responsibilities for raising and using public money.
Indeed, the term “innovative financing mechanism” conjures the idea that there is an easy way to meet the MDG’s.
But, in the end, there are only three ways to secure additional financing for development aid or debt relief: higher taxes, increased indebtedness (that is, higher taxes for future generations), and/or monetary expansion.
One proposal calls for taxing national and international financial transactions.
Others call for allocating Special Drawing Rights (SDR’s) from the IMF, or for using the IMF’s gold resources.
But none of them appears desirable.
To be effective, any tax on financial transactions would have to be implemented on a global scale, which currently does not seem realistic.
Moreover, taxation would increase costs (passed on to borrowers) and reduce the volume of transactions, thereby fueling market volatility amid decreasing liquidity.
Allocating new SDR’s also is inappropriate.
Above all, SDR’s represent liquidity and can be allocated only if and when there is a “global need,” which would currently be difficult to prove given highly liquid and “easy” international capital-market conditions.
Even if a “global need” were recognized, SDR’s, as a component of countries’ official foreign-exchange reserves, should not be available for budgetary spending.
Financing development aid with SDR’s – or even to replace budget-financed aid with such allocations – is comparable to financing budget deficits with central bank money.
In any case, new SDR allocations require the support of 85% of votes within the IMF’s board, which appears unachievable in the foreseeable future, as major shareholders are opposed.
Even the special one-time issuance of SDR’s, agreed upon in 1997 to ensure that all Fund members receive an “equitable” share of cumulative SDR allocations, has still not been activated, owing to insurmountable opposition.
Finally, the proposed “better use” of the IMF’s gold holdings to finance the costs of debt relief seeks to raise up to $8 billion.
At the current market price, this would require selling about a quarter of the Fund’s holdings of 103.4 million fine ounces.
However, these reserves represent an important “hidden” asset that lends strength to the Fund’s balance sheet.
The IMF’s creditors consider it a necessary safeguard against increased risks in the Fund’s credit portolio.
This is because the Fund has experienced exceptionally high access and prolonged use of its resources by a few large economies in the last decade.
Moreover, the IMF’s share in crisis countries’ total external debt has reached unprecedented and systemically problematic levels.
As a result of both tendencies, there is a high concentration of credits on a few large borrowers.
To use IMF gold for further debt relief in the face of increased risk threatens the Fund’s financial integrity and contradicts the recent decision to increase the IMF’s precautionary balances.
Development aid has to be financed in “real terms,” or in a reputable manner, not by spending central bank money or by jeopardizing the IMF’s financial integrity.
Aid should preferably be financed out of donor countries’ national budgets in a transparent, democratically accountable way.
“Innovative” must not become a euphemism for non-transparent, ineffective, or unsound.
Hard Truths About Global Growth
NEW YORK – The world’s high-income countries are in economic trouble, mostly related to growth and employment, and now their distress is spilling over to developing economies.
What factors underlie today’s problems, and how appropriate are the likely policy responses?
The first key factor is deleveraging and the resulting shortfall in aggregate demand.
Since the financial crisis began in 2008, several developed countries, having sustained demand with excessive leverage and consumption, have had to repair both private and public balance sheets, which takes time – and has left them impaired in terms of growth and employment.
The non-tradable side of any advanced economy is large (roughly two-thirds of total activity).
For this large sector, there is no substitute for domestic demand.
The tradable side could make up some of the deficit, but it is not large enough to compensate fully.
In principle, governments could bridge the gap, but high (and rising) debt constrains their capacity to do so (though how constrained is a matter of heated debate).
The bottom line is that deleveraging will ensure that growth will be modest at best in the short and medium term.
If Europe deteriorates, or there is gridlock in dealing with America’s “fiscal cliff” at the beginning of 2013 (when tax cuts expire and automatic spending cuts kick in), a major downturn will become far more likely.
The second factor underlying today’s problems relates to investment.
Longer-term growth requires investment by individuals (in education and skills), governments, and the private sector.
Shortfalls in investment eventually diminish growth and employment opportunities.
The hard truth is that the flip side of the consumption-led growth model that prevailed prior to the crisis has been deficient investment, particularly on the public-sector side.
If fiscal rebalancing is accomplished in part by cutting investment, medium- and longer-term growth will suffer, resulting in fewer employment opportunities for younger labor-market entrants.
Sustaining investment, on the other hand, has an immediate cost: it means deferring consumption.
But whose consumption?
If almost everyone agrees that more investment is needed to elevate and sustain growth, but most believe that someone else should pay for it, investment will fall victim to a burden-sharing impasse – reflected in the political process, electoral choices, and the formulation of fiscal-stabilization measures.
The core issue is taxes.
If public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation, the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would bein implausibly large.
The most difficult challenge concerns inclusiveness – how the benefits of growth are to be distributed.
This is a longstanding challenge that, particularly in the United States, goes back at least two decades before the crisis; left unaddressed, it now threatens social cohesion.
Income growth for the middle class in most advanced countries has been stagnant, and employment opportunities have been declining, especially in the tradable part of the economy.
The share of income going to capital has been rising, at the expense of labor.
Particularly in the US, employment generation has been disproportionately in the non-tradable sector.
These trends reflect a combination of technological and global market forces that have been operating over the last two decades.
On the technology side, labor-saving innovations in network-based information processing and transactions automation have helped to drive a wedge between growth and employment generation in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors.
In the tradable part of advanced economies, manufacturing automation – including expanding robotic capabilities and, prospectively, 3D printing – has combined with the integration of millions of new entrants into rapidly evolving global supply chains to limit employment growth.
Multinational companies’ growing ability to decompose these global supply chains by function and geography, and then to reintegrate them at ever lower transaction costs, removes the labor-market protection that used to come from local competition for workers.
This challenge is particularly difficult, because economic policy has not focused primarily on the adverse distributional trends arising from shifting global market outcomes.
And yet the income distributions across advanced economies, presumably subject to similar technological and global market forces, are, in fact, startlingly different, suggesting that a combination of social policies and differing social norms does have a distributional impact.
Although the theory of optimal income taxation directly addresses the tradeoffs between efficiency incentives and distributional consequences, the appropriate equilibrium remains a long way off.
A healthy state balance sheet could help, because part of the income flowing to capital would go to the state.
But, with the exception of China, fiscal positions around the world are currently weak.
As a result, deleveraging remains a clear priority in a range of countries, reducing growth, with fiscal countermeasures limited by high or rising government debt and deficits.
Thus far, there is little evidence of willingness on the part of politicians, policymakers, and perhaps the public to reduce current consumption further via taxation in order to create room for expanded growth-oriented investment.
In fact, under fiscal pressure, the opposite is more likely.
In the US, few practical measures that address the distributional challenge appear to be part of either major party’s electoral agenda, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary.
To the extent that this is true of other advanced economies, the global economy faces an extended multi-year period of low growth, with residual downside risk coming from policy gridlock and mistakes in Europe, the US, and elsewhere.
That scenario implies slower growth – possibly 1-1.5 percentage points slower – in developing countries, including China, again with a preponderance of downside risk.
Hard Turkey
JERUSALEM – The recent surge in Turkey’s military actions against the Kurds in northern Iraq is an indication that, somewhat surprisingly – but not entirely unpredictably – Turkish foreign policy has undergone a 180-degree turn in less than two years.
The Turkish offensive is also an indication that these changes go beyond the current tensions between Turkey and Israel, which are just one facet of much deeper trends.
Just a couple of years ago, after the European Union slammed the door in Turkey’s face (despite some significant military and penal reforms by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government), Turkey re-oriented its policy away from Europe towards its immediate region.
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu’s “zero conflicts with neighbors” approach gave this re-orientation its strategic and theoretical foundation.
Opening an impressive new page, Turkey reached out to Armenia; softened its position on Cyprus; tried to draw Iran into a positive dialogue with the West; convinced Syria to settle the two countries’ simmering border dispute; and, as a crowning achievement, launched peace talks between Syria and Israel under Turkish mediation.
Yet these good-neighborhood policies did not work out as intended.
Rapprochement with Armenia stalled; no significant progress was made on Cyprus, especially after a less-accommodating leader was elected in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (an entity that only Turkey recognizes); the opening to Iran did not soften the mullahs’ position on nuclear development (and strained relations with the United States); the Syria-Israel talks failed; and Turkey’s participation in the 2010 flotilla to Gaza, and Israel’s brutal response to it, signaled an end to decades of close Israeli-Turkish cooperation.
To top it all off, Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, ostensibly Turkey’s closest new ally, emerged as the most oppressive and bloody regional tyrant.
Assad has now spent the better part of 2011 killing his own people as they demonstrate for liberalization and reform.
Notwithstanding these failures, Turkey’s strategic stature did not suffer, partly because the diminution of US engagement under President Barack Obama enabled Turkey to fill the ensuing regional power vacuum.
The Arab Spring, despite its still-inconclusive outcome, greatly weakened Egypt’s role in regional politics and made it possible for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to position Turkey – and himself – as the leader of a Muslim bloc and a model of co-existence between Islam and democracy.
Last but not least, the AKP’s victory in recent parliamentary elections has encouraged Erdoğan to embrace Putinesque ambitions.
All of this exposed the built-in ambivalence in Davutoğlu’s “zero conflict” policy.
While initially viewed as pacific and moderate, it was underpinned by an overarching view of Turkey as the hegemonic regional power – as an arbiter of conflicts, but ultimately also as an enforcer of its own views on lesser players.
It may be incorrect to call Turkey’s behavior “neo-Ottoman,” but some neighboring countries, after expecting a mediator and facilitator, may now feel faced by a possible bully.
Erdoğan’s policy re-orientation vis-à-vis Israel can be understood as an attempt not only to overcome traditional Arab suspicion of Turkey, given its imperial past, but also to present a more moderate Islamic alternative to theocratic Iran and its unpredictable president.
But Erdoğan’s threat to consider using the Turkish navy as a military escort for further flotillas to Gaza already borders on saber rattling, as does his declared willingness to use force to prevent the Republic of Cyprus from exploring for gas in its continental shelf.
Indeed, Erdoğan’s has warned of a diplomatic rupture with the EU if Cyprus accedes to the Union’s rotating presidency in 2012.
At the same time, renewed violent incursions into northern Iraq in pursuit of alleged guerillas suggest a reversion to hardline anti-Kurdish policies.
The withdrawal of US forces from Iraq only seems to have encouraged Turkey’s will to create a cordon sanitaire on the Iraqi side of the border – and possibly to establish a counterweight to Iran’s influence on a Shia-led government in Baghdad.
And, while Turkey’s agreement to host NATO anti-missile radar facilities, and its recent seizure of a Syrian-registered arms ship, may please the West, here, too, its policies are focused on “hard” military power.
Similarly, Erdoğan’s recent visit to Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia brings out the ambivalence of Turkey’s new claim to regional hegemony.
While Egypt’s shaky military junta welcomed Erdoğan, many Egyptians were not happy about his hectoring them – and other Arabs – to follow Turkish policies and to regard Turkey as their Muslim leader.
A new sultanate?
Erdoğan as the new Saladin?
Turkey has an enormously important role to play in the region.
It could be a bridge between the West and the East, between Islam and modernity, and between Israel and the Arabs.
But it runs the danger of succumbing to the arrogance of power, which has corrupted and sidelined many strong states in the past.
What Enabled Bretton Woods?
PRINCETON – The proximity of the 70th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference, which established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to historical anniversaries like the Allied landings in Normandy highlights just how ambitious its organizers were.
Indeed, amid considerable tumult, the conference aimed to create a stable international monetary framework that could serve as a cornerstone of a peaceful global order.
And it succeeded – at least for a while.
Bretton Woods retains a powerful fascination, with at least three recent books on the subject having achieved considerable commercial success.
What makes an event in which a group of mostly men talk about money so intriguing?
Of course, there are some juicy incidentals, such as the dance of John Maynard Keynes’s wife, a Russian ballerina, that kept the US Treasury Secretary awake, and charges of espionage for the Soviet Union against the main American negotiator, Harry Dexter White.
But the real drama of the conference lay in the systematic evolution of an institutional structure that underpinned global stability and prosperity for at least three decades.
The institutional vision was linked to a global security system.
Indeed, in the original agreement, the five large powers that would be represented permanently on the IMF Executive Board were the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, and France – the same countries with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.
Even within this framework, the negotiations were challenging.
So how did 44 disparate powers, each seeking to protect its own national interests, manage to agree on a new global monetary system?
According to Keynes, the key was a process of international deliberation and planning, led by “a single power or like-minded group of powers.”
By contrast, a 66-country “pow-wow” like the abortive World Economic Conference, held in London in 1933, could never be expected to produce an agreement.
Keynes’s rival, Friedrich Hayek, went further, asserting that a successful, enduring order could not be negotiated at all; it had to be spontaneous.
The experience at Bretton Woods lends significant credence to Keynes’s assessment.
While 44 countries were formally represented at Bretton Woods, the UK and especially the US were the dominant players.
In fact, bilateral negotiations have enabled every major success of large-scale financial diplomacy.
In the early 1970s, when the fixed exchange-rate regime established at Bretton Woods collapsed, the IMF seemed to have outlived its function.
But, by renegotiating the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, the US, seeking greater flexibility, and France, which sought the kind of predictability that the gold standard had provided, were able to revive it.
Later that decade, efforts by France, Germany, and the UK to confer on monetary policy failed miserably.
But discussions between France and Germany – which remain the leading voices in debates on European monetary issues – were far more effective.
Likewise, in the mid-1980s, when exchange-rate volatility gave rise to calls for protectionist trade measures, the US and Japan found a solution involving exchange-rate stabilization.
Nowadays, international economic diplomacy is centered on the US and China.
In recent years, an emerging debate has focused on whether the global economic system of the 2000s – in which export-oriented emerging economies essentially pegged their currencies to the dollar to obtain faster growth and accumulate foreign-exchange reserves at spectacular rates – effectively created a sort of “Bretton Woods II.”
Could China and the US formalize such a system, with the renminbi playing a greater role?
The bilateral nature of the negotiations certainly implies that they have a chance.
But there was another critical factor underpinning the success of the Bretton Woods conference: the global political and security environment.
For starters, the conference occurred the month after the D-Day landings in Normandy, when the end of World War II seemed far closer than it turned out to be.
There were also domestic considerations at work.
As US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. stated in advance of the conference, “We felt that it was good for the world, good for the nation, and good for the Democratic Party, for us to move.”
In order to achieve an agreement of similar scale and influence, world leaders – especially in the US and China – would need to be under similarly high pressure.
A global pact would have to be an urgent necessity, rather than an attractive possibility.
What would convince Chinese leaders that they must rapidly reinforce the open global economy that enabled China’s export-driven economic rise?
One such catalyst might be a financial crisis emanating from the country’s risk-laden shadow-banking system.
A contest for global leadership might serve that purpose as well.
Or perhaps the stimulus will be fear that the world is sliding toward protectionism, with bilateral and regional trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deepening divisions between their participants and the rest of the world.
Bretton Woods demonstrated that it takes a major crisis to produce a political dynamic of reform.
Today’s world, for all of its troubles, is simply not dangerous enough – at least not yet – for the countries at the helm of the global economy.
Who Should Lead the Global Economy?
PRINCETON – In terms of global economic leadership, the twentieth century was American, just as the nineteenth century was British and the sixteenth century was Spanish.
Some Chinese and Europeans think that they are next.
Are they?
And should they even want to be?
The most important prerequisite for global economic leadership is size.
The bigger an economy, the greater its systemic importance, and the more leverage its political representatives have in international decision-making.
The United States is the world’s largest economy, with a GDP of roughly $16.7 trillion.
The eurozone’s $12.6 trillion output puts it in second place, and China, with a GDP of around $9 trillion, comes in third.
In other words, all three economies are conceivably large enough to serve as global economic leaders.
But an economy’s future prospects are also crucial to its leadership prospects – and serious challenges lie ahead.
No one thinks that the eurozone will grow more quickly than the US in the coming years or decades.
While China is expected to overtake the US in terms of output by 2020, decades of rigid population-control measures will weaken growth in the longer run, leaving the US economy as the most dynamic of the three.
Another key requirement for global economic leadership is systemic importance in commercial, monetary, and financial terms.
Unlike China, a large trade power with underdeveloped monetary and financial capabilities, the eurozone meets the requirement of systemic significance in all three areas.
There is also a less concrete aspect to leadership.
Being a true global leader means shaping and connecting the global economic structures within which states and markets operate – something the US has been doing for almost 70 years.
At the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, the US crafted the post-World War II international monetary and financial order.
The basic framework, centered around the US dollar, has survived financial crises, the Soviet Union’s dissolution, and several developing countries’ integration into the world economy.
Today, American leadership in global trade and financial and monetary governance rests on inter-related strengths.
The US provides the world’s key international currency, serves as the linchpin of global demand, establishes trends in financial regulation, and has a central bank that acts as the world’s de facto lender of last resort.
Beyond delivering a global public good, supplying the world’s central currency carries substantial domestic benefits.
Because the US can borrow and pay for imports in its own currency, it does not face a hard balance-of-payments constraint.
This has allowed it to run large and sustained current-account deficits fairly consistently since the early 1980’s.
These deficits raise persistent concerns about the system’s viability, with observers (mostly outside the US) having long predicted its imminent demise.
But the system survives, because it is based on a functional trade-off, in which the US uses other countries’ money to act as the main engine of global demand.
In fact, export-oriented economies like Germany, Japan, and China owe much of their success to America’s capacity to absorb a massive share of global exports – and they need to keep paying America to play this role.
Given this, the big exporters have lately come under intense pressure to “correct” their external surpluses as part of responsible global citizenship.
While this has contributed to a sharp contraction of the Chinese and Japanese surpluses, the eurozone’s current-account surplus is growing, with the International Monetary Fund expecting it to reach 2.3% of GDP this year (slightly less than the Chinese surplus).
A global economy led by a surplus country seems more logical, given that creditors usually dictate terms.
At the time of the Bretton Woods conference, the US accounted for more than half of the world’s manufactured output.
The rest of the world needed dollars that only the US could supply.
Chinese or European leadership would probably look more like the pre-World War I Pax Britannica (during which the United Kingdom supplied capital to the rest of the world in anticipation of its own relative economic decline), with the hegemon supplying funds on a long-term basis.
But this scenario presupposes a deep and well-functioning financial system to intermediate the funds – something that China and the eurozone have been unable to achieve.
Despite the 2008 financial crisis, the US remains the undisputed leader in global finance.
Indeed, American financial markets boast unparalleled depth, liquidity, and safety, making them magnets for global capital, especially in times of financial distress.
This “pulling power,” central to US financial dominance, underpins the dollar’s global role, as investors in search of safe, liquid assets pour money into US Treasury securities.
The belief that a common currency and a common capital market would buttress financial institutions and deepen markets was a driving principle behind the eurozone’s formation.
But, given the lack of a single debt instrument equivalent to a US Treasury bill, the crisis caused eurozone member states’ public-debt yields to diverge.
Bank lending subsequently withdrew to national borders, and the idea of a European capital market disintegrated.
Likewise, in China, the absence of currency convertibility – together with a weak financial supervisory framework, which reflects a broader problem related to poor implementation of the rule of law – is impairing the economy’s prospects for leadership.
Europeans and Chinese should question whether they really want to assume the risks associated with a position at the center of a large and complex global financial system.
Control of the system is the chalice of global leadership; but, for economies that are not adequately prepared for it, what should be an elixir may turn out to be poison.
Soccer Lessons for Europe’s Economy
PRINCETON – Though a solution to the euro crisis continues to elude European leaders, the foundations of one are not difficult to discern.
In fact, Europe’s recent soccer experience – specifically, in the EURO 2012 tournament and this year’s World Cup – provides insight into how to revive Europe’s economy and address its deeper identity problem.
On June 28, 2012, as European political leaders met in Brussels, amid growing uncertainty about the eurozone’s survival, to negotiate the design of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), Germany was playing Italy in a semifinal match in Warsaw.
Two goals by Mario Balotelli cinched the win for Italy – and propelled Balotelli to superstar status.
At such a politically sensitive moment, a German victory could have sparked a bitter nationalist reaction in southern Europe.
Instead, encouraged by his country’s victory, Italy’s new technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti, in alliance with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, pressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel for easier access to ESM support – and scored another major victory for his country.
For a brief moment, Monti joined Balotelli in becoming a national hero.
The Italian media eagerly linked the two “Super Marios,” with photomontages showing the prime minister with the soccer player’s idiosyncratic mohawk hairstyle.
The message from both the soccer field and the negotiating room was that there was a quick and easy route to victory, complex issues could be solved by a brilliant argument, and individual superstars were the key to success.
The World Cup championship in Brazil was another matter altogether.
This time, the Germans won, with a spectacular display of power in a 7-1 semifinal erasure of the host country, Brazil, and a 1-0 triumph over Argentina in the final.
The disappointed supporters of the defeated teams viewed the games in terms of personalities.
Brazil and Argentina had long histories of superstars: Pelé, Garrincha, Ronaldo, Alfredo di Stéfano, and Diego Maradona.
In the semifinal, Brazil appeared to be paralyzed without its hero, Neymar, who wore the same number as Pelé but had been badly injured in the previous match.
In the final, Argentineans believed that the world’s best player, Lionel Messi, would surely carry the national team to victory.
Of course, the German team had plenty of good players.
But, instead of behaving like superstars, they worked together, passing consistently and creating opportunities for one another to score.
Germany’s World Cup performance was a brilliant demonstration of the importance of deep, long-term reforms.
In the early 2000s, German soccer was boring.
Germany’s heroes were from the distant past.
It was easy to draw an analogy between ineffective and mundane performance in the stadium and the general state of the country.
At the time, Germany was regarded as the sick man of Europe, with a proclivity for highly protected labor markets.
Something needed to be shaken up.
In 2004, the German national team’s new trainer, Jürgen Klinsmann, did just that.
Beyond more aggressive tactics, his radical new strategy entailed a fundamental revolution in sports education and training, with programs that identified and propelled promising young players through the teams in Germany’s domestic league.
In other words, it was a long-term strategy.
Fortunately, the team’s management understood this and persevered, despite the lack of a short-term payoff.
Klinsmann’s assistant trainer, Joachim Löw, succeeded him, and became the architect of the 2014 championship bid.
Germany’s soccer revolution was mirrored in the economy.
Beginning in 2003, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a Social Democrat, launched a series of reforms aimed at increasing labor-market flexibility and, more generally, laying the foundations for long-term prosperity.
But this future-oriented approach had serious short-term political consequences, with Schröder losing the next election and his party’s popularity diminishing considerably.
Neither Schröder nor Klinsmann attained superstar status, but they carried out the reforms that mattered.
There are other lessons that Germans and Europeans can derive from these experiences.
One concerns the integration of foreigners.
All of the major European teams, including Germany’s, depend on players of foreign descent.
In the Brazil game, Miroslav Klose, whose family hails from Poland, became the highest-scoring player in World Cup history.
The half-Ghanaian Jérôme Boateng was a pillar of the German defense.
And Mesut Özil, who is of Turkish descent, executed many beautiful sweeping passes.
Even Balotelli, Italy’s EURO 2012 superstar, is the son of Ghanaian immigrants.
But the most important lesson is that there are no quick fixes or magic bullets.
An exceptional performance by a superstar soccer player can be beautiful – even inspiring – just as rescue mechanisms and stimulus packages can rally markets and raise hopes.
But their impact is fleeting.
Consistent, reliable, long-term success requires forward-thinking measures that focus on building strong fundamentals.
Europe needs such an approach, one that includes microeconomic adjustments and programs that encourage mobility, flexibility, and innovation.
If other Europeans emulated the German model, Europe would begin to look – and play – like a championship team.
The Secret History of the Financial Crisis
PRINCETON – Balzac’s great novel Lost Illusions ends with an exposition of the difference between “official history,” which is “all lies,” and “secret history” – that is, the real story.
It used to be possible to obscure history’s scandalous truths for a long time – even forever.
Not anymore.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in accounts of the global financial crisis.
The official history portrayed the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and other major central banks as embracing coordinated action to rescue the global financial system from disaster.
But recently published transcripts of 2008 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s main decision-making body, reveal that the Fed has effectively emerged from the crisis as the world’s central bank, while continuing to serve primarily American interests.
The most significant meetings took place on September 16 and October 28 – in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers – and focused on the creation of bilateral currency-swap agreements aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity.
The Fed would extend dollar credits to a foreign bank in exchange for its currency, which the foreign bank agreed to buy back after a specified period at the same exchange rate, plus interest.
This gave central banks – especially those in Europe, which faced a dollar shortage as US investors fled – the dollars they needed to lend to struggling domestic financial institutions.
Indeed, the ECB was among the first banks to reach an agreement with the Fed, followed by other major advanced-country central banks, including the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada.
At the October meeting, four “diplomatically and economically” important emerging economies – Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, and South Korea – got in on the action, with the Fed agreeing to establish $30 billion swap lines with each of their central banks.
Though the Fed acted as a kind of global central bank, its decisions were shaped, first and foremost, by US interests.
For starters, the Fed rejected applications from some countries – whose names are redacted in the published transcript – to join the currency-swap scheme.
More important, limits were placed on the swaps.
The essence of a central bank’s lender-of-last-resort function has traditionally been the provision of unlimited funds.
Because there is no limit on the amount of dollars that the Fed can create, no market participant can take a speculative position against it.
By contrast, the International Monetary Fund has finite resources provided by member countries.
The Fed’s growing international role since 2008 reflects a fundamental shift in global monetary governance.
The IMF emerged at a time when countries were routinely victimized by New York bankers’ casual assumptions, such as J.P. Morgan’s assessment in the 1920’s that Germans were “fundamentally a second-rate people.”
The IMF was a critical feature of the post-WWII international order, intended to serve as a universal insurance mechanism – not one that could be harnessed to advance contemporary diplomatic interests.
Today, as the Fed documents clearly demonstrate, the IMF has become marginalized – not least because of its ineffective policy process.
Indeed, at the outset of the crisis, the IMF, assuming that demand for its resources would remain low permanently, had already begun to downsize.
In 2010, the IMF made a play for resurrection, presenting itself as central to solving the euro crisis – beginning with its role in financing the Greek bailout.
But here, too, a secret history has been revealed – one that highlights just how skewed global monetary governance has become.
The fact is that only the US and the massively over-represented countries of the European Union supported the Greek bailout.
Indeed, the major emerging economies all strongly opposed it, with the Brazilian representative calling it “a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions.”
Even the Swiss representative condemned the measure.
As fears of a sudden collapse of the eurozone have given way to a prolonged debate about how the costs will be met through bail-ins and write-offs, the IMF’s position will become increasingly convoluted.
Though the IMF is supposed to have seniority over other creditors, there will be demands to write down a share of the loans that it has issued.
Poorer emerging-market countries would resist such a move, arguing that their citizens should not have to foot the bill for fiscal profligacy in much wealthier countries.
Even the original advocates of IMF involvement are turning against the Fund.
EU officials are outraged by the IMF’s apparent effort to gain support in Europe’s debtor countries by urging write-offs of all debt that it did not issue.
And the US Congress has refused to endorse the expansion of IMF resources – part of an international agreement brokered at the 2010 G-20 summit.
While the outrage that followed the appointment of another European as IMF Managing Director in 2011 is likely to ensure that the Fund’s next head will not hail from Europe, the IMF’s fast-diminishing role means that it will not matter much.
As 2008’s secret history shows, what matters is who has access to the Fed.
Falling for Germany
PRINCETON – Germany’s general election in September and the prolonged formation of a new government since then have highlighted a peculiar development.
Not only does Germany now seem to be running Europe, but the rest of Europe seems to be falling in love with Germany – not least because, in a time of political confusion and economic instability, Germans are the only Europeans who seem to know what they want.
Germany’s exceptionalism is obvious.
Whereas electorates across the European Union have punished their governments for the Great Recession and the euro crisis, Germans reelected Chancellor Angela Merkel and displayed strong support for her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in the recent election.
Indeed, as with postwar Germany’s first leader, Konrad Adenauer, there are jokes about Merkel being Chancellor for life (Germany has no term limits).
Elsewhere, populist anti-European parties of the right have been gaining ground with campaigns directed against immigrants and minorities, especially Muslims.
This has fueled concern that the populist bloc will be the largest in the European Parliament after next year’s EU-wide election.
Germany, by contrast, has no anti-European party with any serious support.
Even the newly formed Alternative for Germany – which did unexpectedly well in the recent election, finishing just short of the 5% threshold needed to enter the Bundestag – insists that its anti-euro agenda is not anti-Europe.
They want to end the common currency, because, in their view, it is undermining the European ideal.
Against this background, Germany’s neighbors have been showing their love – or at least admiration.
At the end of 2011, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski called upon Germany to take a stronger leadership role in Europe.
This year, confronted with a revival of nationalist sentiment, former Polish President Lech Wałęsa – the leader of the anti-communist Solidarity movement – suggested that his country should enter into political union with Germany.
Likewise, as France slides into a governance crisis and its leaders’ credibility rapidly erodes, the leading French intellectual Alain Minc has published Vive l’Allemagne (“Long Live Germany”), in which he argues that Germany is Europe’s healthiest and most democratic country.
In Italy, the bourgeoisie of Milan and Rome have made a point of spending winter days dressed in characteristically German Loden overcoats.
When Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben recently appealed for a Latin empire to assert itself against Germany, his call was widely rejected, with several of his contemporaries asserting that, on the contrary, Germany should serve as a model for Italy as it seeks to overcome its current malaise.
Even in the habitually Euro-skeptical United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to boost his international credibility by highlighting his close ties with Merkel, rather than by emphasizing the UK’s “special relationship” with the United States.
Revealingly, the writer Miranda Seymour’s recently published book Noble Endeavours reminds Britain of the centuries-old love affair between Germany and England.
Maybe the royal family will go back to styling itself the House of Hanover?
While this admiration stems partly from Germany’s current economic success, the sentiment runs deeper – and extends beyond Europe.
China, for example, considers Germany to be much more than a model of export-led growth; for many Chinese, that success highlights the way Germany’s historical trajectory has been shaped by its struggle with the authoritarian spirit of the past.
Germany’s constitution – first adopted in West Germany in 1949 – lays out a striking vision, stating the country’s “resolve to preserve its national and political unity and to serve the peace of the World as an equal partner in a united Europe.”
With the division of Germany considered a microcosm of the broader European split during the Cold War, German reunification seemed possible only in the context of an integrated Europe – a point that Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized in the debates of 1990, as reunification beckoned.
The Germany that emerged from this process is uniquely suited to act as a model for Europe, owing to its federal character, which is reflected in strong constitutional guarantees of states’ rights.
Germany’s deeply embedded commitment to Europe and insistence on constitutionalism reflect its profound effort to understand what went wrong during the interwar period, the consequences of racism and extreme nationalism, and the legacy of Nazi crimes.
Few countries – if any – have so effectively internalized the lessons of their history.
When Merkel’s new government is in place, Germany will assume an even more important role in the pursuit of greater European integration – a process that will demand additional sacrifices, including the ceding of national sovereignty.
In a sense, this will be a continuation of Germany’s long history of self-abolition.
Roughly every hundred years since the Lutheran Reformation, the number of independent German political units has fallen by a factor of ten.
The 1648 Peace of Westphalia reduced the number of independent units in the Holy Roman Empire from 3,000-4,000 to 300-400.
In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, the number of German states fell to 39.
By 1866, only 34 members of the German confederation remained.
Another round of wars and peace treaties produced the kleindeutsch German Empire of 1871, and there were only three primarily German-speaking states left in Europe – the German Empire, Austria-Hungary (a dynastic unit, otherwise known as the Habsburg Empire), and the Swiss Confederation – none of which was a conventional nation-state.
While Germany’s 1949 split into the Federal Republic and the Democratic Republic raised the number to four (along with Austria and Switzerland), the overall trajectory has been clear.
If Germany’s new government leads the charge toward a stronger, more federal Europe, a century from now, there may well be no sovereign German political unit at all.
Germany and its lovers die in the end, only to live happily ever after.
History versus Europe
PRINCETON – History matters, but in different ways.
In some places and for some people, history means eternal clashes that are shaped by profound geopolitical forces: four centuries ago is the same as yesterday.
Elsewhere and for other people, history suggests a need to find ways to escape from ancient predicaments and outdated prejudices.
It is this cleavage that defines the intellectual battle now taking place in and around Europe.
With this year’s centennial of the outbreak of World War I, dozens of new analyses of “the war to end all wars” have rolled off the presses.
And it is tempting to see contemporary parallels in imperial Europe’s complacency, particularly its firm belief that the world was so interconnected and prosperous that any reversal was unthinkable.
Today, despite the supposed civilizing effects of global supply chains, tinderboxes like Syria or the South China Sea could blow up the world – just as the Bosnian conflict did in 1914.
Reflecting on the legacy of the Great War has also been an occasion for reviving the era’s mentalities.
In the United Kingdom, Education Secretary Michael Gove recently issued a polemic against historians who emphasized the futility of the war, calling it a “just war” directed against the “ruthless social Darwinism of the German elites.”
This looks like a thinly veiled allusion to the power struggles of contemporary Europe.
But 1914 is not the only possible or attractive point of comparison in interpreting Britain’s past.
Next year is the bicentennial of the Battle of Waterloo and the final defeat of Napoleon.
The right-wing British politician Enoch Powell used to claim that the European Common Market was the revenge that the Germans and the French imposed for the defeats that Britain inflicted on them.
The celebrations and commemorations will be full of symbolism related to contemporary disputes.
Already, British Prime Minister David Cameron has had to shift a summit meeting with French President François Hollande from the proposed site, Blenheim Palace, because French diplomats realized that it had been built to celebrate John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, who crushed Louis XIV’s forces in 1704, near the small Bavarian town that gave the palace its name.
The year 1704 is packed with meaning.
The victory over France laid the foundation for the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland.
That union is the subject of a vital referendum that will be held this year in Scotland.
Evocative historical dates are being used or abused in a similar way on the other edge of the European continent, to conjure up images of enemies that resonate in contemporary political debates.
A few years ago, a Russian film simply entitled 1612 evoked the Time of Troubles, when weak leadership caused Russia to be invaded and subverted by insidious Polish aristocrats and capitalists.
The film’s director, Vladimir Khotinenko, said that it was important that his audience “didn’t regard it as something that happened in ancient history but as a recent event… that they felt the link between what happened 400 years ago and today.”
As Russia struggles to bring Ukraine back into its orbit, another ancient date looms large: 1709, when Czar Peter the Great crushed the Swedish and Cossack armies at the Battle of Poltava.
That battle was also the subject of a recent Russian film, The Sovereign’s Servant.
Russian television commentators describe the countries most engaged in supporting a European-oriented Ukraine – Sweden, along with Poland and Lithuania, which had been brought into the Swedish orbit – as seeking revenge for Poltava.
Europe’s western and eastern fringes obsess about dates that recall their struggles with the core: 1914, 1815, 1709, 1707, 1704, and 1612, among others.
By contrast, the European core is obsessed with transcending history, with working out institutional mechanisms for overcoming the conflicts that scarred Europe in the first half of the twentieth century.
The European integration project is a sort of liberation from the pressures and constraints of the past.
After World War II, Charles de Gaulle evolved a complicated metaphysics to explain his country’s relationship with its problematic past.
Every European country had been betrayed.
“France suffered more than others because it was more betrayed than the others.
That is why it is France that must make the gesture of pardon....It is only I who can reconcile France and Germany, because only I can raise Germany from its decadence.”
Winston Churchill (a direct descendant of the Duke of Marlborough) had a similar postwar vision for overcoming past divisions and nationalistic quarrels. “[T]his noble continent…is the fountain of Christian faith and Christian ethics,” he claimed.
“If Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, to the prosperity and glory which its three or four hundred million people would enjoy.”
Is the European center currently too naive, or too idealistic?
Is it really possible to escape from history?
Or, on the contrary, is there something odd in the way that the European fringes obsessively resort to historical milestones?
In Britain and Russia, this obsession appears to be not just a way to assert national interests, but also a mechanism for appealing to a population disenchanted with the contemporary realities of decline from the imperial past.
De Gaulle and Churchill knew plenty about war, and they wanted to transcend the blood-soaked legacy of Poltava, Blenheim, and Waterloo.
They viewed history as offering concrete lessons about the necessity of escaping from the past.
Today, Europe’s fringes, by contrast, appear determined to escape into it.
Harvests of Hunger
New York – Lack of food is rarely the reason people go hungry.
Even now, there is enough food in the world, with a bumper harvest this year, but more people cannot afford to buy the food they need.
Addressing this growing crisis is the aim of the Global Conference on Food Security in Rome on June 3-5.
Even before the recent food price spikes, an estimated billion people were suffering from chronic hunger, while another two billion were experiencing malnutrition, bringing the total number of food-insecure people to around three billion, or almost half the world’s population.
Roughly 18,000 children died daily as a direct or indirect consequence of malnutrition.
Obviously, the recent increases in food prices are likely to drive the number of people vulnerable to food stress even higher.
There is now an urgent need to finance existing food aid programs to address mounting food demands, avert further social unrest, and ensure that farmers get the costlier farm inputs they need for the next planting season.
But, as we respond to the current humanitarian emergency due to higher food prices, we must not lose sight of the longer-term problems that have undermined food security in recent decades.
Clearly, a “new deal” for food security is urgently needed.
The major increases in food production associated with the Green Revolution in the 1960’s – with considerable government and international not-for-profit support – gave way to new policy priorities in the 1980’s.
As food supply growth slowed, demand continued to grow, and not only due to population increase.
With higher incomes, rising meat consumption requires more grain for animal feed.
Since the 1980’s, governments have been pressed to promote exports to earn foreign exchange and import food.
But food cannot be treated as just another commodity, and governments should develop appropriate policies, infrastructure, and institutions to ensure food security (not to be equated with total self-sufficiency) at the national or regional level.
The problem is that, having neglected food security and the productive sectors of their economies for several decades, many developing countries’ governments now lack the fiscal capacity to increase public spending in order to increase food production and agricultural productivity.
Moreover, growing urbanization and other non-agricultural uses of land have reduced acreage available for food production, while agricultural land is increasingly used to produce commodities other than food, such as bio-fuels.
But we should not rush to abandon bio-fuels, despite some undoubtedly poor policies in recent years.
Some bio-fuels are far more cost-effective and energy-efficient than others, and different bio-fuel stocks have very different opportunity costs for food agriculture (sugar has not experienced any significant price increase).
Another problem is that fewer and fewer transnational agro-businesses now dominate marketing, production, and inputs. This comes largely at the expense of small farmers and consumers, particularly the poor.
Moreover, with less government support, rural credit has often become prohibitively expensive.
In addition, more securitization, easier online trading, and other financial market developments in recent years have facilitated greater speculative investments, especially in commodity futures and options markets, including those affecting food.
Falling asset prices in other financial market segments, following the sub-prime mortgage meltdown in the United States, may be more important for explaining the recent surge in food prices than supply constraints or other factors underlying longer-term gradual upward price trends.
Meanwhile, rich countries’ agricultural subsidies and tariffs have undoubtedly undermined food production in developing countries.
However, cutting farm subsidies will increase food prices, at least initially, while reducing agricultural tariffs alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in food production in poor countries without complementary support.
Instead, some food security advocates have called for rich countries to compensate for the adverse consequences of their own agricultural subsidies and protectionism by providing additional foreign aid to the developing world, targeting production efforts that enhance food security.
To avoid catastrophe, the world community must also meet the urgent emergency food and planting requirements mentioned above, including more generous budget and balance-of-payments support for low-income food-importing countries.
Finally, as world leaders gather in Rome, the international community must secure a meaningful global commitment to food security that will not be undermined by contradictory policies.
Has America Lost its Mojo?
Cambridge – You know that American self-confidence is shaken when even the President starts expressing fear that the financial crisis may turn out worse than the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
George Bush is not alone in worrying that things might get a lot worse before they get better.
A growing number of savvy business people are also starting to wonder whether the United States will be able to right its economy anytime soon.
Professional forecasters are considerably more sanguine, with the consensus forecast for US growth in 2009 at around -1.5%, after a similar contraction in the second half of 2008.
This would be a painful recession, but far short of the 10-15% output drop normally associated with a full-blown depression.
Of course, economic forecasters have generally been far too optimistic at every turn of late, so the public is understandably leery of their prognostications.
Consensus forecasts do still seem optimistic.
With its financial system on life support, housing prices continuing to plummet, and unemployment rising, the US economy is looking more vulnerable than it has at any time since the 1970’s, and perhaps since World War II.
Still, it must be noted that negative output growth for more than two years is a relatively rare event, even in the aftermath of severe banking crises.
Historical statistical relationships are perhaps cold comfort in a downturn that now seems so insidiously different from previous catastrophes.
But they should not be dismissed.
Japan may have taken what seemed like forever to recover from its 1990’s crisis, but it is an exception – the crisis occurred as the Japanese economy needed to restructure in the face of the huge challenges posed by China’s emergence.
The complete policy paralysis that has prevailed during the interregnum between Presidents Bush and Obama has not helped.
US policy has devolved into a sort of “wheel of fortune” game for financial firms.
One day you get bankruptcy, another day loans with few strings attached.
One hopes that President-elect Obama’s all-star economic team will at least adopt a coherent and consistent policy.
Consistency alone would be a big boost for confidence. 
The basic elements of a recovery package include, first and foremost, a rational approach to rebooting the financial system.
This means mark-to-market pricing of assets, restructuring and recapitalizing banks, and a new approach to regulation that allows creativity while better protecting the public against some of the madness that has prevailed for more than a decade.  Help for housing is required to prevent overshooting in home prices, as is massive macroeconomic stimulus, including a moderately inflationary monetary policy.
A number of leaders, most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus.
These concerns are valid, even more so given government’s growing role in the economy.
But, as in wartime, one hopes these effects are temporary.
Besides, is inaction a real alternative?
Prior to the 1950’s, output drops of 15-20% in a single year were routine (admittedly, national income accounting was more primitive.)
A number of academic economists say we should simply tough it out as we did back then.
Recessions have important cleansing effects, helping to facilitate painful restructuring.
But today’s social, economic, and political systems – at least in developed countries – are unable to withstand a peacetime decline in output of 15-20% within a short period.
Massive stimulus and intervention – the US Federal Reserve’s current stance – is unavoidable.
One can only hope that the state can get out of the economy half as fast as it is getting in.
Nevertheless, the distinct possibility that stimulus and restructuring may work is further cause to hope that the deepening recession will not morph into a full-blown depression.
The US may be ground zero for the global financial crisis, but it is not the only country riven by self-doubt.
Britain, Ireland, and Spain each face financial crises of a similar magnitude.
Some countries that depend on energy exports, particularly governance-challenged ones such as Russia and Venezuela, are experiencing even worse downturns.
Even once-invulnerable China must contemplate a halving of its growth rate.
Europe and Japan do not have quite as complex financial messes as the US. But these regions are nevertheless mired in recession.
The global economy is in a pickle.
But, just as optimists were too sanguine in the boom, ultra-pessimists probably go too far in forecasting a depression around the corner.
2009 will be a tough year.
Yet, absent a large-scale conflagration, there is a fair chance that 2010 will see a restoration of weak growth in the US, Europe, and Japan, and probably robust growth in most emerging markets.
The US economy may have lost a fair chunk of its mojo, but it will require a lot more bad luck and policy blunders to get to a second worldwide Great Depression.
Has Cuba Lost its Last Chance?
BUENOS AIRES – Raúl Castro’s consolidation of his position as successor to his brother Fidel confirms that his Cuba will give the military domestic hegemony, which makes any serious political or economic opening in the near future seemingly impossible.
The Cuban Communist Party’s recent Sixth Congress reflected this, offering little new and rehashing a lot of the old.
Since ill health forced Fidel Castro to retire from Cuba’s leadership, Raúl has opened the doors to the military and pushed out even those civilians who had been his brother’s trusted associates.
While Fidel wrote doctrinaire articles in the official press, the armed forces took over politics and production.
Fidel’s appearance at the Party’s congress – an event full of political significance, because he has only rarely participated in public events since becoming sick in 2006 – seemed to confirm his support for this outcome.
We now know that the congress had been put off for 14 years, owing to deep divisions among Cuban leaders.
The civilian group that was ousted wanted to adapt the “Chinese model” of gradual economic reforms initiated by the Party. Raúl and his military cronies, however, cornered Fidel and imposed their group’s criteria.
In Asian communism – as practiced in China and Vietnam, in particular – the Party leadership rotates periodically, and a civilian leadership controls the military.
Systemic nepotism in the top political and military leadership exists only in North Korea.
By contrast, Cuba’s new Raúlist political structure takes its inspiration from the purest tradition of Latin American military caudillismo, using communist ideology pragmatically.
The model is clearly revealed in the nature of Raúl’s proposed reforms.
The economy’s most dynamic industries – namely, mining and tourism – are reserved for the military, which manages them in a business-like, profit-seeking way.
Only in these privileged sectors can some reforms be seen.
The “new class” that populates them does not demonize foreign capital.
Indeed, there are talks centered on debt, with some creditors interested in the mechanics of capitalization.
For the rest of the economy, the Party’s position recalls the famous line from Lampedusa’s Il Gattopardo (The Leopard): something must change so that everything else can remain the same.
The sale of buildings and vehicles will be legalized and self-employment authorized, mainly in the service sector.
But, lacking capital and forced to pay taxes, what fate awaits industries driven by the state into the market?
Nearly 1.5 million Cubans will never have a stake in the industries controlled by the military bourgeoisie. Nor was the issue of land ownership resolved: only a few plots will be leased in some form.
As a result, Cuba will continue to import a lot of food, most of it at a price that the population cannot afford.
Moreover, ordinary Cubans fear that their ration cards – their only means of getting food – will be canceled.
Indeed, according to Raúl, the state-controlled food-rationing system is a “factor of immobility,” but no one knows what might replace it.
The Sixth Congress ignored questions of human rights.
Neither freedom of the press nor access to information was on the agenda, and the opposition will continue to be ignored, its only options being conditional freedom or exile.
Migration, an option financed by remittances from relatives in the United States, was not made any more flexible, either.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, many believed that the Cuban regime would take the road to reform, however grudgingly.
But the democratic transitions in Eastern Europe made Fidel Castro wary, so the first opportunity for a similar transition in Cuba was lost.
Now an opportunity to introduce young blood and new ideas has similarly been missed: although the Sixth Congress adopted a ten-year limit for holding office, the two people designated to succeed Raúl Castro are both octogenarians.
In the 1980’s, Deng Xiaoping warned that China would collapse if it didn’t change; Raúl has said the same thing.
But Deng chose real reform and real change, appealing to overseas Chinese, whom the Party had demonized for many years, to bet on the country’s future and invest. The diaspora listened – the beginning and the secret of the reforms that put China on the path to its current economic success.
Cuba cannot remain isolated, dependent on Venezuelan petrodollars and penalized by America’s ill-conceived trade embargo.
Any realistic agenda for change in Cuba inexorably requires opening up to the world, along with ensuring full freedom within the country.
Unfortunately, the Sixth Congress demonstrated that the Cuban Communist Party remains in denial about the country’s prospects and options.
Has Financial Innovation Been Discredited?
MOSCOW – Skeptics of financial liberalization and innovation have been emboldened by the crisis in the world’s credit markets that erupted in mid-2007, when the problems with sub-prime mortgages first appeared in the United States.
Are these skeptics right?
Should we halt financial liberalization and innovation in order to prevent crises like the sub-prime disaster from recurring?
The entire sub-prime market is largely a decade-old innovation – the word “sub-prime” did not exist in any language before 1994 – built on such things as option adjustable-rate mortgages (option-ARM’s), new kinds of collateralized debt obligations, and structured investment vehicles.
Previously, private investors in the US simply did not lend to mortgage seekers whose credit history was below prime.
But, while it does sometimes appear that the current crisis is due, at least in part, to financial innovation, financial-market liberalization has been shown to be a good thing overall.
A study published in 2005 by economists Geert Bekaert, Campbell Harvey, and Christian Lundblad found that when countries liberalize their stock markets, allowing them to operate freely without government intervention, economic growth rises by an average of one percentage point annually.
The higher growth tends to be associated with an investment boom, which in turn seems to be propelled by the lower cost of capital for firms.
Of course, while complicated financial arrangements allow us to move forward economically, they also can create hazards.
Think of the scaffolding and equipment around construction sites.
Sometimes people trip over the equipment, or a piece of scaffolding falls, with disastrous consequences.
Any time you build something, there is always a chance of a setback.
But, with every setback, we learn.
Governments and insurance companies implement better safety requirements in response to construction accidents.
The same is true, over time, with financial disasters.
The US is one of the world’s most financially liberal countries.
Its financial markets’ high quality must be an important reason for America’s relatively strong economic growth.
Indeed, given a very low savings rate and high fiscal deficit over the past few decades, the US might otherwise have faced economic disaster.
The reason is simple.
Individual firms might have splendid investment opportunities – to enlarge plant and equipment, capitalize on new software, or exploit new research and new training of key personnel – but might be deterred by cash shortages or perceived macroeconomic risks.
Effective financial markets enable them to pursue such opportunities despite these constraints by enlisting investors to provide the capital.
These investors can, in turn, be encouraged when financial hedging devices and financial diversification protect them.
There has been a longstanding discussion about whether new derivative markets, which provide such financial hedging, tend to increase preexisting financial markets’ volatility.
The consensus is that they do not.
In 2000, Stewart Mayhew, Assistant Chief Economist at the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Economic Analysis, surveyed the extensive literature on this topic.
Mayhew concluded that it is rather difficult to tell whether derivative markets worsen financial-market volatility, because their creation tends to come when existing financial markets already are more volatile, or can be predicted to become so.
Moreover, he found that there is no evidence that derivative markets create volatility in underlying cash markets; in fact, they may even reduce it.
The effect on underlying financial markets’ volatility may not even be the right question to consider in deciding whether to permit new derivative products.
The right question is whether these products are conducive to economic success and growth.
Here, Mayhew concludes that new derivative markets clearly increase the liquidity and quality of information in existing financial markets.
And it is this liquidity and quality of information that ultimately propels economic growth.
The sub-prime crisis has exposed serious problems that we must address.
For example, we need stronger consumer protection for retail financial products, stricter disclosure requirements for new securities, and better-designed vehicles for hedging risks.
Some of the innovations associated with the sub-prime crisis – notably option-ARM’s, when extended to borrowers who couldn’t handle them – seem to have little redeeming value.
But others – those involved with the securitization of mortgages – were clearly important long-run innovations, because they can help spread risks better around the world.
So, we should not slow down financial innovation in general.
On the contrary, some of the fixes that result from the sub-prime crisis will probably take the form of still more innovation, further increasing the sophistication of our financial markets.
Has Global Stag-Deflation Arrived?
NEW YORK – The latest macroeconomic news from the United States, other advanced economies, and emerging markets confirms that the global economy will face a severe recession in 2009.
In the US, recession started in December 2007, and will last at least until December 2009 – the longest and deepest US recession since World War II, with the cumulative fall in GDP possibly exceeding 5%.
The recession in other advanced economies (the euro zone, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand) started in the second quarter of 2008, before the financial turmoil in September and October further aggravated the global credit crunch.
This contraction has become even more severe since then.
There is now also the beginning of a hard landing in emerging markets as the recession in advanced economies, falling commodity prices, and capital flight take their toll on growth.
Indeed, the world should expect a near recession in Russia and Brazil in 2009, owing to low commodity prices, and a sharp slowdown in China and India that will be the equivalent of a hard landing (growth well below potential) for these countries.
Other emerging markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe will not fare better, and some may experience full-fledged financial crises.
Indeed, more than a dozen emerging-market economies now face severe financial pressures: Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine in Europe; Indonesia, Korea, and Pakistan in Asia; and Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela in Latin America.
Most of these economies can avoid the worst if they implement the appropriate policy adjustments and if the international financial institutions (including the IMF) provide enough lending to cover their external financing needs.
With a global recession a near certainty, deflation – rather than inflation – will become the main concern for policymakers.
The fall in aggregate demand while potential aggregate supply has been rising because of overinvestment by China and other emerging markets will sharply reduce inflation.
Slack labor markets with rising unemployment rates will cap wage and labor costs.
Further falls in commodity prices – already down 30% from their summer peak – will add to these deflationary pressures.
Policymakers will have to worry about a strange beast called “stag-deflation” (a combination of economic stagnation/recession and deflation); about liquidity traps (when official interest rates become so close to zero that traditional monetary policy loses effectiveness); and about debt deflation (the rise in the real value of nominal debts, increasing the risk of bankruptcy for distressed households, firms, financial institutions, and governments).
With traditional monetary policy becoming less effective, non-traditional policy tools aimed at generating greater liquidity and credit (via quantitative easing and direct central bank purchases of private illiquid assets) will become necessary.
And, while traditional fiscal policy (government spending and tax cuts) will be pursued aggressively, non- traditional fiscal policy (expenditures to bail out financial institutions, lenders, and borrowers) will also become increasingly important.
In the process, the role of states and governments in economic activity will be vastly expanded.
Traditionally, central banks have been the lenders of last resort, but now they are becoming the lenders of first and only resort.
As banks curtail lending to each other, to other financial institutions, and to the corporate sector, central banks are becoming the only lenders around.
Likewise, with household consumption and business investment collapsing, governments will soon become the spenders of first and only resort, stimulating demand and rescuing banks, firms, and households.
The long-term consequences of the resulting surge in fiscal deficits are serious.
If the deficits are monetized by central banks, inflation will follow the short-term deflationary pressures; if they are financed by debt, the long-term solvency of some governments may be at stake unless medium-term fiscal discipline is restored.
Nevertheless, in the short run, very aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions – both traditional and non-traditional – must be undertaken to ensure that the inevitable stag-deflation of 2009 does not persist into 2010 and beyond.
So far, the US response appears to be more aggressive than that of the euro zone, as the European Central Bank falls behind the curve on interest rates and the EU’s fiscal stance remains weak.
Given the severity of this economic and financial crisis, financial markets will not mend for a while.
The downside risks to the prices of a wide variety of risky assets (equities, corporate bonds, commodities, housing, and emerging-market asset classes) will remain until there are true signs – towards the end of 2009 – that the global economy may recover in 2010.
Has Neo-Liberalism Failed Mexico?
Six years ago, I was ready to conclude that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a major success.
The key argument in favor of NAFTA had been that it was the most promising road the United States could take to raise the chances for Mexico to become democratic and prosperous, and that the US had both a strong selfish interest and a strong neighborly duty to try to help Mexico develop.
Since NAFTA, Mexican real GDP has grown at 3.6% per year, and exports have boomed, going from 10% of GDP in 1990 and 17% of GDP in 1999 to 28% of GDP today.
Next year, Mexico’s real exports will be five times what they were in 1990.
It is here – in the rapid development of export industries and the dramatic rise in export volumes – that NAFTA made the difference.
NAFTA guarantees Mexican producers tariff and quota-free access to the US market, the largest consumer market in the world.
Without this guarantee, fewer would have invested in the capacity to satisfy the US market.
Increasing trade between the US and Mexico moves both countries toward a greater degree of specialization and a finer division of labor in important industries like autos, where labor-intensive portions are increasingly accomplished in Mexico, and textiles, where high-tech spinning and weaving is increasingly done in the US, while Mexico carries out lower-tech cutting and sewing.
Such efficiency gains from increasing the extent of the market and promoting specialization should have produced rapid growth in Mexican productivity.
Likewise, greater efficiency should have been reinforced by a boom in capital formation, which should have accompanied the guarantee that no future wave of protectionism in the US would shut factories in Mexico.
The key word here is “should.”
Today’s 100 million Mexicans have real incomes – at purchasing power parity – of roughly $10,000 per year, a quarter of the current US level.
They are investing perhaps a fifth of GDP in gross fixed capital formation – a healthy amount – and have greatly expanded their integration into the world (i.e., the North American) economy since NAFTA.
But the 3.6% rate of growth of GDP, coupled with a 2.5% per year rate of population and increase, means that Mexicans’ mean income is barely 15% above that of the pre-NAFTA days, and that the gap between their mean income and that of the US has widened.
Because of rising inequality, the overwhelming majority of Mexicans live no better off than they did 15 years ago.
(Indeed, the only part of Mexican development that has been a great success has been the rise in incomes and living standards that comes from increased migration to the US, and increased remittances sent back to Mexico.)
Intellectually, this is a great puzzle: we believe in market forces, and in the benefits of trade, specialization, and the international division of labor.
We see the enormous increase in Mexican exports to the US over the past decade.
We see great strengths in the Mexican economy – a stable macroeconomic environment, fiscal prudence, low inflation, little country risk, a flexible labor force, a strengthened and solvent banking system, successfully reformed poverty-reduction programs, high earnings from oil, and so on.
Yet successful neo-liberal policies have not delivered the rapid increases in productivity and working-class wages that neo-liberals like me would have confidently predicted had we been told back in 1995 that Mexican exports would multiply five-fold in the next twelve years.
To be sure, economic deficiencies still abound in Mexico.
According to the OECD, these include a very low average number of years of schooling, with young workers having almost no more formal education than their older counterparts; little on-the-job training; heavy bureaucratic burdens on firms; corrupt judges and police; high crime rates; and a large, low-productivity informal sector that narrows the tax base and raises tax rates on the rest of the economy.
But these deficiencies should not be enough to neutralize Mexico’s powerful geographic advantages and the potent benefits of neo-liberal policies, should they?
Apparently they are.
The demographic burden of a rapidly growing labor force appears to be greatly increased when that labor force is not very literate, especially when inadequate infrastructure, crime, and official corruption also take their toll.
We neo-liberals point out that NAFTA did not cause poor infrastructure, high crime, and official corruption.
We thus implicitly suggest that Mexicans would be far wose off today without NAFTA and its effects weighing in on the positive side of the scale.
That neo-liberal story may be true.
But it is an excuse. It may not be true.
Having witnessed Mexico’s slow growth over the past 15 years, we can no longer repeat the old mantra that the neo-liberal road of NAFTA and associated reforms is clearly and obviously the right one.
Has Oil Production Peaked?
OXFORD – Throughout the history of the oil industry, fear and concern about the imminent exhaustion of oil reserves has been a recurring theme.
Such sentiments often spread and capture the public imagination at times of rapidly rising oil demand, sharp spikes in energy prices, and geo-political uncertainty.
So today’s talk of oil scarcity, which began at the turn of the last century, should come as no surprise.
Believers in oil scarcity point to the sustained annual average increase of oil prices from 2002 to 2008, declining output in many areas of the world, and the absence (until recently off the coast of Brazil) of large-scale oil discoveries in the last few decades. All these factors lend credence to the view that oil production has peaked.
In the face of relentless demand-side pressure, driven mainly by high-growth countries like China and India, some predict stratospheric energy prices, supply shortages, economic and social hardship, and even resource wars.
Given that oil is a non-renewable resource, in a sense the world is always running out of it.
Unless global demand collapses, at some point in the future oil production will peak and eventually be exhausted.
But this prediction is close to a tautology.
For it to be useful, believers in scarce oil must be able to predict such things as the timing of the oil peak, the state of demand when oil production reaches it, and the pattern of decline.
But the track record of “peak oil” theorists on such matters has not been impressive: their predictions have steadily moved forward the date that global oil production will peak.
Worse still, they have made no serious attempt to identify why their earlier predictions have had to be revised.
A major problem is that such predictions often confuse resources with reserves.
Resources are the available volumes of hydrocarbon without reference to constraints as to their accessibility and/or cost.
Resources impose an upper bound on what ultimately can be produced; thus, it is the relevant concept for determining the likely dates of peak production and ultimate exhaustion.
If the volume of oil resources were known with certainty, and if we could accurately predict the growth of oil consumption, calculating the imminence of exhaustion would be simple.
But these are big “ifs” – especially given the high level of uncertainty regarding the ultimate volume of oil resources.
While peak oil theorists have strong views about that, they do not allow for all the current and future technological possibilities that might increase resources.
Indeed, given the difficulty in estimating the total size of resources, many consider peak oil theories irrelevant.
Fortunately, the focus of the debate is on reserves and not resources.
Reserves are defined as the quantities of petroleum that are expected to be commercially recoverable from known fields.
The concept of reserves is technical and economic, not geological.
It is also a non-static concept, as estimates of reserves will generally be revised upwards or downwards as additional geologic or engineering data become available, as technology improves, and/or as economic conditions (such as oil prices and production costs) change.
In fact, the bulk of recent growth in world reserves is due not to new discoveries, but mainly to reserve growth and improved recovery rates.
Moreover, despite what many believe, crude oil is far from being a homogenous product.
There is a fossil carbon continuum ranging from easy, conventional oil, to deep and ultra-deep offshore oil, to extra-heavy crude oil.
With technological progress and rising oil prices, most of these reserves will become conventional, helping to push back peak oil for years.
The failure to distinguish clearly between resources and reserves – and to recognize the importance of prices, costs, and technology in transforming resources into reserves – results in bad predictions about an imminent peak in oil production and misinformation that has had a negative impact on policymaking.
Rather than focusing on the major short- and long-term challenges facing the oil industry, the debate about peak oil diverts attention to the wrong problems.
In the short term, there are concerns that oil production will peak soon, owing not to the unavailability of reserves, but to obstacles to investment – for example, access to reserves, sanctions, and policy uncertainty.
Some who believe in the imminence of peak oil consider these barriers essentially irrelevant, arguing that their removal would merely delay the peak for a few years.
But, in the long term, the challenge is how to make the transition to a new and sustainable energy path, and to evaluate the political, economic, social and climate costs associated with this transition.
Unfortunately, that debate has not yet started.
The current tone surrounding the peak oil debate is reminiscent of that surrounding the global war on terror, with the phrase “you’re either with us or against us” recycled to polarize observers and analysts.
But as in any other debate, once extreme positions dominate, the real problems are trivialized and marginalized.
Healing the Depressed Brain
Scientists and mental health professionals have made major strides in understanding and treating major depression, including the discovery of the role played by imbalances in brain chemicals such as serotonin and noradrenaline.
But there is increasing evidence that there is more to the story: depression also involves structural changes in areas of the brain that are involved in mood, memory, and decision-making.
Depression is often precipitated by stressful experiences.
The brain interprets our experiences and decides if they are threatening, and then controls our behavioral and physiological responses to them.
Data obtained from animal experiments show that harmful physiological changes result from the inability of the brain and body to respond to repeated stress with adaptive modifications in structure and function.
Three brain areas - the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala - are particularly susceptible to pathological changes in size and function.
These areas are instrumental in interpreting what is stressful and in determining appropriate responses.
Many chemical mediators are involved, including cortisol and adrenalin from the adrenal glands, other hormones and neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and noradrenalin), and responses from the autonomic and immune systems.
Depression thus leads to changes in the rest of the body, owing to long-term chemical imbalances in the systems that control the heart, the immune system, and metabolism.
The hippocampus, a key structure in the formation of memories of events and contexts, expresses receptors that enable it to respond to stress hormones in the blood.
We now know that it atrophies in a number of psychiatric disorders.
Within the hippocampus - a curved elongated ridge located in each of the brain's two temporal lobes - is a structure called the dentate gyrus, which produces new neurons throughout adult life.
Chronic stress inhibits neurogenesis and also causes many hippocampal neurons to shrink - a process called "remodeling."
Animal studies have shown that the stress hormone cortisol, together with neurotransmitters in the brain, also plays an important role in the remodeling of neurons.
Similarly, there is evidence that the prefrontal cortex - a key structure in emotional regulation as well as in decision-making and working memory - shrinks in major depression.
On the other hand, rather than atrophying, the amygdala, the seat of emotional memories, becomes hyperactive both in post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive illness, and there is evidence from animal studies of a hypertrophy of nerve cells after repeated stress.
A hyperactive amygdala, along with abnormal activity in other regions of the brain, leads to disrupted patterns of sleep and physical activity, as well as irregular patterns of secretion of hormones and other chemical mediators that control many of the body's structures.
For example, levels of the stress hormone cortisol increase in the evening, when they are normally low.
Over time, if uncorrected, major depression can cause such conditions as progressive mineral loss from bones, accumulation of abdominal fat, increased blood platelet reactivity, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Moreover, certain types of antidepressants may contribute to some of these conditions.
Nevertheless, one of the most interesting features of these structural changes is that they can be prevented, and potentially reversed, with medication.
Indeed, in key respects depression is comparable to Cushing's disease, a disorder cause by excessive production of cortisol.
The elevated cortisol in Cushing's patients is higher than that found in major depression, but the psychiatric and somatic features of Cushing's disease are strikingly similar: melancholia, depression, abdominal obesity, bone mineral loss, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease, along with shrinkage of the hippocampus and memory impairment.
The good news from Cushing's disease is that hippocampal shrinkage and memory impairment is at least partially reversible over several years after correction of the excess cortisol.
This encourages the belief that structural changes in the brain that are associated with major depression can be prevented or even reversed with the right medications and other treatments.
For example, neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus that is suppressed by acute and chronic stress is elevated by many antidepressant treatments.
Still, one of the problems with many of the current medications is that, even with treatment, the recurrence of major depression is very high - around 70-80%.
This suggests that physiological processes underlying depression - the ones that may also lead to structural changes in the brain - are not being completely arrested, and thus that a new generation of anti-depressant medications is urgently needed.
If so, new, the new antidepressants would have to target what appear to be progressive neurodegenerative changes in the brain, which we infer are taking place because recurrence of depression is so high under currently available treatments.
Lithium, a mood stabilizer and neuroprotective agent, has the properties we are seeking, although its toxicity makes it less than ideal.
As ever, the challenge facing medical researchers is to develop more effective treatments without reducing their safety.
Healing the Sick Man of South Asia
LAHORE – Pakistan is undergoing three transitions simultaneously.
How they unfold matters not only for Pakistan, but also for much of the Muslim world, particularly as the Arab Spring forces change upon governments across the wider Middle East.
Most Muslim countries were governed for decades by autocrats who had either emerged directly from the armed forces, or had strong “khaki” support.
That was the case in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and, of course, Pakistan.
The Arab Spring drained away whatever spurious legitimacy that style of governance ever had.
But, in Pakistan, delegitimation of military rule had actually occurred three years earlier, and the pressure for change came from much the same source – a restive and mobilized new middle class.
Several decades ago, the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued that economic prosperity in developing countries with weak governing institutions would not necessarily lead to political stability.
On the contrary, economic growth in such contexts can be – and often is – politically destabilizing.
That proved to be the case in Turkey and Pakistan in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, and later in much of the Arab world.
Indeed, the rising aspirations of Arab youth in Egypt and Tunisia, the wellspring of the Arab Spring, followed impressive economic growth that had failed to trickle down.
And such rising expectations have been visible in all large Muslim countries.
As Huntington suggested, when young people see their economies grow, they begin to demand participation in decisions that affect all aspects of their lives, not just their economic well-being.
Military-dominated political systems precluded such participation, so, with economic growth, demilitarization of politics became a rallying cry in all large military-led Muslim states, from Indonesia to the Mediterranean coast.
Even Iran, where the Revolutionary Guards control roughly one-third of the economy, was affected when the result of the presidential election in 2009 triggered large anti-government protests in Tehran and other major cities.
But demilitarization means more than transferring power and policymaking from the armed forces to elected parliaments.
In their recent book Why Nations Fail, the economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson suggest that elections – even those that are free and fair – do not necessarily move societies from what they call “extractive” to “inclusive” systems.
Indeed, extraction of a country’s wealth for use by the elite can occur even in democratic societies when those who dominate the political system face no constraints other than periodic elections.
This is where the effort to devise institutional mechanisms to check and balance elite behavior enters the picture.
Indeed, the search for such mechanisms is precisely what is now underway in Pakistan.
In Pakistan, a discredited military was forced by public opinion to withdraw from power, creating political space for elected representatives.
They assumed control (though not over the military), but did not govern wisely.
While their personal wealth increased, living standards for everyone else either stagnated or, for lower-income groups, declined.
So, as Pakistan negotiated its political transition, it experienced significant economic decline.
As a result, Pakistan’s judiciary, media, and many civil-society organizations are now engaged in attempts not only to keep the soldiers in their barracks, but also to constrain the political establishment’s rapacious behavior.
Three cases before the country’s increasingly assertive Supreme Court promise to take Pakistan from the phase of demilitarization to a system in which meaningful checks can be exercised on those who wield power.
One case is an attempt to force Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani’s administration to reopen proceedings in a Swiss court that were examining charges of money-laundering and misuse of public funds by President Asif Ali Zardari.
The Swiss proceedings were stopped at the request of the Pakistani government when Zardari became president.
In the second case, the Supreme Court wants Pakistan’s military intelligence agencies to account for hundreds, if not thousands, of missing people who were detained as part of the agencies’ campaign to contain the rise of Islamic extremism, or to undermine separatist aspirations in restive Baluchistan.
The third case opened an old complaint lodged by a politician decades ago against the “troika” – composed of the president, the prime minister, and the chief of army staff – that then governed Pakistan.
The plaintiff alleged that large amounts of funds were channeled to the troika’s favored candidates to contest the 1990 general election, in which Nawaz Sharif’s party won a big victory over Benazir Bhutto’s Peoples’ Party.
Finally, Pakistan is undergoing a transition in which power is moving from the central administration to sub-national governments.
The 18th amendment to the constitution, adopted in 2010, does precisely that, but implementation is being delayed by parties that prefer a highly centralized political structure.
If Pakistan’s transformation of its political system succeeds, it could serve as a model for other Muslim countries that are attempting to move from extractive to inclusive systems of governance.
Turkey has already traveled some distance along this path.
If Pakistan also advances, demilitarization of politics elsewhere in the Islamic world might not be far behind.
New Life in Old Age
ZURICH – Many of us have seen our aging parents or grandparents lose their independence.
In 2012, more than 2.4 million Americans over the age of 65 were treated in emergency rooms for injuries from falls alone.
With populations worldwide aging fast, the scale of such challenges is growing exponentially, affecting not only health-care systems, but also economies, government policies, and, of course, families.
The United Nations estimates that, by the middle of this century, the number of people older than 60 will double, with people over the age of 65 outnumbering – for the first time in history – children under the age of five.
The explanation for this demographic trend is straightforward: global fertility rates have plummeted, from five children per woman, on average, in 1950-1955, to 2.5 children per woman in 2010-2015.
Of course, aging citizens should not be viewed simply as an economic burden.
In fact, they can play a positive role as active consumers – a potential that many industries have already recognized and begun to tap.
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, people over 50 are responsible for almost 60% of consumer spending in the United States.
But that does not ameliorate the seemingly intractable underlying challenge: a shrinking pool of taxpayers to support a growing number of retirees.
This imbalance has already driven some governments to raise their retirement ages and change their pension policies to delay or reduce benefits and keep people in the workforce.
To keep people working longer, it is crucial to keep them healthy.
That is why the health-care industry must play a significant role in efforts to address the challenges of population aging.
Old age must be viewed not simply as an inevitable stage of life, but as an opportunity for health-care companies and systems to help people thrive.
To this end, health-care companies should shift the focus of their research-and-development efforts toward conditions that are prevalent among older patients, including chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.
Such efforts are also vital to find ways to stem more effectively the deterioration of people’s productivity and independence, by preserving their physical strength, mental acuity, and senses like hearing and vision.
This is important not only for older patients themselves, but also for their families and caregivers.
One particularly promising area is regenerative medicine, which has many potential applications – including for preventing or reversing hearing loss.
As it stands, one-third of people aged 65-70 (and half of those over 75) experience significant hearing loss, often caused by damage to or loss of inner-ear hair cells, which sense and transform sound waves into signals that register in the brain.
To address this issue, my company, Novartis, is testing a compound called CGF166, which targets certain healthy cells in the inner ear in order to “turn on” a specific gene that stimulates hair-cell development.
We have already entered the clinical-trial phase of our research, during which we will assess the tolerability and efficacy of CGF166 in treating patients with severe hearing loss.
But such treatments will mean little if they are not affordable or accessible to ordinary people.
And the current trajectory, with the burden of rising health-care costs increasingly being shifted onto patients themselves, is not encouraging.
To reverse this trend, the health-care industry must work with all stakeholders to support the financial sustainability of health-care systems, so that they can better handle the growing demand for care.
Success will require innovative strategies for improving patient outcomes in a financially sustainable way.
For example, the health-care industry could work with governments to offer health-enhancing services – such as remote patient monitoring, health apps, and patient-engagement tools – in addition to medications.
Ensuring the availability of trained health workers or counselors to answer patients’ questions about their treatment or related issues like insurance could also help.
For their part, payers – both governments and private insurers – should create a mechanism for rewarding health-care companies based on the real-world benefits of their products and services.
Beyond the annual payment per patient, the health-care company could receive a bonus or penalty, depending on the outcomes achieved.
Addressing the needs of aging populations is the biggest challenge facing health-care companies and payers.
A successful model will lower health-care costs, increase life expectancy, and improve elderly people’s quality of life.
And, by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the aging process, it could also guide us toward treatments and cures for other diseases – including those affecting the young.
Ensuring that every person lives as healthy a life as possible, for as long as possible, is in everyone’s interest.
That is why it makes sense now to focus on the most senior among us.
A New Era of Health-Care Innovation
ZURICH – We are experiencing a new wave of innovation in health care – one that promises to create the smartest, most connected, and most efficient health systems the world has ever seen.
Game-changing new technologies and treatments are transforming the practice of medicine, dramatically altering the patient experience, and creating conditions for even more breakthroughs.
The proof is in the data.
Last year, a record 61 drugs were introduced worldwide, compared with an annual average of 34 in the previous decade.
More than 40% of these treatments were for rare or difficult-to-treat conditions, including hepatitis C, meningococcal B, and metastatic melanoma.
And more new breakthroughs are on the horizon.
It is estimated that about 70% of the drugs currently in development across the industry are potential “first in class” treatments, meaning that they use a completely new mechanism of action against disease.
The new wave of innovation is attributable to three key factors: the ability to personalize therapy, the capacity to get treatments to market faster, and improved engagement with patients.
First, major advances in our knowledge of genomics – specifically, the way diseases manifest and develop in the body at the genetic level – are improving our ability to target illness at each stage and improve the patient experience.
Genetic markers, for example, can indicate which patients are likely to benefit from a drug, thereby improving outcomes while allowing patients to avoid potentially painful side effects of treatments that are unlikely to work.
For early-stage breast cancer patients, genetic markers show whether chemotherapy is likely to have an impact, or if hormone therapy alone is the better option.
A new lung cancer drug developed by my company, Novartis, is effective only in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have a particular genetic mutation.
The use of genomic expertise to improve health care is just beginning.
One promising area of investigation is CRISPR – a cutting-edge tool that could allow us to delete, repair, or replace the genes that cause disease.
As our understanding of the characteristics of a particular patient’s illness becomes increasingly precise, treatment will become increasingly effective and will reduce the risk of side effects.
Moreover, advances in our understanding of disease are boosting the efficiency of the drug development process, making it possible to bring new innovations to market faster.
For example, genetic testing is being used to pre-select participants for clinical trials, cutting recruitment times.
With this approach, research can begin in as little as three weeks, compared to the 34 weeks, on average, for a standard trial.
Add to that our ability to analyze data more quickly, and to make more precise decisions about dosing, and the clinical trial timeframe shrinks considerably.
Finally, real-time data and emerging technology tools have the potential to improve patient engagement and adherence, especially among those with chronic conditions caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
As the world’s population ages, the incidence of NCDs is expected to rise, accounting for 52 million deaths annually by 2030.
More than 80% of NCD deaths are the result of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes.
As it stands, noncompliance with medication regimes is a major problem in treating NCDs.
For example, diabetes patients in the United States with the lowest level of compliance have a 30% yearly risk of hospitalization, compared to a 13% risk for patients with a high level of adherence.
That implies large costs for health-care systems – about $200 billion in the US and €125 billion ($133 billion) in the European Union each year.
Technologies that engage patients in their own health care and enable more seamless adherence to medication regimes have the potential to improve disease management, reduce hospitalization, and lower costs.
Today’s transformational advances in health care owe much to new genomics information, to the availability of big data to influence decisions in real time, to more targeted and individualized therapies, and to smarter, more connected delivery systems.
But they are just the beginning.
Further breakthroughs, enabled by the convergence of science and technology, can be expected, especially as unconventional players enter the health-care sector.
In this process, partnerships between health-care and technology companies will become increasingly important.
It is an exciting time for health care, with many disruptive innovations on the horizon.
For patients and providers alike, this is very good news.
Health Care’s Frequent Flyers
NEW YORK – For those of you who have seen the (American) movie “Up in the Air,” think of the scene where George Clooney meets Vera Farmiga.
He’s an outsourced human-resources executive who flies around the country firing people on behalf of timid managers; she’s a counterpart female road warrior.
Their courtship ritual revolves around loyalty cards: he pulls out his American Airlines Executive Platinum card; she matches.
Next, his Diamond VIP Hilton HHonors card; she calmly slaps hers on the rickety table where they are sharing drinks.
The unspoken message: points make you sexy. Airlines and hotels have known this for a long time.
Dean Margolis, who long ago consulted for major airlines and is now applying the same techniques to healthy behavior, recalls wondering how to get executives to fly just a little more.  It’s not by offering discounts, which benefit an executive’s company rather than the executive.
Margolis asks: “When the boss says ‘Who wants to come to Philadelphia with me?’, what’s going to get two people instead of one to say yes?
To abandon their families, stand in line, and perhaps take a middle seat...”
Points, of course, will do the trick.
The promise of being recognized at the airline counter, ushered to the front of the line, and, yes, looking like a big shot at the airport bar.
Margolis’s new company, MedRewards, plans to give people points for healthy behavior – everything from taking their medications regularly to signing in at the gym more than five times a week.
As in the airline business, the actual customers won’t be the users, but rather the vendors who want to influence users’ behavior: pharmaceutical companies who want patients to buy their drugs, along with insurers and employers who want to lower long-term costs. (Employers, bless them, even have an interest in keeping people healthy!)
How do you translate healthy behavior into status?
First, of course, you can have cards identifying your compliance behavior – e.g., not how many drugs you take, but how regularly you take them.
As for the rewards, they could be everything from discounts on energy-saving appliances and posture-enhancing furniture to vouchers from suppliers of “healthy” foods.
With the right partner, such a scheme could also include better treatment from the medical establishment: perhaps a separate phone line to call your care provider, free WiFi while you sit in the waiting room (others have to pay), and even room upgrades if you’re unlucky enough to need surgery.
Just as with flying, which most people (George Clooney’s character excepted) don’t particularly like, users may eagerly sign up in order to collect points. 
MedRewards is not alone. A variety of other companies are taking different approaches, but all of them have the same goal – to motivate people to engage in healthy behavior.
And all of them avoid simply paying them, which is counterproductive over the long run, and may lead to cheating.
While some may think it worth cheating to get money, most people don’t want a gold card that they know in their heart is a fraud.
Yet many people will do all they can to game the system, a challenge that each company must confront.
Contagion Health, in which I am an investor, uses multi-person game mechanics to turn healthy behavior into status and rewards.
Its initial service, at http://imoveyou.com, allows you to challenge someone else by filling in a form, which is then published on the person’s Facebook wall or on Twitter.
For example, Alice could fill in the blanks: “I will walk three extra miles if @JuanTigar spends 30 minutes on the elliptical machine.”
Of course, people use imoveyou for other purposes – everything from challenging a roommate to make his bed to encouraging a colleague to beat a sales record.
So much the better. Getting people engaged in general is healthy, too – though the corporations and health providers that sponsor subscriptions will probably put some restrictions on subject matter.
Then there’s HealthRally, which uses insights from behavioral economics to motivate people to achieve their own health and wellness goals.
The basic insight is that owing something to your friends is a far more powerful incentive than getting something for yourself.
The user signs up and recruits friends and family to sponsor a reward of their choice for a specified goal.
(We can imagine a wish-list revenue opportunity here, where vendors can offer specific motivational products or services.)
From then on, the sponsors have an implicit right to check on the user’s progress, offering support or criticism far more compelling than any stranger could.
It’s relatively easy to fail on your own, but if your friends have put up real money, it’s much harder.
While the service is currently designed for individuals, companies could also use HealthRally to enhance their corporate wellness programs.
By providing matching financial rewards, for example, a company could leverage its employees’ natural support networks and provide a valuable boost to the pot.
All three of these companies let us use our own quirks and psychology to motivate ourselves.
Over time, MedRewards, Contagion Health, HealthRally, and others will have to prove their worth with data.
If people who use their services actually stay healthy, work harder, and cost less, the evidence will be hard to ignore.
And people who might not have adopted these tools on their own will be encouraged to do so by others with evidence and incentives on their side. 
Disclosure: I am an investor in Contagion Health, and am considering investments in MedRewards and HealthRally.
Health Food Truths
“Low-carbohydrate” pasta is in a category of health foods known in the trade as “lesser evils” – foods with fewer unwanted calories, fat, trans fat, sugars, salt, or carbohydrates.
There is now a whole industry of such products, as well as health foods classified as “natural,” “organic,” and “functional.”
But are these foods really better for you?
In the United States, “organic” has a precise meaning established by the US Department of Agriculture.
“Natural,” however, means whatever the food producer or manufacturer says it means.
So-called “functional” foods – or “techno-foods” – are those to which manufacturers add omega-3 oils, artificial sweeteners, indigestible starches, cholesterol reducers, soy or milk (whey) proteins, phytochemicals, and other ingredients to enable them to take advantage of “qualified” health claims permitted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Sales of lesser-evil and functional foods have done well in recent years, bringing in about $85 billion in US sales in 2004.
If you routinely buy such foods, you are among LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability) consumers – the health food industry’s cherished demographic base.
You buy low-carbohydrate products, energy and nutrition bars, vitamin- and mineral-fortified foods and beverages, soy foods, and practically anything with a health claim.
Like many people, I thought that small, innovative companies dominated functional foods.
In fact, PepsiCo holds a 25% share of the market with products like Quaker cereals and fortified Tropicana juices, which qualify for FDA-approved health claims.
Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft, Nestlé, and Groupe Danone all have market shares ranging from 4% to 7%.
These companies’ control of this market makes sense if you think about what they are selling.
The most popular functional foods are soft drinks, sports drinks, breakfast cereals, snacks, energy bars, and juice drinks.
About three-quarters of breakfast cereals make health claims for the whole grain or fiber that has been added to make them “functional.”
Moreover, as Nancy Childs, a business school professor, wrote in  Nutrition Business Journal in 2004, functional foods for obesity, for example, promise their manufacturers “a double reward”: eligibility for qualified health claims and possible reimbursement under Medicare as a disease treatment.
They also provide “balance to food company product portfolios, thereby limiting corporate liability on both legal and stock valuation fronts” – a reference to potential claims against companies that their products might cause obesity or poor health.
But many of these products are basically sugar water or sugary foods that might as well be cookies, with ingredients added or removed to appeal to LOHAS customers who would otherwise not buy them.
A private testing laboratory, ConsumerLab.com, found that hardly any of the “vitamin waters” it tested contained what their labels said they did, and some had only 20% to 50% of the amounts of nutrients listed.
Likewise, half the fat in most power and energy bars – which bring in $2 billion in annual sales – is saturated and some is trans.
Many bars targeted to low-carbohydrate dieters have misleading “net carb” calculations.
Some do not disclose their content of sugar alcohols, and some have so much of these additives that they are almost certain to produce laxative effects or gas.
Others are so highly fortified with vitamin A or D that ConsumerLab advises against giving them to young children.
Even if I had not seen these results and warnings, I wouldn’t eat power and energy bars, which, according to the magazine  Consumer Reports , taste “gritty, chalky, or chemical.”
I agree.
When I ask friends and colleagues why they buy the bars, they say: “Because I know they are healthy and I don’t care how they taste.”
Well, I do.
I can’t see the point of eating indigestible vitamin-and-fiber supplemented carbohydrates flavored with artificial sweeteners. If I think I need more vitamins, I prefer to take a multivitamin supplement.
If I need a hundred or so calories in a hurry, I prefer a banana, a handful of nuts, or, for that matter, a delicious candy bar.
This is not to diminish the value of some of the lesser evils – low-fat milk and yogurt, for example.
But most foods posing as “health food” raise the same question as vitamin-supplemented candy: does adding vitamins really make a food better for you?
Real health foods do not need to be made functional to be good for you. They are functional just the way they are.
The Developing World’s Health Innovators
DHAKA – We live in an age of tragic health paradoxes.
Mass immunization campaigns have eliminated entire diseases, but children in countries like Haiti and Bangladesh continue to die of easily treatable diseases caused by common pathogens.
Globalization has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty, but has left them exposed to the non-communicable diseases of the post-industrial age – from diabetes to heart disease – in countries that lack the resources to treat them.
Underlying these paradoxes is yet another: the vast majority of health research is conducted in wealthy economies, but the vast majority of the global public-health burden falls on low- and middle-income countries.
There is something grossly inefficient – even immoral – about this allocation of resources, which undermines the development of health solutions for those who need them most.
To be sure, it was possible to address the first generation of global development problems with straightforward transfers of capital and solutions from rich to poor countries.
Examples include programs to boost primary-school enrollment and, in public health, mass immunization campaigns.
But the new generation of development problems, from the quality of education to child deaths from treatable diseases, will not be so easy to resolve.
They demand long-term capacity building and knowledge transfers from rich to poor countries, with the latter gaining far more agency in developing solutions.
In other words, the focus of global public-health strategies and investments should shift toward reducing the structural disparities between rich and poor countries, in terms of their capacity for medical research and public-health implementation.
This mission – which, I would argue, should be the main goal of global public-health efforts today – would entail a central role for institutions like the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (icddr,b), based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I work as a scientist.
As it stands, most global public-health activities involve researchers from advanced countries leading local teams in developing countries.
While this is better than imposing ready-made solutions on the developing world, as occurred during the Cold War, it is not good enough.
Medical research and policy implementation in the developing world must be led by researchers and specialists from low- and middle-income countries – people who can combine cutting-edge scientific expertise with an intimate understanding of local contexts.
The value of developing-country-led innovation has been demonstrated time and again.
Over the last 15 years, scientific innovations spearheaded by developing countries contributed significantly to progress on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly those related to global health.
The contributions of icddr,b alone are enough to prove the value of developing-country health innovation.
The institute’s researchers carry out innovative and complex science, from classic clinical trials and epidemiological studies to behavioral-modification trials aimed at reducing the spread of infectious disease – with remarkable results.
An iconic example of icddr,b’s work is oral rehydration solution (ORS), a simple balanced solution of sugar and salt administered orally to people suffering from diarrheal diseases like cholera.
That solution, which icddr,b played a central role in developing, has prevented an estimated 40 million deaths globally since the 1960s, and has been called one of the most important medical inventions of the twentieth century.
More recently, my team and I developed a new low-cost system for delivering “bubble CPAP” (continuous positive airway pressure), which keeps air flowing during the process of treating severe pneumonia.
Trevor Duke, Director of the Centre for International Child Health at the Royal Children’s Hospital at the University of Melbourne, also participated in the project.
Our version of bubble CPAP, which uses cheap and readily available materials like plastic tubing and shampoo bottles, proved in trials to be more effective than the standard low-flow oxygen therapy recommended by the World Health Organization.
Following the trial, the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b implemented the new low-cost bubble CPAP, instead of the WHO-recommended therapy, as part of standard treatment of children with pneumonia.
Since then, the death rate for bubble CPAP-treated patients has fallen from 21% to just 6%.
These remarkable successes stem from the fact that icddr,b researchers – most of them Bangladeshis who trained abroad – are well acquainted with the problems they are trying to address.
They understand what it means to face severe – and, to some extent, insurmountable – resource constraints.
The 15-year MDG experience made clear the indisputable potential of developing-country innovation to advance public health.
Fortunately, world leaders seem to have taken that lesson to heart: the Sustainable Development Goals – the ambitious post-2015 development agenda adopted at the UN last September – are premised on the idea of local ownership.
But, despite vocal support for locally led research and development, severe constraints to developing-country innovation remain – and must urgently be removed.
Unsurprisingly, the tightest constraint is the lack of resources, both human and financial.
To ease it, developed and developing countries must now work together to ensure adequate investment to support local efforts reliably and sustainably.
With adequate support from local and international financing mechanisms, more innovation hubs like icddr,b could emerge and flourish in poor countries.
By advancing knowledge sharing and technology transfer, these hubs would enhance cooperation among developing countries, and help us finally overcome the persistent and tragic disparities that plague global health.
Health innovations developed in the world’s poor countries have passed the test of scalability and applicability in the places that need them most.
With the majority of the world’s population living in resource-challenged settings, we must recognize – and invest in – the efforts of those who are pushing the frontiers of medical science in the developing world.
Healthy People, Healthy Cities, Healthy Economies
OXFORD – The forces that drove the growth of European and North American cities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are now driving urbanization in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and other emerging-market countries.
Because the growth of these cities has been accelerated and magnified by productive technologies, rapid internal migration, and high net reproduction rates, many have reached unprecedented sizes at breathless speed.
Indeed, all but three of the world’s 20 largest cities are in emerging markets.
Many forecasts suggest that by 2030, the four largest emerging-market economies will have overtaken the G-7 in combined size, and that by 2050, today’s emerging-market economies will represent more than half the global economy and an even larger share of the world’s population.
These forecasts all assume that economic growth will be generated in cities.
But will emerging-market cities be healthy enough to drive rapid economic growth?
The issues that preoccupy health policymakers and practitioners in Lima, Cairo, Kolkata, and Jakarta reflect contrasting climates, geographies, histories, and cultures.
Each city is ultimately a special case. But they share some generic features.
But the urban poor, faced with bad housing, limited infrastructure, and meager services, are vulnerable to epidemics, malnutrition-based childhood diseases, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and mental disorders. They are also likely to be hardest hit by natural disasters, such as the floods and mudslides that devastated parts of Rio de Janeiro in January.
A second generic feature of emerging-market cities is that dense concentrations of poverty help create fragile environments that spawn civil disorders, resulting in death and injuries.
But a recent symposium at Oxford University concluded that emerging-market cities could improve and maintain urban health by capturing the inherent advantages of concentration, coordinating health policies and programs, adopting successful innovations, reforming health education and training, and developing improved planning processes.
Indeed, many potential solutions stem from opportunities for innovation created by the physical concentration of people and economic activity.
It is invariably more efficient to build and maintain health-related infrastructure, such as water supply and sanitation systems, clinics, and hospitals, and deliver specialized health care, where population densities are highest – and to create affordable-care networks of community health workers using low-cost technology. It is invariably easier to capture economies of scale and operation in public-health programs where those economies are greatest.
Moreover, while the health of urban populations is directly or indirectly affected by actions taken (or not taken) in almost every branch of government, few emerging markets have acted to improve horizontal coordination within national or city administrations. Fewer still have addressed the need for vertical coordination betweennational and city governments.
Tailored solutions are required – what works in one city might not work in others – but, because problems arising from weak or absent coordination are widespread, emerging markets should consider governance models that vest accountability for urban health outcomes – together with the authority to shape them – in city governments.
But such innovation does not always begin at home, which is why city governments need to know about potentially applicable ideas and lessons from other cities and countries.
Unfortunately, the diffusion and dissemination of innovative ideas in the fields of public health and health care is generally a random, haphazard, and inefficient process.
So emerging markets should collaborate to develop health-knowledge networks aimed at facilitating mutual learning.
There is also an urgent need to address the fact that public health and medical education in emerging markets is rarely integrated.
Having received different training and developed different mindsets, public-health officers and medical doctors (and their subordinates) often operate in silo-like environments – to the detriment of the people they serve.
Moreover, there are few opportunities for doctors to specialize in urban health.
To overcome this challenge, emerging-market governments should consider radical reforms in education and training in urban public health and health care.
Urban growth in emerging-market countries – and the corresponding concentration of poverty – has challenged and sometimes overwhelmed the capacity of their governments to provide sustainable and affordable housing, water supply and sanitation, solid-waste management services, and education – all of which directly affect urban health – as well as basic health-care services.
To address these issues emerging-market cities should practice anticipatory planning, based on realistic demographic forecasts; develop city and nationwide patient registers and health-information systems; and seek to integrate health and health-care planning with overall city planning.
If cities are to drive emerging-market countries towards a better future, their governments must ensure that urban housing, infrastructure, and services stay abreast of demand.
After all, an investment-friendly business environment requires adults who are fit to work and children who are fit to learn.
Ultimately, the economic health of emerging-market countries will depend on the reinvention of urban public health.
Heal Thyself Online
NEW YORK – An interesting phenomenon is happening to health care in the United States, quite apart from all the noise about changes to the country’s system of health insurance: individuals are starting to take charge of their own health and trying to avoid needing care in the first place.
Just as people long ago moved from institutional, mainframe computers to personal computers, they are starting to make the same move from institutional to individual tools with their health – not for treating serious diseases such as cancer, to be sure, but for everyday monitoring and prevention.
A variety of trends are coming together to make this happen.
First, it is becoming apparent that many health problems are self-induced: too much unhealthy food and drink, too much smoking, too little sleep or exercise.
There is nothing new about that insight, but now it is easier to keep track of personal behavior.
Just as we can use financial software to manage our money, we can now use a variety of software tools to monitor our own behavior and bodily statistics.
Many of these tools are things people first designed for themselves.
For example, J.J. Allaire founded the weight-loss Lose It! iPhone app for himself and has gone from 195 to 170 pounds (88 to 77 kilos) and gained some 4.5 million users in the process.
Like the founders of the Homebrew Computer Club, a seminal group of Berkeley computer geeks who got together in the 1980’s, many started by rigging up gadgets and later realized that they had come across a commercial opportunity.
Many of these new “homebrew health” people meet at so-called Quantified Self Meetups, where some people demonstrate their software and others come to learn or compare data with others.
The tools they use include everything from pedometers/accelerometers that monitor footsteps and motion (from Nike, FitBit and others) to sleep monitors (MyZeo), pulse and heart monitors, and glucose monitors (mostly for diabetics). People also count and calculate their food consumption.
Just as you can use your computer to manage your finances according to a budget, so can you use it to manage your body.
The hope is that the data may help you to modify your behavior in the right direction.
In my own case, I behave pretty well already: I swim for 50 minutes a day, I floss regularly, I eat sensibly, and so forth.
But now that I use the MyZeo sleep monitor (I sleep fine!), I have noticed a marginal change in my own behavior when I am out at night.
Sometimes, I am more motivated to leave early, anticipating extra sleep points in the morning!
It is a small thing, but the kind of change that adds up over time.
Potentially even more effective are social tools, using so-called “game dynamics.”
That is, just as you can earn points by collaborating with others in video games like World of Warcraft, so can you earn points by competing or collaborating with your friends in healthy behavior.
These are services that make health into a serious game where others can reinforce your willpower.
Imagine a health club that does not threaten you, but rather sends a message: “Juan and Alice will be waiting for you to join them lifting weights today at 4 p.m.”
Or “Your team is only four points behind the Blue team.
Please come and help us win.”
An existing service in which I plan to invest, www.GetUpandMove.me, allows you to challenge a friend: “I will swim for 50 minutes if Alice runs around the block four times.”
The challenge is posted on Facebook or Twitter, ideally soliciting encouragement from your friends.
Right now, this market is incoherent, much like the early days of the personal computer.
The different applications do not talk to one another; it is difficult to match your exercise against your sleeping patterns, or to share data with other people.
But that is the excitement: there are many companies at early stages, all looking for money and partners.
Not all of them will survive; with luck, some of them may merge.
Those with great technology and lousy marketing will find others with lousy technology and great marketing.
The companies with back-end standards will create interfaces to a couple of the leading applications; then other applications will tie themselves into those back-ends.
How will all this be paid for?
In the beginning, early adopters will pay for most of these tools and services directly; others will be sponsored by advertisers.
It would be good to believe that they will be effective, but so far we have little proof.
A vendor’s testimonial that nine out of 10, or 99 out of 100, customers are satisfied with the results will hardly be convincing, because those who fail to improve will have less interest in participating.
More convincing will be data shared by individuals and collected (with permission) by third parties.
At some point, employers, who are interested in healthy, motivated employees and lower health costs (but demand a lower level of proof than insurance companies and governments), are likely to come in, based on these informal data-collection efforts and their own pilot programs.
That will lead to more data being collected, and eventually there may be enough to convince insurance companies and governments to pay as well.
One part of me resists that: good health should be something that people do for themselves.
But the realist in me knows otherwise about what can help good behavior spread.
As a taxpayer, I would rather pay to foster other people’s good behavior than pay more for the consequences of their bad behavior.
China’s Climate Commitment
BEIJING – In what some might consider a surprising development, China – currently the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide – is emerging as a global leader in climate policy as it seeks to build a cleaner and more efficient economy.
Indeed, China’s efforts to curb pollution and environmental destruction, while shifting to a more sustainable growth model, can provide valuable lessons for governments worldwide.
The first step toward sustainable economic growth is to recognize, as China’s leaders have, that pollution – produced largely through coal-fired power plants – is profoundly damaging citizens’ lives and livelihoods, particularly in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
Moreover, greenhouse-gas emissions are contributing to climate change, the effects of which, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns, could prove devastating for all countries, with China highly vulnerable.
Moreover, China is already the world’s largest oil importer, and energy demand continues to increase rapidly.
As a result, energy security has become a serious issue.
In this context, the authorities’ effort to accelerate the shift of China’s growth model to one that is more innovative, inclusive, efficient, and sustainable represents the only feasible way forward.
The good news is that some progress has already been made, innovation is occurring rapidly, and clear plans are being formulated and implemented.
China is now the world’s largest investor in clean energy, with a record $68 billion channeled toward renewable-energy development in 2012 and another $54 billion last year.
Furthermore, its non-fossil energy supply more than doubled from 2005 to 2013 while the CO2 intensity of GDP fell by 28%.
And China’s reliance on coal-based energy is decreasing, with the rate of decline targeted to accelerate.
But much more needs to be done.
Over the last eight years, China’s economy has grown by an average of 10% annually – a total increase of around 115% – leading to a 53% increase in CO2 emissions.
Fortunately, China’s government recognizes the need to pursue more stable, higher-quality GDP growth.
At the same time, given slower growth in world markets and the challenges of domestic structural adjustment, the annual growth target has been reduced, to around 7.5%.
These structural adjustments are aimed at reducing China’s dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports while fostering domestic consumption, promoting higher-tech activities, and strengthening the services sector.
This shift will naturally bring about a decline in demand for energy-intensive raw materials like iron, steel, and cement; at the same time, it will better equip China for the next stages of its development.
To support these efforts, China will build generating stations that rely on natural gas, nuclear power, and renewable sources.
The government has already pledged $286 billion to renewable-energy development and $376 billion to energy-conservation projects in 2011-2015.
Investment in coal-fired electricity generation has been shrinking year on year since 2005.
As a result, by 2020, China’s consumption of energy generated from sources other than fossil fuels will be roughly equivalent to Japan’s total energy consumption.
Non-fossil energy sources will comprise 15% of China’s overall energy mix, reaching 20-25% by 2030.
Beyond that, such sources will meet all further growth in energy demand.
Along with more stringent restrictions on coal consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions, the upcoming 13th Five-Year Plan, for 2016-2020, will include additional investment in research and development.
With this mix of policies, Chinese carbon emissions could peak by 2030, even as the economy grows at a rate of 4-5%.
Coal consumption is likely to peak by 2025.
These targets may be ambitious, but they are entirely achievable.
In fact, with a sufficiently strong commitment from policymakers and businesses, China could reach its clean-energy goals ahead of schedule.
Indeed, moving to a path that offers a reasonable chance of preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 2oC above the level reached in the late nineteenth century – the established international goal – requires that other countries, too, accelerate progress.
This transformation promises not only to benefit the environment, but also to create new sources of economic growth and employment opportunities.
The Chinese dream of one billion citizens living in thriving cities – with access to high-quality education, job opportunities in high-tech industries, and a thriving services sector – can become reality.
And the benefits will not be limited to China.
Other countries can learn from China’s experience through observation and collaboration.
At the same time, they can benefit from the technological advances and cost reductions that Chinese investment in renewable-energy R&amp;D and deployment is enabling.
Finally, China’s deepening commitment to sustainability could improve the chances that the United Nations climate conference in Paris in 2015 will produce a global agreement.
The global nature of environmental challenges creates an important opportunity for international cooperation based on shared interest.
Such cooperation should extend beyond emissions-reduction targets to technology transfer, knowledge sharing, and economic opportunity.
Rich-country policymakers, in particular, should bear in mind this imperative, given their economies’ history of high emissions and greater access to technology.
While China’s economic transformation is vital to its long-term prosperity, it is one – albeit important – step toward mitigating the massive risks associated with climate change.
Lasting progress will require a similar commitment from governments worldwide.
The Spanish Revival
MUNICH – After fighting for its life for the last two years, Spain’s economy finally seems to have moved out of intensive care.
The banking sector has been deemed “cured”; demand for Spanish bonds has soared; and the country can once again raise capital at reasonable interest rates on the market.
But much more work must be done to ensure a stable long-term recovery.
First, the good news.
Investor confidence is on the mend, exemplified by the recent placement of €10 billion ($13.8 billion) in ten-year government bonds – which was over-subscribed by four times.
While risk premiums on ten-year bonds remain far above pre-crisis levels, yields have dropped considerably, from 4% at the beginning of 2010 to 3.2% today.
And a growing number of banks and companies are returning to the capital market.
Moreover, the Spanish economy returned to growth in the third quarter of last year, and is on track to grow by roughly 1% this year.
If, as expected, GDP grows by about 2% next year, Spain will outperform the eurozone average and create an environment conducive to significant long-term employment gains.
Perhaps the most notable consequence of Spain’s recent reform efforts is its current-account surplus – the country’s first in more than two decades.
At the peak of the crisis, Spain’s current-account deficit amounted to an unprecedented 10% of GDP.
Much of this progress reflects surging exports, which grew at an annual rate of 5.2% in 2013, outperforming Germany.
Rapid export growth, together with a drop in imports, enabled Spain to halve its trade deficit last year.
In fact, Spanish factories have boosted their productivity to such a degree that they are now taking orders away from their European competitors.
It should be noted, however, that productivity gains are partly attributable to a massive wave of employee layoffs – the dark side of economic remediation.
Likewise, the reduced labor costs and falling inflation caused by recession and austerity helped to boost Spanish firms’ competitiveness within the eurozone.
To be sure, wage and price adjustments, including temporary developments affecting food and energy costs, have turned Spain’s inflation rate negative, at roughly -0.1%.
But worries about potential deflation scenarios are unwarranted.
On the contrary, by increasing Spaniards’ real disposable incomes, low inflation is helping to stimulate private consumption, fueling a corresponding improvement in economic sentiment indicators, including consumer trust.
And yet, despite these positive indicators, Spain’s long-term economic recovery remains far from certain.
One critical test of its trajectory will be how investment activity develops over the next few quarters.
Though investment stabilized in the second half of last year, it remains well below pre-crisis levels.
The challenge is not simply to increase investment, but also to ensure that it is sustainable, unlike before the crisis, when excessive allocation of capital to real-estate development caused construction and related sectors to become overheated.
This time around, investment must be spread across all sectors, boosting their competitiveness and, in turn, their contribution to GDP growth.
Fortunately, the outlook appears promising, with increased private-sector confidence, rising capacity utilization, and an encouraging sales outlook for companies.
Ongoing fiscal consolidation – and thus strong pressure to keep a tight rein on the budget – will, however, restrict public-sector investment.
The most potent threat to Spain’s economic recovery stems from the labor market.
With an unemployment rate of 25.3% – and youth unemployment running at 53.9% – the situation appears grim.
Making matters worse, despite considerable gains in the last quarter of 2013, employment growth is far too weak to make a significant dent in joblessness.
In 2012, the government implemented sweeping labor-market reforms to increase companies’ internal flexibility (making it easier to dismiss permanent workers and facilitating wage moderation), and introduced a model for reducing workers’ hours.
But such changes take effect slowly, and often not until the recovery phase.
Given this, the government must do more to boost employment in the short term, especially among young people, whose knowledge, effort, and entrepreneurial spirit is critical to Spain’s long-term economic success.
Additional measures to improve vocational training or extend part-time work, for example, could prove to be invaluable.
The final challenge facing Spain is government debt, which currently amounts to nearly 100% of GDP.
So far, efforts to curb public debt have centered on painful austerity measures, including substantial cuts in the supply of public goods, especially health care and education.
At the same time, pension reform – including adjustments in how benefits are indexed to inflation – will ease some of the pressure on the public budget.
Such measures, together with further liberalization of protected domestic sectors, will strengthen Spain’s economic-growth model considerably.
The risk now is a relapse into reform fatigue.
While a slowdown in the pace of reform might bring temporary relief, it would almost certainly reverse Spain’s hard-won achievements.
Indeed, with the worst now over, complacency is the Spanish economy’s worst enemy.
Quantitative Easing for the People
OXFORD – It is now a near certainty that, by the end of this year, falling energy and commodity prices will push annual inflation in the eurozone below zero – well under the European Central Bank’s target of near 2%.
Rather than continue to allow misguided conventional thinking, centered on German economic ideology, to impede effective action, the ECB must pursue quantitative easing (QE) “for the people” – an adaptation of Milton Friedman’s “helicopter drops” strategy – to reverse deflation and get the eurozone back on track.
As it stands, conventional monetary policy has had – and American-style QE will have – little impact on the eurozone’s core countries.
This can be explained partly by the fact that, when it comes to credit provision, capital markets do far less of the heavy lifting in the eurozone (where banks matter more) than in the United States.
As a result, bringing down yields on government, corporate, and asset-backed bonds has less impact.
At the same time, the euro exchange rate – the one mechanism whereby current policies could still make a difference – cannot be pushed down much further.
For starters, given the eurozone’s huge trade surplus, doing so would incur strong international resistance.
Moreover, the mechanisms by which the US Federal Reserve’s purchases of asset-backed securities stimulate consumer spending – low mortgage rates, widely available home refinancing, high housing prices, and home-equity withdrawal – function differently in the eurozone.
In Germany, France, and Italy, higher house prices spur non-owners to save more for the down payment and inspire caution among tenants, who expect future rent hikes.
And the housing wealth of existing owners does not translate into significantly higher spending, given the lack of access to home-equity loans and cheap mortgage refinancing.
Finally, in countries like Germany, where households’ bank and saving deposits far outweigh their debt, lower interest rates reduce total household spending.
Another factor impeding QE’s impact in the eurozone is low bond yields, which, by increasing measured pension-fund deficits, make some companies reluctant to invest and thus more likely to raise contribution rates and limit pension benefits.
In the US, more generous assumptions regarding discount rates are used to calculate pension-fund liabilities.
Furthermore, US-style QE, in particular, tends to have adverse distributional implications, because it channels more money toward the wealthy, who have a lower propensity to spend, without providing much to the poorer people who would use it to consume more.
In the eurozone, the distribution issue is especially complex, given that institutional differences between countries can give the impression of discrimination among them.
Clearly, the ECB must develop a strategy that works in the eurozone’s unique system, instead of continuing to follow the Fed’s lead.
Such a strategy should be based on Friedman’s assertion that “helicopter drops” – printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public – can always stimulate the economy and combat deflation.
But, in order to maximize the impact of such an operation, the ECB would also have to find a way to ensure fair distribution.
One simple solution would be to distribute the funds to governments, which could then decide how best to spend them in their countries.
But the eurozone’s rule against using the ECB to finance government spending bars this approach.
A more feasible option, therefore, would be to provide all workers and pensioners with social-security numbers (or the local equivalent) with a payment from the ECB, which governments would merely assist in distributing.
Another alternative would be to use the electoral register, a public database that the ECB could use independently of governments.
Of the roughly 275 million adults with social-security numbers in the eurozone, some 90% are on the electoral register.
Extrapolating from America’s experience in 2001, when a $300 per person social-security rebate boosted spending by about 25% of the total amount distributed, a €500 ($640) check from the ECB could increase spending by about €34 billion, or 1.4% of GDP.
The extra tax revenue that such a rebate would produce would reduce government deficits significantly.
Beyond lifting the eurozone economy out of deflation, such an initiative would have massive political benefits, as it would reduce resentment toward European institutions, especially in struggling countries like Greece and Portugal, where an extra €500 would have a particularly strong impact on spending.
In this way, the ECB could prove to disgruntled citizens and investors that it is serious about meeting its inflation target, and even help to stem the rise of nationalist parties.
To be sure, some countries – especially Germany – are likely to resist this approach by marshaling arguments about prudence and responsibility.
But the fact is that “helicopter money” would work – and nothing in eurozone law prohibits it.
After years of austerity, infighting, and unemployment, it is time to implement a QE program that delivers what Europe needs.
Rescue Helicopters for Stranded Economies
BERKELEY – For countries where nominal interest rates are at or near zero, fiscal stimulus should be a no-brainer.
As long as the interest rate at which a government borrows is less than the sum of inflation, labor-force growth, and labor-productivity growth, the amortization cost of extra liabilities will be negative.
Meanwhile, the upside of extra spending could be significant.
The Keynesian fiscal multiplier for large industrial economies or for coordinated expansions is believed to be roughly two – meaning that an extra dollar of fiscal expansion would boost real GDP by about two dollars.
Some point to the risk that, once the economy recovers and interest rates rise, governments will fail to make the appropriate adjustments to fiscal policy.
But this argument is specious.
Governments that wish to pursue bad policies will do so no matter what decisions are made today.
And to the extent that this risk exists at all, it is offset by the very tangible economic benefits of stimulus: improved labor-force skills, higher business investment, faster business-model development, and new, useful infrastructure.
Aversion to fiscal expansion reflects raw ideology, not pragmatic considerations.
Few competent economists have failed to conclude that the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom have large enough fiscal multipliers, strong enough spillovers of infrastructure, investment, and other demand-boosting programs, and sufficient financial space to make substantially more expansionary policies optimal.
The question is not whether, but how much, fiscal stimulus is appropriate.
Answering that should be a simple, technocratic cost-benefit calculation.
And yet, in most countries that would benefit from fiscal stimulus, nothing is being done.
Faced with this, my former teacher and long-time colleague Barry Eichengreen has become positively alarmed: “The world economy is visibly sinking, and the policymakers who are supposed to be its stewards are tying themselves in knots.”
Germany’s experience with hyperinflation in the 1920s and its subsequent embrace of “ordoliberalism,” in which the government avoids interfering in the economy, has “rendered Germans allergic to macroeconomics,” Eichengreen writes.
Similarly, in the US, deep-rooted suspicion of federal government power – especially in the South, where it was used to abolish slavery and enforce civil rights – has resulted in hostility to countercyclical macroeconomic policy.
“Ideological and political prejudices deeply rooted in history will have to be overcome to end the current stagnation,” Eichengreen concludes. “If an extended period of depressed growth following a crisis isn’t the right moment to challenge them, then when is?”
Sadly, this debate is no longer an intellectual discussion – if it ever was.
As a result, a flanking move might be required.
It is time for central banks to assume responsibility and implement “helicopter money,” putting cash directly into the hands of people who will spend it.
Proponents of austerity in Germany, the US, and the UK are suspicious of central banks for the same ideological reasons they are averse to deficit-spending legislatures.
But their objections to central banks are far weaker.
That is because, as David Glasner, an economist at the Federal Trade Commission, has pointed out, attempts to erect an automatic monetary system – whether based on the gold standard, Milton Friedman’s k-percent rule, or the Stanford University economist John Taylor’s “rules-based monetary policy” – have all crashed and burned spectacularly.
History has refuted the University of Chicago economist Henry Simons’s call for “rules rather than authorities” in monetary policy.
The design task in monetary policy is not to construct rules but, instead, to establish authorities with sensible objectives, values, and technocratic competence.
The actions of central banks have always been “fiscal policy” in a very real sense, simply because their interventions alter the present value of future government principal and interest payments.
But when it comes to promoting economic recovery, central banks can certainly do more.
They have immense regulatory powers to require that the banks under their supervision hold capital, lend to classes of borrowers that have historically faced discrimination, and serve the communities in which they are embedded.
And they have clever lawyers.
Helicopter money could take many forms.
Its exact shape will depend on the legal structure of a given central bank, and on the extent to which its administrators are willing to take actions that go beyond their traditional authority (with the implicit or explicit promise that the rest of the government will turn a blind eye).
Success in rebooting the economy will depend on ensuring that the extra cash goes into the hands of those who are constrained in their spending by low incomes and a lack of collateral assets.
And, as with governments engaged in fiscal stimulus, the key to a positive outcome will be to rule out even a smidgeon of fear that repayment obligations will become onerous in any way.
Helicopter Money Is in the Air
LONDON – Fiscal policy is edging back into fashion, after years, if not decades, in purdah.
The reason is simple: the incomplete recovery from the global crash of 2008.
Europe is the worst off in this regard: its GDP has hardly grown in the last four years, and GDP per capita is still less than it was in 2007.
Moreover, growth forecasts are gloomy.
In July, the European Central Bank published a report suggesting that the negative output gap in the eurozone was 6%, four percentage points higher than previously thought.
“A possible implication of this finding,” the ECB concluded, “is that policies aimed at stimulating aggregate demand (including fiscal and monetary policies) should play an even more important role in the economic policy mix.”
Strong words from a central bank.
Fiscal policy has been effectively disabled since 2010, as the slump saddled governments with unprecedented postwar deficits and steeply rising debt-to-GDP ratios.
Austerity became the only game in town.
This left monetary policy the only available stimulus tool.
The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve injected huge amounts of cash into their economies through “quantitative easing” (QE) – massive purchases of long-term government and corporate securities.
In 2015, the ECB also started an asset-buying program, which ECB President Mario Draghi promised to continue “until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.”
QE has not been a magic bullet.
While it helped stop the slide into another Great Depression, successive injections of money have yielded diminishing returns.
The ECB’s announcement of its policy narrowed the gap in bond yields between Europe’s core and periphery.
But a study by Thomas Fazi of the Institute for New Economic Thinking emphasizes QE’s lack of influence on bank lending, the increase in non-performing loans, and the dire output and inflation figures themselves.
Moreover, QE has undesirable distributional consequences, because it gives money to those who have already have it, and whose current spending is little influenced by having more.
Policymakers should have been alert to the likelihood of this mediocre outcome.
When central banks try to reduce inflation by pumping liquidity out of the system, their policy is subverted by commercial banks’ ability to pump it back in by making loans.
In today’s deflationary environment, the reverse has happened.
Central banks’ attempt to pump in liquidity to stimulate activity is subverted by commercial banks’ ability to pump liquidity out by augmenting reserves and refusing to lend.
That leaves fiscal policy.
The logic of current economic conditions implies that governments should be taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure projects, which would both stimulate demand and improve the structure of the economy.
The problem is the climate of expectations.
As the Oxford economist John Muellbauer says, treasuries and central banks have been “hammering into the consciousness of the private sector the importance of reducing gross government debt relative to GDP.”
This orthodoxy arises from the idea that borrowing is simply “deferred taxation.”
If the private sector believes that taxes will have to rise to pay for government borrowing, according to this view, people will increase their savings to pay the higher taxes, thus destroying any stimulative effect.
The orthodoxy mistakenly assumes that government spending cannot generate any extra income; but so long as it prevails, debt-financed fiscal policy is ruled out as a means to revive economic growth.
As a result, analysts and policymakers have started mooting ideas for unconventional fiscal policy to supplement unconventional monetary policy.
In particular, they are debating variations of so-called helicopter money, following a famous thought experiment by Milton Friedman in 1969, in which “one day a helicopter…drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky.”
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, among others, has offered influential support for “helicopter drops” to revive flagging economies.
Helicopter money comes in two forms, which could (and should) be dropped together.
The first is to put purchasing power directly into the hands of consumers – for example, by issuing each voter or citizen with smart cards worth $1,000 each.
The Swiss economist Silvio Gesell, who originally proposed a scheme of “stamped money” at the start of the last century, added a stipulation that balances unspent after a month should be taxed, to discourage hoarding.
Alternatively, helicopter money could be used to finance infrastructure spending.
The advantage of such “monetary financing” is that such spending, while adding to the deficit and leading to a permanent increase in the money supply, would not increase the national debt, because the government would “owe” the money only to its own banker.
This would eliminate the offsetting negative expectation of higher taxes.
Surely, issuing debt that never has to be repaid is too good to be true, right?
There is indeed the obvious danger that governments might easily become addicted to monetary finance to pay for private and public spending, which is why it is unlikely to be tried openly unless economic conditions worsen significantly.
But the political risk of doing nothing if we stumble into another recession (as seems quite likely) is worse.
Like it or not, unconventional fiscal policy could well be the next game in town.
Money from Heaven?
TOKYO – The world economy is struggling.
The single currency is fettering, not freeing, the eurozone; Japan is smarting from the slowdown of America’s normalization of monetary policy; and emerging markets worldwide are suffering the consequences of China’s economic mismanagement.
But adverse global conditions, however troubling, should not lead central bankers to neglect the risks of untested policies – above all the “helicopter drops” that many are now proposing.
Conceived in 1969 by Milton Friedman as part of a thought experiment – not an actual proposal – helicopter drops got their name from the fantastic vision of fresh money being scattered from a helicopter whirring overheard.
But the point of helicopter drops – or what former US Fed Chair Ben Bernanke recently called a “money-financed fiscal program” (MFFP) – is simply to distribute newly printed cash directly to consumers, such as through tax rebates.
Over the last half-century, central bankers have repeatedly ruled out the use of MFFP.
But in the current environment of persistently weak aggregate demand, below-target inflation, and slow or no output growth, economists worldwide have been desperately seeking deus ex machina – a search that, for some, has led to the heliport.
Among the most prominent advocates of MFFP is Adair Turner, whose latest book, Between Debt and the Devil, provides an insightful thought experiment on the use of helicopter money.
Turner and his fellow MFFP advocates seem to believe that placing more money in the hands of the public is practically always welcome.
In their view, it is not only a straightforward way instantly to boost real demand; it also seems preferable to debt-financed fiscal stimulus, owing both to political constraints on debt-burdened governments and to MFFP’s more direct – and thus faster – impact on economy-wide spending.
But MFFP could easily produce too much demand.
The only guarantee against an inflationary surge in this scenario is the prudence of policymakers.
But their incentive to limit inflation may not be particularly strong.
In fact, throughout history, governments have had strong political incentives to monetize the deficit, with the subsequent inflation reducing the debt burden (and effectively confiscating the borrowed savings).
That is why inflation is so much more prevalent in history than deflation.
Yet no MFFP proposal even recognizes this tendency, much less includes provisions to avoid it.
Of course, central banks are independent from government precisely to ensure that their policies are utterly pragmatic, instead of being shaped by partisan politics.
But, in reality, such conduct has been repeatedly absent.
Who today still holds up former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan as a paragon of sagacity?
Still, the biggest risk is posed by fiscal authorities, who tend to be more heavily influenced by political considerations.
Unfortunately, MFFP, by matching monetary expansion to fiscal expansion, effectively empowers fiscal authorities over monetary authorities.
Turner believes that Japan, in particular, would benefit from helicopter drops.
In his view, MFFP is the ideal solution to spur demand, without further augmenting Japan’s already-heavy debt burden.
But Japan’s large public-debt burden is dangerous precisely because of its potential to spur inflation, through the monetization of the debt.
In this context, introducing MFFP – a policy that is even more likely to destabilize prices – seems dangerous.
Japan has made this mistake before.
In 1931, after more than a decade of deep deflation, Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi used debt-financed fiscal expansion to bring about a domestic economic revival.
But Takahashi knew when it was time to rein in spending, and in 1934 he attempted to do just that.
His focus on reducing military expenditure, however, attracted strong opposition from army officers, who assassinated Takahashi in 1936.
His successor allowed the military budget to swell, funded by newly created money.
This stimulated rapid inflation, which was brought under control only after the reconstruction following World War II.
Today, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s approach to monetary expansion – central to his “Abenomics” program for economic recovery – is producing positive results, especially in the labor market.
The job-to-applicant ratio stands at 1.28, its highest level since 1991.
The wages of part-time workers are, for the first time in Japan’s history, rising faster than those of full-time employees.
Moreover, prices of food products have started to increase.
Japanese companies are generating strong profits (Japanese stocks may even be undervalued).
And, although GDP is growing very slowly, and even turning negative from time to time, gross national income continues to rise steadily.
It seems clear that, rather than risk triggering inflation, Japan should continue on this promising path.
And, indeed, even Turner has offered an alternative proposal that fits with this scenario.
He recommends that Japan continue its current method of monetary easing – which can boost demand, while maintaining some safeguard against inflation – and postpone its forthcoming consumption-tax hike.
While fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion do not always have to go hand in hand, under current circumstances in Japan, this proposal makes sense.
The False Promise of Helicopter Money
LONDON – One of the most prominent questions concerning the global economy today is whether monetary policy is approaching the limit of its effectiveness.
Inflation remains well below target in the eurozone and Japan, despite aggressive quantitative easing (QE) and negative policy interest rates, and both the euro and yen have appreciated against the US dollar since the start of the year.
The problem with the debate is that it has focused solely on the effectiveness of policies, without considering the need for prudence.
The credibility and independence of monetary authorities are essential to the effectiveness of their policies.
And yet some of the proposals being fielded call for central banks to stray further into uncharted territory, expanding and extending their deviation from careful balance-sheet management.
This could inflict reputational damage that may be difficult to rectify, with real financial and economic consequences.
The direct impact of unconventional monetary policy is apparent and largely as expected (with the exception of the recent appreciation of the euro and yen).
Liquidity in banking systems is ample, and borrowing costs have declined, even turning negative for some governments.
But the expected second-order effects – increased economic activity and inflation – have not materialized.
As a result, despite the fact that headline inflation is being dragged down by low commodity prices, a near-consensus has emerged that additional easing is required.
Monetary policy is not the only option for further easing, but it is the most likely.
Structural reforms to support growth typically have long gestation periods, and the economic dislocations that accompany them reduce their political appeal.
Further fiscal easing is at least partly constrained by record-high levels of government debt, which will take many years to bring down.
When it comes to monetary policy, however, the options are similarly limited.
Even monetary policymakers acknowledge that QE is subject to diminishing returns, while adverse effects on the banking system limit the scope for setting policy rates too deeply negative.
As a result, an old idea, first proposed by Milton Friedman in 1969, is making a comeback: “helicopter money.”
Advocates envisage central banks creating money and distributing it directly to those who would spend it, resulting in immediate increases in demand and inflation.
Because households might choose to save some of the money, contemporary suggestions center on helicopter money being transferred to governments, to invest in infrastructure projects or other demand-enhancing initiatives.
Variations call for central banks to buy perpetual government bonds that pay no interest or to convert existing bond holdings into something similar.
Such proposals are troubling for many reasons.
The direct funding by central banks of fiscal deficits or purchases of government debt would result in the monetization of fiscal policy.
Monetization unambiguously weakens central banks’ balance sheets by adding assets that carry no real value (claims on government that will never be repaid), offset by liabilities (newly created money) generated to acquire them.
Advocates of helicopter money rely on two claims.
Some believe that policy can be calibrated to stop short of inflicting meaningful harm, usually because the resulting improvement in economic conditions will obviate the need for continued stimulus.
For others, central banks’ balance sheets are not a constraint, because the exclusive ability to create additional unlimited and cost-free liabilities guarantees long-term profitability.
There are problems with both claims.
Relying on a calibrated approach counts on stimulus being withdrawn before any evidence of concern over the central bank’s finances appears.
But there is no certainty that monetized fiscal spending will spark an economic recovery.
Nor can it be known beforehand that expansionary fiscal policy would be curtailed if economic prospects do not improve.
In fact, in the absence of negative public or market commentary on central-bank finances, the fiscal authorities may be tempted to expand their use of cost-free funding in what looks from their perspective very much like the proverbial “free lunch.”
There are also serious reasons to doubt the claim that seigniorage – the profit to central banks from having zero-cost liabilities (and at least some income-generating assets) – would guarantee profitability in the long term.
Never in the post-gold standard era has there been greater focus on the limits of monetary policy.
This focus could easily turn to the health of central banks’ balance sheets if they continue to expand.
The concept of seigniorage is poorly understood outside a relatively small community; it should not be used as the first line of defense.
None of this comes as news to central banks, which attach the utmost importance to their reputation for having robust finances, carefully managing risk, and ensuring the soundness of money.
Indeed, the financial prudence that underpins policy credibility and confidence in central banks is ultimately what makes seigniorage possible.
Only institutions that are perceived as financially viable can expect their liabilities to be held by others as assets; central banks are no exception.
At stake is the value of money.
Helicopter money would transfer risk from governments’ balance sheets to those of central banks, blurring the lines between policies, institutions, and their relative autonomy.
Its appeal lies in being able to exploit the unique financial structures of central banks.
But there are limits beyond which confidence in the financial integrity of central banks – and consequently the soundness of money – will be undermined.
Those limits are of course impossible to identify in advance.
But at a time of heightened sensitivity to the implementation and effectiveness of monetary policy, it would be a mistake to embark on a path that jeopardizes central banks’ very viability.
Help the Poor Help Themselves
HELSINKI – One early result of today’s global recession is that many donor governments are trimming their foreign aid programs.
Before taking office, President Barack Obama had promised a doubling of American foreign assistance, from $25 billion to $50 billion, but since then Vice-President Joe Biden has warned that this commitment will probably be achieved more slowly because of the downturn.
Here in Finland, our aid decreased by 62% in the early 1990’s, a period that Finns still call “The Depression.”
Japan’s overseas aid declined by 44% when that country hit hard times.
The current worldwide slump could bring a cut in official development assistance (ODA) of 30%.
It is also easy to predict that donor governments will be looking carefully at the ever-growing expenditure on the United Nations’ 14 peacekeeping operations around the world.
The total bill for all UN operations in the 12 months to mid-2008 reached $6.7 billion, about twice the level 15 years ago.
One can only imagine the grave consequences if operations that are already spread thin are cut.
Recall that the Rwandan genocide was preceded by a similar lack of enthusiasm for financing the UN mission there.
Recent events in Congo and elsewhere suggest that there is no room for complacency.
But by far the biggest transfer of assets from rich countries to the developing world takes place through migrant workers’ remittances.
Few decision-makers seem aware of this.
In 2006, around 150 million migrants sent roughly $300 billion to their families in developing countries.
The number of transactions is huge, estimated at 1.5 billion remittances annually.
Most are for sums of only $100-$300, and they normally go towards immediate household consumption.
The value of all ODA in 2006 was $126 billion, less than half the value of private remittances, even though it includes assistance from OECD and non-OECD countries, as well as from China.
If the recession costs migrants their jobs in richer host countries and forces them to return home to their countries of origin, millions of already poor people will be thrown into greater poverty.
The possible impact can be gauged by looking at where the $300 billion in remittances are distributed.
In 2006, poorer European countries received about $50 billion, Africa got $38 billion, Latin America and the Caribbean $68 billion, the Middle East $24 billion.
Asia is the major beneficiary, receiving $113 billion.
In all, an estimated 10% of the world’s population is estimated to benefit from remittances, with 57 countries each receiving $1 billion or more annually.
Indeed, some countries are dependent on this income flow.
Cape Verde received 34% of its GDP from remittances, Eritrea 38% and Burundi 23%.
In Asia, the figures were 30% for Afghanistan and 38% for Tajikistan, while in Europe Moldova received 31% of its GDP from external sources.
Some of these countries are either in conflict or are fragile states, so a diminishing flow of remittances will aggravate their instability, and perhaps increase the flow of migration to other countries.
Governments in Europe and elsewhere should therefore consider carefully what other forces will be at work if and when migrant workers are sent home.
These governments already spend tax money on direct foreign aid.
So they should weigh tax breaks that might entice employers to keep migrant workers on the payrolls, as this would probably be a much more efficient way to support these poor countries.
Moreover, given that transaction costs often take a big slice of remittances, aid mechanisms could be used to create safe and cheap channels for financial flows, especially where private money cannot easily reach remote rural areas, as is often the case in Africa or Asia.
Anti-terrorism laws are a problem here, because the demand for more effective control mechanisms on international financial transfers places an extra burden on remittance operators.
These new rules have certainly pushed transaction costs higher.
But the fight against terror and its financing means that governments and financial institutions have extensive data on the cross-border flow of money, which should be used to help people send money to their relatives more easily.
Sending money to some countries is now allowed only through formal banking channels, and this has created virtual monopolies while also preventing remittance money from reaching rural areas where banks don’t operate.
In West Africa, a simple money transfer operator now handles 70% of official payments and also imposes exclusivity on banks.
Allowing more informal financial institutions to channel foreign payments would ease the money flow to remote regions.
Cooperatives, credit unions, and new forms of micro-financing could form networks that would ensure greater accessibility.
Restrictive legal rules in some countries exclude migrants from using official banking systems unless they have the necessary legal status.
Other countries, however, have taken steps to make remittance transfers possible via mobile phones.
The sheer size of these remittances, and their importance in keeping many millions of people above the poverty line, suggests that rich-country governments should take a careful look at the existing system.
An improved system could help alleviate the burden imposed on innocent victims of the financial and economic downturn.
Such a review of remittances should look into restrictive practices that could be abolished, and ask whether official assistance should be adapted to the needs of this informal yet crucially important aid network.
The Living Legacy of Helsinki
VIENNA – Forty years ago, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe concluded with the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, a historic triumph of cooperation over conflict that set the stage for the end of the Cold War.
The accord represented a revolutionary approach to comprehensive security, as well as to bilateral and multilateral relations.
Its signatories recognized a direct link between political and military issues and human rights concerns – and that this link is a fundamental component of peace and security.
That is why, when Serbia was entrusted to lead the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which grew from the Helsinki conference, this year, we were looking forward to celebrating the accord’s many achievements on its 40th anniversary.
But, with the resurgence of armed conflict in Europe challenging the Helsinki Final Act’s fundamental principles, this anniversary has taken on new meaning.
The crisis in Ukraine has, in fact, underscored the Final Act’s enduring relevance.
Indeed, the only way to reconsolidate European security is to reach a durable settlement based on its principles; indeed, had those principles been respected, the current crisis in Ukraine would not have occurred in the first place.
It is now apparent that the roots of that crisis are far deeper than anyone initially realized.
Well before the turmoil in Ukraine erupted, the East-West divide, which our predecessors worked hard to close in Helsinki, had begun to reemerge.
A growing sense of mistrust and hostility, together with a diminishing commitment to the OSCE’s brand of comprehensive security, was hindering cooperation in various areas.
Constructive engagement on security issues had been difficult for some time, reflected in a lack of progress on arms control and other key areas of the OSCE agenda.
The emergence of the crisis in and around Ukraine has only made these challenges more profound, and the search for a solution more urgent.
The high-level Panel of Eminent Persons on European Security as a Common Project, established at the Basel Ministerial Council by last year’s Swiss OSCE chairmanship, provided invaluable insights when they presented their Interim Report on European security at the Munich Security Conference Core Group Meeting in Vienna this week.
The report focuses on the lessons of the OSCE’s engagement in Ukraine, and part of the solution is reflected in the Panel’s title; European security is, indeed, a common project.
The OSCE could play a pivotal role, serving, like the Helsinki conference 40 years ago, as a platform to overcome the existing divide, restore trust, and rebuild a cooperative approach to common security concerns.
The most visible aspects of the OSCE response to the crisis in and around Ukraine have been carried out by the Trilateral Contact Group and the Special Monitoring Mission.
Yet the entire OSCE toolbox has been mobilized to mitigate the crisis, as well as to support other critical steps, including constitutional reform, the protection of ethnic minority rights, and political dialogue and reconciliation.
As the only regional platform that brings all of the key stakeholders to the table, the OSCE plays a vital role in keeping the lines of communication open and finding opportunities for joint action.
Given our good relations with all the key stakeholders in the crisis, Serbia can contribute to the process.
Our chief objectives are preventing the crisis from escalating into a larger conflict, ensuring a sustainable political process, and preserving the inclusive and cooperative nature of the OSCE’s work.
There is little doubt that de-escalation on the ground and visible progress in the Trilateral Contact Group – and the four working groups operating under its auspices – would set the stage for renewed discussions on broader European security issues and the future role of the OSCE.
Given the obvious imperative for cooperative solutions to address transnational and global security threats, this could not be more important.
Simply put, without a shared approach to security and a dedicated joint response, overcoming our current challenges will be virtually impossible.
And, in fact, the situation could worsen considerably, with so-called “frozen” conflicts heating up and reverting to armed confrontation.
As growing instability exacerbates social tensions, ethnic conflict, radicalization, and violent extremism become increasingly likely.
The East-West divide that leaders in Helsinki confronted in 1975 was much wider than the one that that exists today.
Yet, with courage and commitment, they managed to produce a pragmatic compromise based on a set of key principles – a compromise that opened the way for far-reaching cooperation and, indeed, the emergence of today’s interconnected and interdependent world.
Today’s leaders must show similar wisdom and vision, supporting the OSCE’s efforts to revitalize the principles of the Helsinki accord.
This will require increased investment of both financial resources and political capital – and a shared commitment to put that investment to good use.
Serbia, a post-conflict society built on a series of compromises, is well placed to coordinate Europe’s much-needed security dialogue during its chairmanship of the OSCE – an organization that helped us through our own transition.
What better advocate is there than one who speaks with conviction gained from personal experience?
The Helsinki principles do not need to be reconsidered; on the contrary, they need to be reaffirmed, strengthened, and safeguarded.
The platform is already in place.
Let us get to work – together.
The Unsustainability of Organic Farming
STANFORD – “Sustainable” has become one of the buzzwords of the twenty-first century.
Increasing numbers of universities offer courses or even programs in “sustainability,” and many large companies boast substantial departments devoted to the subject.
In April, many of the iconic multinational companies in the agriculture/food sector were represented at a three-day “Sustainable Product Expo,” convened by Wal-Mart – the largest retailer in the United States – at its Arkansas headquarters.
But, as with many vague, feel-good concepts, “sustainability” contains more than a little sophistry. For example, sustainability in agriculture is often linked to organic farming, whose advocates tout it as a “sustainable” way to feed the planet’s rapidly expanding population.
But what does “sustainable” really mean, and how does it relate to organic methods of food production?
The organic movement’s claims about the sustainability of its methods are dubious.
For example, a recent study found that the potential for groundwater contamination can be dramatically reduced if fertilizers are distributed through the irrigation system according to plant demand during the growing season; organic farming, however, depends on compost, the release of which is not matched to plant demand.
Moreover, though composting receives good press as a “green” practice, it generates a significant amount of greenhouse gases (and is often a source of pathogenic bacteria in crops).
The study also found that “intensive organic agriculture relying on solid organic matter, such as composted manure that is mixed in to the soil prior to planting, resulted in significant down-leaching of nitrate” into groundwater.
Increasing the nitrate levels in groundwater is hardly a hallmark of sustainability, especially with many of the world’s most fertile farming regions in the throes of drought.
A fundamental reason that organic food production is far less “sustainable” than many forms of conventional farming is that organic farms, though possibly well adapted for certain local environments on a small scale, produce far less food per unit of land and water.
The low yields of organic agriculture – typically 20-50% below conventional agriculture – impose various stresses on farmland, especially on water consumption.
A British meta-analysis published in 2012 identified some of the stresses that were higher in organic agriculture.
For example, it found that “ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit were higher from organic systems,” as were “land use, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential per product unit.”
Lower crop yields in organic farming are largely inevitable, owing to the arbitrary rejection of various advanced methods and technologies.
Organic practices afford limited pesticide options, create difficulties in meeting peak fertilizer demand, and rule out access to genetically engineered varieties.
If organic production were scaled up significantly, the lower yields would lead to greater pressure to convert land to agricultural use and produce more animals for manure, to say nothing of the tighter squeeze on water supplies – all of which are challenges to sustainability.
Another limitation of organic production is that it works against the best approach to enhancing soil quality – namely, the minimization of soil disturbance (such as that caused by plowing or tilling), combined with the use of cover crops.
Such farming systems have many environmental advantages, particularly with respect to limiting erosion and the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides.
Organic growers do frequently plant cover crops, but in the absence of effective herbicides, they often rely on tillage (or even labor-intensive hand weeding) for weed control.
At the same time, organic producers do use insecticides and fungicides to protect their crops, despite the green myth that they do not.
More than 20 chemicals (mostly containing copper and sulfur) are commonly used in growing and processing organic crops – all acceptable under US rules for certifying organic products.
Perhaps the most illogical and least sustainable aspect of organic farming in the long term is the exclusion of “genetically engineered” (also known as “genetically modified,” or GM) plants – but only those that were modified with the most precise techniques and predictable results.
Except for wild berries and wild mushrooms, virtually all the fruits, vegetables, and grains in European and North American diets have been genetically improved by one technique or another – often as a result of seeds being irradiated or undergoing hybridizations that move genes from one species or genus to another in ways that do not occur in nature.
The exclusion from organic agriculture of organisms simply because they were crafted with modern, superior techniques makes no sense.
It not only denies farmers improved seeds, but also denies consumers of organic goods access to nutritionally improved foods, such as oils with enhanced levels of omega-3 fatty acids.
In recent decades, conventional agriculture has become more environmentally friendly and sustainable than ever before.
But that reflects science-based research and old-fashioned technological ingenuity on the part of farmers, plant breeders, and agribusiness companies, not irrational opposition to modern insecticides, herbicides, genetic engineering, and “industrial agriculture.”
More Crop for the Drop
STANFORD – The United Nations has called drought the “world’s costliest natural disaster,” both financially, imposing an annual cost of $6-8 billion, and in human terms; since 1900, it has affected two billion people, leading to more than 11 million deaths.
That is because so much of the world is vulnerable; currently affected areas include Australia, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, North and South America, and the Middle East.
Given that agriculture accounts for 70% of water consumption, on average, worldwide, it seems logical that this sector should be the focus of conservation measures.
And, in fact, a proven technology exists that could go a long way toward reducing the impact of drought: genetic engineering (GE).
Sometimes called “genetic modification,” GE enables plant breeders to make existing crop plants do new things – such as conserve water.
Even with research and development hampered by resistance from activists and excessive government regulation, drought-resistant GE crop varieties are emerging from the development pipeline in many parts of the world.
Over the last two decades, such crop varieties have been cultivated on more than 1.5 billion hectares by more than 17 million farmers in some 30 countries – without disrupting a single ecosystem or causing so much as a stomachache.
Worldwide, these new varieties have provided “very significant net economic benefits at the farm level, amounting to $18.8 billion in 2012 and $116.6 billion” from 1996 to 2012, according to a recent report by Landes Bioscience.
Most of these new crop varieties are designed to resist herbicides, so that farmers can adopt more environmentally friendly, no-till cultivation practices, and many have also been engineered to resist pests and diseases that ravage crops.
Others have higher nutritional value, making them ideally suited for developing-country populations that struggle to acquire the nutrients they need to lead healthy, productive lives.
But, in the long term, the greatest boon of all, for both food security and the environment, will likely be the ability of new crop varieties to tolerate periods of drought and other water-related stresses.
Even a small reduction in the amount of water used for irrigation could have huge benefits, especially in drought conditions.
To develop such varieties, plant biologists identified genes that regulate water use and transferred them into important crop plants, enabling them to grow with less or lower-quality water, such as water that has been recycled or is high in natural mineral salts.
Egyptian researchers have shown that by transferring a single gene from barley to wheat, the plants can tolerate reduced watering for a longer period of time.
This new, drought-resistant variety requires only one-eighth as much irrigation as conventional wheat; in some deserts, it can be cultivated with rainfall alone.
Other types of GE crop varieties, such as those that are disease- and pest-resistant, indirectly improve the efficiency of water use.
Because much of the loss to diseases and pests occurs after the plants are fully grown – that is, after most of the water required for their growth has already been supplied – resistance to them means more agricultural output per unit of water invested.
In short, farmers can get more crop for the drop.
Molecular genetic engineering technology can conserve water in other ways as well.
One-third of irrigated land worldwide is not suitable for growing crops because of the presence of salt – the result of repeated fertilization.
To regain the more than 200,000 hectares of irrigated land that is lost to cultivation annually, scientists have enhanced the salt tolerance of crops as diverse as tomatoes and canola.
The transformed plants can grow in salty soil and be irrigated with brackish water, conserving fresh water for other uses.
Given the benefits, one might expect such developments to be universally lauded and encouraged.
But they face major regulatory obstacles.
Europe, for example, largely prohibits GE crops; India has approved insect-resistant cotton but has failed to sanction any food crops.
Even&nbsp;where GE crops are being cultivated, unscientific, excessively burdensome regulation has raised the cost of producing new plant varieties significantly, keeping many potentially important ones from the market.
These measures are irrational, because they are inversely related to risk.
They permit the largely unregulated use of new varieties of plants and microorganisms that have been crafted with less precise and predictable techniques, under the pretense that they are somehow more “natural,” while stringently regulating – or even banning – those based on the most advanced knowledge and methods.
As water scarcity increases, drought-stricken crops wither, and food prices rise, the need for resilient agriculture will become more obvious – and more urgent.
With more rational public policy, we can meet that need now.
How much more preventable misery and death must occur before our policymakers see reason?
The Myth of Organic Agriculture
STANFORD – Organic products – from food to skin-care nostrums to cigarettes – are very much in vogue, with the global market for organic food alone now reportedly exceeding $60 billion annually.
The views of organic devotees seem to be shared by the European Commission, whose official view of organic farming and foods is, “Good for nature, good for you.”
But there is no persuasive evidence of either.
A 2012 meta-analysis of data from 240 studies concluded that organic fruits and vegetables were, on average, no more nutritious than their cheaper conventional counterparts; nor were they less likely to be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria like E. coli or salmonella – a finding that surprised even the researchers.
“When we began this project,” said Dena Bravata, one of the researchers, “we thought that there would likely be some findings that would support the superiority of organics over conventional food.”
Many people purchase organic foods in order to avoid exposure to harmful levels of pesticides.
But that is a poor rationale.
While non-organic fruits and vegetables had more pesticide residue, the levels in more than 99% of cases did not cross the conservative safety thresholds set by regulators.
Moreover, the vast majority of the pesticidal substances found on produce occur “naturally” in people’s diets, through organic and conventional foods.
The biochemist Bruce Ames and his colleagues have found that “99.99% (by weight) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves.
Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half (27) are rodent carcinogens; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods.”
The bottom line is that natural chemicals are just as likely as synthetic versions to test positive in animal cancer studies, and “at the low doses of most human exposures, the comparative hazards of synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant.”
In other words, consumers who buy expensive organic foods in order to avoid pesticide exposure are focusing their attention on 0.01% of the pesticides that they consume.
Ironically, in both Europe and North America, the designation “organic” is itself a synthetic bureaucratic construct – and it makes little sense.
It prohibits the use of synthetic chemical pesticides, with some pragmatic exceptions.
For example, the EU’s policy notes that “foreseen flexibility rules” can compensate for “local climatic, cultural, or structural differences.”
When suitable alternatives are lacking, some (strictly enumerated) synthetic chemicals are allowed.
Similarly, in the US, there is a lengthy list of specific exceptions to the prohibitions.
But most “natural” pesticides – as well as pathogen-laden animal excreta, for use as fertilizer – are permitted.
Another rationale for buying organic is that it is supposedly better for the natural environment.
But the low yields of organic agriculture in real-world settings – typically 20-50% below yields from conventional agriculture – impose various stresses on farmland and increase water consumption substantially.
According to a recent British meta-analysis, ammonia emissions, nitrogen leaching, and nitrous-oxide emissions per unit of output were higher in organic systems than in conventional agriculture, as were land use and the potential for eutrophication – adverse ecosystem responses to the addition of fertilizers and wastes – and acidification.
An anomaly of how “organic” is defined is that the designation does not actually focus on the food’s quality, composition, or safety. Rather, it comprises a set of acceptable practices and procedures that a farmer intends to use.
For example, chemical pesticide or pollen from genetically engineered plants wafting from an adjacent field onto an organic crop does not affect the harvest’s status.
EU rules are clear that food may be labeled as organic as long as “the ingredients containing [genetically modified organisms] entered the products unintentionally” and amount to less than 0.9% of their content.
Finally, many who are seduced by the romance of organic farming ignore its human consequences.
American farmer Blake Hurst offers this reminder: “Weeds continue to grow, even in polycultures with holistic farming methods, and, without pesticides, hand weeding is the only way to protect a crop.”
The backbreaking drudgery of hand weeding often falls to women and children.
Of course, organic products should be available for people who feel that they must have and can afford them.
But the simple truth is that buying non-organic is far more cost-effective, more humane, and more environmentally responsible.
The GMO Stigma
STANFORD – In August, at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, a group of activists vandalized test fields of so-called “golden rice,” which has been genetically engineered to contain beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. Some of the perpetrators were even supported by the Swedish government’s International Development Cooperation Agency via its funding of the radical Filipino group MASIPAG.
For poor people whose diet is composed largely of rice – a carbohydrate-rich but vitamin-poor source of calories – “biofortified” strains are invaluable.
In developing countries, 200-300 million preschool children are at risk of vitamin A deficiency, which compromises immune systems, increasing the body’s susceptibility to illnesses like measles and diarrheal diseases.
Every year, vitamin A deficiency causes blindness in about a half-million children; some 70% of them die within a year.
In September, an eminent group of scientists called upon the scientific community to “stand together in staunch opposition to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances, such as golden rice, that have the potential to save millions” of people from “needless suffering and death.”
But this passionate appeal fails to address the fundamental problem: the unfounded notion that there is a meaningful difference between “genetically modified organisms” and their conventional counterparts.
The fact is that GMOs and their derivatives do not amount to a “category” of food products.
They are neither less safe nor less “natural” than other common foods.
Labeling foods derived from GMOs, as some have proposed, thus implies a meaningful difference where none exists – an issue that even regulators have acknowledged.
Humans have been engaging in “genetic modification” through selection and hybridization for millennia.
Breeders routinely use radiation or chemical mutagens on seeds to scramble a plant’s DNA and generate new traits.
A half-century of “wide cross” hybridizations, which involve the movement of genes from one species or genus to another, has given rise to plants – including everyday varieties of corn, oats, pumpkin, wheat, black currants, tomatoes, and potatoes – that do not and could not exist in nature.
Indeed, with the exception of wild berries, wild game, wild mushrooms, and fish and shellfish, virtually everything in North American and European diets has been genetically improved in some way.
Despite the lack of scientific justification for skepticism about genetically engineered crops – indeed, no cases of harm to humans or disruption to ecosystems have been documented – they have been the most scrutinized foods in human history.
The assumption that “genetically engineered” or “genetically modified” is a meaningful – and dangerous – classification has led not only to vandalism of field trials, but also to destruction of laboratories and assaults on researchers.
Moreover, the GMO classification has encouraged unscientific regulatory approaches that are not commensurate with the level of risk, and that, by discriminating against modern molecular genetic-engineering techniques, inhibit agricultural innovation that could reduce strain on the natural environment and enhance global food security.
Even as study after study – both formal risk assessments and “real-world” observations – has confirmed the technology’s safety, the regulatory burden placed on GMOs has continued to grow.
This trend is making the testing and development of many crops with commercial and humanitarian potential economically unfeasible.
Despite robust laboratory research on plants since the invention of modern genetic-engineering techniques in the early 1970’s, the commercialization of products has lagged.
Unprovoked attention from regulators inevitably stigmatizes any product or technology.
Endless discussion of the “coexistence” of genetically engineered and “conventional” organisms has reinforced the stigma, leading activists to pursue frivolous yet damaging litigation.
For example, in at least four lawsuits brought against regulators in the United States, judges initially ruled that regulators had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the US National Environmental Policy Act.
And marketing as “natural” products that contain genetically engineered ingredients has led to lawsuits for false labeling.
The discriminatory treatment of GMOs creates widespread mischief.
In many places, the location of field trials now must be identified, even including GPS coordinates – a practice that facilitates vandalism.
(And activists frequently destroy conventional plants inadvertently, because they are difficult to distinguish from genetically engineered varieties.)
In 1936, the Nobel laureate Max Planck observed that scientific innovations rarely spread as a result of their opponents’ conversion; instead, opponents of innovation “gradually die out,” and the next generation accepts the breakthrough.
This was the case with vaccinations and the recognition that DNA is the stuff of heredity – and it will happen eventually with genetic engineering.
Unfortunately, many will suffer needlessly in the interim.
As University of California agricultural economist David Zilberman and his colleagues have written, the lost benefits are “irreversible, both in the sense that past harvests have been lower than they would have been if the technology had been introduced and in the sense that yield growth is a cumulative process of which the onset has been delayed.”
As long as today’s activists and regulators remain convinced that GMOs represent a distinct and dangerous category of research and products, genetic engineering will fall short of its potential.
That is bad news for the millions of poor people for whom genetic engineering in agriculture, medicine, and environmental science could offer a healthier, more secure future.
Governing a World Out of Order
WASHINGTON, DC – Can we develop an international order that will keep the peace and allow countries to play by agreed rules?
That is the question that Henry Kissinger poses in his new book World Order.
Unfortunately, it is the wrong question.
Kissinger defines “world order” as a concept of just international arrangements that is “thought to be applicable to the entire world.”
Before the advent of the European Union, for example, Europe conceived of world order as a balance of great powers, in which multiple religions and forms of government could coexist.
As a civilization and a religion, Islam envisions the optimal world order very differently – as a caliphate, in which faith and government are united and peace prevails throughout the Dar al-Islam, or house of Islam.
That is certainly not the belief of all Muslims or of the governments of Muslim-majority states, but the radicalism espoused by groups like the Islamic State seeks to spread not just codes of conduct but an entire worldview.
In Kissinger’s view, contending conceptions of world order are emerging not only in the Middle East, but also in Asia.
China is currently playing by the international rules but is increasingly signaling that it expects to be treated as first among equals in the region (as the US has long insisted with respect to its position in the Americas).
But, as China grows stronger and reclaims what it believes to be its historic position in Asia and the world, how long will it wait to insist on reshaping the international rules?
Russia is openly breaking those rules and no longer bothering to justify itself under international law.
Instead, it boasts of reclaiming territories once ruled by the Kremlin and threatens to use force to “protect” ethnic Russians from purported threats.
When Russia annexed Crimea last March, Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations pointed out the marked difference in the way it handled its invasion of Georgia in 2008.
The Russian government essentially provoked Georgia into attacking first and then crafted an elaborate justification aimed at rendering its actions compatible with international law.
But this time, Kadri wrote, “Moscow has challenged the whole post-Cold War European order, together with its system of rules.”
Kissinger’s hope is that these countries and rising powers like India and presumably Brazil (he leaves Latin America out of his account of world orders) will be able to forge agreement on a set of rules that all will regard as legitimate, thereby maintaining a stable global balance of power.
The Westphalian principle of multiplicity will be critical, he believes, as it will be necessary to allow different countries and civilizations to operate on very different domestic principles.
An effective world order for the twenty-first century, however, must do much more than keep the peace.
Kissinger focuses on inter-state relations – on how, from one country’s perspective, to avoid war with other countries while deterring them from aggression or other actions likely to upset a regional or global balance of power.
Yet a glance at today’s headlines suggests that what is most likely to kill and displace millions, if not hundreds of millions, of people in the coming decades are global threats such as pandemics, climate change, and terrorist and criminal networks – not inter-state war.
Yes, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to more than 3,000 deaths.
But current projections of the spread of the Ebola virus predict a million cases by January.
According to the World Health Organization, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has killed 36 million people, roughly ten million higher than the estimated number of military deaths in World War II, with an additional 35 million people infected.
Many of these global threats are closely intertwined with war, but war that is far more likely to be fought within borders than across them.
Consider that roughly two-thirds of Syria’s population has been displaced by the country’s civil war, with millions living miserably in refugee camps.
The disastrous state of health care in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where Ebola is raging, reflects decades of horrific civil war in both countries.
The ongoing violence in Africa’s Great Lakes region, which has claimed millions of civilian lives, is rooted in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the resulting flood of Hutu refugees into neighboring states.
The droughts and floods caused by climate change will put millions of people on the move, first into crowded and combustible cities, and then across borders.
Russia and Canada may be happy to receive them as vast new tracts of land open up, but many other parts of the world are already crowded, which spells conflict.
Maintaining peace is mostly a matter of restraint or constraint.
Effective global cooperation requires much more.
Governments must be able to come together, alongside vital actors from both business and civil society, to adopt comprehensive plans of action.
Those plans, in turn, require funding, manpower, collective will, and enforcement capability.
Yet today, faced with a virus that kills half of those it infects and the prospect that it could decimate an entire region of Africa, disrupt air travel, and put people around the world in quarantine, the world has delivered only a fraction of the needed financial and material assistance.
We live in a world of global problems and largely national solutions.
The need for institutions that can respond swiftly and effectively, as domestic government does in well-governed states, is greater than ever.
The post-WWII institutions have become insufficient.
It is time to reform them – and to devise new structures and tools designed to address global problems.
Henry Paulson is Wrong
CHICAGO – When a profitable company is hit by a very large liability, the solution is not to have the government buy its assets at inflated prices.  The solution, instead, is protection under bankruptcy law, which in the United States means Chapter 11.
Under Chapter 11, companies with a solid underlying business generally swap debt for equity.  Old equity holders are wiped out and old debt claims are transformed into equity claims in the new entity which continues operating with a new capital structure.
Alternatively, the debt-holders can agree to reduce the face value of debt, in exchange for some warrants.
So why not use this well-established approach to solve the financial sector’s current problems?
The obvious answer is that we do not have time; Chapter 11 procedures are generally long and complex, and the current crisis has reached a point where time is of the essence.
But we are in extraordinary times, and the government has taken and is prepared to take unprecedented measures.
As if rescuing the big insurer AIG and prohibiting all short selling of financial stocks was not enough, now US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposes buying up (with taxpayers’ money) the distressed assets of the financial sector.
But at what price?
If banks and financial institutions find it difficult to recapitalize (i.e., issue new equity), it is because investors are uncertain about the value of the assets in their portfolios and do not want to overpay.
Will government do better at valuing those assets?
In a negotiation between government officials and a banker with a bonus at risk, who will have more clout in determining the price?
Paulson’s plan would create a charitable institution that provides welfare to the rich – at taxpayers’ expense.
If the government subsidy is large enough, it will succeed in stopping the crisis.
But, again, at what price?
Aside from costing billions of taxpayer dollars, Paulson’s plan violates the fundamental capitalist principle that whoever reaps the gains also bears the losses.
Remember that in America’s Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980’s, the government had to bail out those institutions, because their deposits were federally insured.
But in this case, the government does not have to bail out the debt-holders of Bear Sterns, AIG, or any of the other financial institutions that will benefit from Paulson’s plan.
Since we do not have time for Chapter 11 proceedings and we do not want to bail out all the creditors, the lesser evil is to do what judges do in contentious and overextended bankruptcy processes: impose a restructuring plan on creditors, with part of the debt forgiven in exchange for equity or warrants.
There is precedent for such a bold move.
During the Great Depression, many debt contracts were indexed to gold.
So when the dollar’s convertibility into gold was suspended, the value of that debt soared, threatening many institutions’ survival.
President Roosevelt’s administration declared the clause invalid, forcing debt forgiveness.
My colleague and current Fed Governor Randall Koszner studied this episode and showed that not only stock prices, but also bond prices, soared after the Supreme Court upheld the decision.
How is that possible?
As corporate finance experts have been saying for 30 years, having too much debt and too little equity is costly, so reducing the face value of debt can sometimes benefit not only equity-holders, but also debt-holders.
But, while debt forgiveness benefits holders of both equity and debt, debt-holders don’t voluntarily agree to it for two reasons.
First, even if each individual debt-holder benefits, he or she will benefit even more if everybody else cuts the face value of their debt and he or she does not.
Hence, everybody waits for others to move first, creating obvious delay.
Second, from a debt-holder’s point of view, a government bailout is better.
Even talk of a government bailout reduces the debt-holders’ incentive to act, making the bailout more necessary.
As during the Great Depression and in many debt restructurings, it makes sense in the current contingency to mandate partial debt forgiveness or a debt-for-equity swap in the financial sector.
It is a well-tested strategy, and it leaves taxpayers out of the picture.
Forcing a debt-for-equity swap or debt forgiveness would be no greater a violation of private property rights than a massive bailout.
But, for the major players in the financial sector, it is much more appealing to be bailed out by the taxpayers.
Indeed, for the financial industry, the appeal of Paulson’s proposal is precisely that it taxes the many and benefits the few.
Since the many (taxpayers) are dispersed, we cannot put up a good fight in the US Congress, whereas the financial industry is well represented politically.
For six of the last 13 years, the Treasury Secretary was a Goldman Sachs alumnus.
The decisions that Congress must make now will affect not only the US economy’s short-term prospects, but will shape the type of capitalism that we will have for the next 50 years.
Do we want to live in a system where profits are private, but losses are socialized, where taxpayer money is used to prop up failed firms?
Or do we want to live in a system where people are held accountable for their decisions, where imprudent behavior is penalized and prudent behavior rewarded?
For anyone who believes in free markets, the most serious risk of the current situation is that the interest of a few financiers will undermine the capitalist system’s fundamental workings.
The time has come to save capitalism from the capitalists.
How Safe Substances Become Dangerous
PALO ALTO – Since the development of the science of toxicology in the sixteenth century, its guiding principle has been that “the dose makes the poison.”
It is a rule that applies to the medicines used by patients worldwide many billions of times a day.
The right dose of aspirin can be a therapeutic godsend, but consuming too much can be lethal.
The principle even applies to foods: Large amounts of nutmeg or licorice are notoriously toxic.
The risk that a substance poses broadly depends on two factors: its inherent capacity to cause harm and one’s exposure to it.
It is a simple idea, but even some presumptive professionals seem unable to grasp it – as evidenced by the decision by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization, to classify the commonly used herbicide 2,4-D as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.”
When it comes to herbicides, the IARC seems to be on a losing streak.
The organization recently classified glyphosate, another popular herbicide, as “probably” carcinogenic, a conclusion at odds with those of regulatory agencies around the world.
Similarly, not a single governmental agency has deemed 2,4-D a carcinogen.
Earlier this year, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that “based on weight of evidence consideration of the available data, 2,4-D would be classified as ‘Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.’”
The European Food Safety Authority also recently concluded that “2,4-D, as currently manufactured, is unlikely to have a genotoxic potential or pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.”
The decision by the IARC to classify substances like 2,4-D and glyphosate as potentially harmful is likely to cause alarm among farmers and consumers, who will wonder about the appropriateness of its continued use in commercial agriculture or gardening.
This would be a shame, because these are highly effective and widely used herbicides, and when the IARC makes its decisions, it does not consider whether the substance in question is actually likely to cause cancer in the real world.
Its panels do not assess whether a chemical will cause cancer – only if it is capable of causing cancer.
As a result, the IARC has in the past classified aloe vera, acrylamide (a substance created by frying foods, such as French fries and potato chips), cell phones, working night shifts, Asian pickled vegetables, and coffee as “probable” or “possible” carcinogens.
This is because it ignores the dosage, failing to consider the likelihood of coming into contact with enough of the substance to cause actual harm.
In the case of coffee, for example, one would need to drink more than 50 cups a day, for an extended period of time, before any deleterious effects became likely.
Classifying 2,4-D as a cancer risk to humans ignores extensive research and analysis conducted by health authorities worldwide, including the United Nations WHO/FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residue (JMPR).
This body evaluates the risks of substances like 2,4-D, considering real-world variables such as the amounts in soil and nearby water, exposure to animals passing through treated fields, and the potential for direct human contact.
In reviews beginning in 1970, the JMPR has always found that when 2,4-D is applied correctly, it does not pose a health threat to anyone or anything on land or water.
This finding has been affirmed by numerous government agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority, the EPA, the US Department of Agriculture, and Health Canada.
When the IARC, which restricts its panels to consider only a narrow spectrum of selected publications, makes a mistaken decision, the effects are harmful.
Its rulings give credibility to chemophobic activists looking for headlines and raise the likelihood that substances wrongly labeled as harmful will be replaced by other products that could pose greater risks or provide fewer benefits.
If products such as glyphosate and 2,4-D were to become unavailable, farmers would be forced to resort to other methods to control weeds – none of them as efficient.
Indeed, many of the alternatives would be more toxic or require more tillage, resulting in damaging soil erosion, increased CO2 emissions, decreased crop yields, greater production costs, and higher consumer prices.
Nor would the problem be limited to farmers.
There are more than 100 prescribed uses for 2,4-D, including the control of invasive weeds on lawns, in forestry, and to enhance safety along highways, power line corridors, and rail lines.
The process the IARC uses in coming to conclusions is not only scientifically wrong; it is harmful.
Its decisions, which have wide exposure, pose the greatest risk to human and other animal life – at any dose.
Overdosing on Heterodoxy Can Kill You
CAMBRIDGE – Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, it has been common to chastise economists for not having predicted the disaster, for having offered the wrong prescriptions to prevent it, or for having failed to fix it after it happened.
The call for new economic thinking has been persistent – and justified.
But all that is new may not be good, and that all that is good may not be new.
The 50th anniversary of China’s Cultural Revolution is a reminder of what can happen when all orthodoxy is tossed out the window.
Venezuela’s current catastrophe is another: A country that should be rich is suffering the world’s deepest recession, highest inflation, and worst deterioration of social indicators.
Its citizens, who live on top of the world’s largest oil reserves, are literally starving and dying for lack of food and medicine.
While this disaster was brewing, Venezuela won accolades from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, the Economic Commission for Latin America, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the US Center for Economic Policy Research, among others.
So what should the world learn from the country’s descent into misery?
In short, Venezuela is the poster child of the perils of rejecting economic fundamentals.
One of those fundamentals is the idea that, to achieve social goals, it is better to use – rather than repress – the market.
After all, the market is essentially just a form of self-organization whereby everyone tries to earn a living by doing things that others find valuable.
In most countries, people buy food, soap, and toilet paper without incurring a national policy nightmare, as has happened in Venezuela.
But suppose you do not like the outcome the market generates.
Standard economic theory suggests that you can affect it by taxing some transactions – such as, say, greenhouse-gas emissions – or giving money to certain groups of people, while letting the market do its thing.
An alternative tradition, going back to Saint Thomas Aquinas, held that prices should be “just.”
Economics has shown that this is a really bad idea, because prices are the information system that creates incentives for suppliers and customers to decide what and how much to make or buy.
Making prices “just” nullifies this function, leaving the economy in perpetual shortage.
In Venezuela, the Law of Just Costs and Prices is one reason why farmers do not plant.
For that reason, agro-processing firms shut down.
More generally, price controls create incentives to flip goods into the black market.
As a result, the country with the world’s most extensive system of price controls also has the highest inflation – as well as an ever-expanding police effort that jails retail managers for holding inventories and even closes the borders to prevent smuggling.
Fixing prices is a short dead-end street.
A longer one is subsidizing goods so that their price remains below cost.
These so-called indirect subsidies can quickly cause an immense economic mess.
In Venezuela, subsidies for gasoline and electricity are larger than the budget for education and health care combined; exchange-rate subsidies are in a class of their own.
With one daily minimum wage in Venezuela, you can buy barely a half-pound (227 grams) of beef or 12 eggs, or 1,000 liters (264 gallons) of gasoline or 5,100 kWh of electricity – enough to power a small town.
With the proceeds of selling a dollar at the black market rate, you can buy over $100 at the strongest official rate.
Under these conditions, you are unlikely to find goods or dollars at official prices.
Moreover, since the government is unable to pay providers the necessary subsidy to keep prices low, output collapses, as has happened with Venezuela’s electricity and health sectors, among others.
Indirect subsidies are also regressive, because the rich consume more than the poor – and hence appropriate more of the subsidy.
This is what underpins the old orthodox wisdom that if you want to change market outcomes, it is better to subsidize people directly with cash.
Another bit of conventional wisdom is that creating the right incentive structure and securing the necessary know-how to run state-owned enterprises is very difficult.
So the state should have only a few firms in strategic sectors or in activities that are rife with market failures.
Venezuela disregarded that wisdom and went on an expropriation binge.
In particular, after former President Hugo Chávez was reelected in 2006, he expropriated farms, supermarkets, banks, telecoms, power companies, oil production and service firms, and manufacturing companies producing steel, cement, coffee, yogurt, detergent, and even glass bottles.
Productivity collapsed in all of them.
Governments often struggle to balance their books, leading to over-indebtedness and financial trouble.
Yet fiscal prudence is one of the most frequently attacked principles of economic orthodoxy.
But Venezuela shows what happens when prudence is frowned upon and fiscal information is treated as a state secret.
Venezuela used the 2004-2013 oil boom to quintuple its external public debt, instead of saving up for a rainy day.
By 2013, Venezuela’s extravagant borrowing led international capital markets to shut it out, leading the authorities to print money.
This caused the currency to lose 98% of its value in the last three years.
By the time oil prices fell in 2014, the country was in no position to take the hit, with collapsing domestic production and capacity to import, leading to the current disaster.
Orthodoxy reflects history’s painfully acquired lessons – the sum of what we regard to be true.
But not all of it is true.
Progress requires identifying errors, which in turn calls for heterodox thinking.
But learning becomes difficult when there are long delays between action and consequences, as when we try to regulate the water temperature while in the shower.
When reaction times are slow, exploring the heterodox is necessary, but should be done with care.
When all orthodoxy is thrown out the window, you get the disaster that was the Chinese Cultural Revolution – and that is today’s Venezuela.
The Hidden Debt Burden of Emerging Markets
LIMA – As central bankers and finance ministers from around the globe gather for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings here in Peru, the emerging world is rife with symptoms of increasing economic vulnerability.
Gone are the days when IMF meetings were monopolized by the problems of the advanced economies struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
Now, the discussion has shifted back toward emerging economies, which face the risk of financial crises of their own.
While no two financial crises are identical, all tend to share some telltale symptoms: a significant slowdown in economic growth and exports, the unwinding of asset-price booms, growing current-account and fiscal deficits, rising leverage, and a reduction or outright reversal in capital inflows.
To varying degrees, emerging economies are now exhibiting all of them.
The turning point came in 2013, when the expectation of rising interest rates in the United States and falling global commodity prices brought an end to a multi-year capital-inflow bonanza that had been supporting emerging economies’ growth.
China’s recent slowdown, by fueling turbulence in global capital markets and weakening commodity prices further, has exacerbated the downturn throughout the emerging world.
These challenges, while difficult to address, are at least discernible.
But emerging economies may also be experiencing another common symptom of an impending crisis, one that is much tougher to detect and measure: hidden debts.
Sometimes connected with graft, hidden debts do not usually appear on balance sheets or in standard databases.
Their features morph from one crisis to the next, as do the players involved in their creation.
As a result, they often go undetected, until it is too late.
Indeed, it was not until after the eruption of the 1994-1995 peso crisis that the world learned that Mexico’s private banks had taken on a significant amount of currency risk through off-balance-sheet borrowing (derivatives).
Likewise, before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the IMF and financial markets were unaware that Thailand’s central-bank reserves had been nearly depleted (the $33 billion total that was reported did not account for commitments in forward contracts, which left net reserves of only about $1 billion).
And, until Greece’s crisis in 2010, the country’s fiscal deficits and debt burden were thought to be much smaller than they were, thanks to the use of financial derivatives and creative accounting by the Greek government.
So the great question today is where emerging-economy debts are hiding.
And, unfortunately, there are severe obstacles to exposing them – beginning with the opaqueness of China’s financial transactions with other emerging economies over the past decade.
During its domestic infrastructure boom, China financed major projects – often connected to mining, energy, and infrastructure – in other emerging economies.
Given that the lending was denominated primarily in US dollars, it is subject to currency risk, adding another dimension of vulnerability to emerging-economy balance sheets.
But the extent of that lending is largely unknown, because much of it came from development banks in China that are not included in the data collected by the Bank for International Settlements (the primary global source for such information).
And, because the loans were rarely issued as securities in international capital markets, it is not included in, say, World Bank databases, either.
Even where data exist, the figures must be interpreted with care.
For example, data collected on a project-by-project basis by the Global Economic Governance Initiative and the Inter-American Dialog could provide some insight into Chinese lending to several Latin American economies.
For example, it seems that, from 2009 to 2014, total Chinese lending to Venezuela amounted to 18% of the country’s annual GDP, and Ecuador received Chinese loans exceeding 10% of its GDP.
Chinese lending to Brazil was closer to 1% of GDP, while lending to Mexico was comparatively trivial.
But actual disbursements may have fallen short of the original plans, meaning that these countries’ debts to China are lower than estimated.
Alternatively – and more likely – the data may not include some projects, lenders, or borrowers, meaning that the debts could be much higher.
Moreover, other forms of borrowing – such as trade finance, which is skewed toward shorter maturities – are not included in these figures.
Currency-swap agreements, which have been important for Brazil and Argentina, must also be added to the list.
(This highlights the importance of tracking net, rather than gross, reserves.)
In short, though emerging economies’ debts seem largely moderate by historic standards, it seems likely that they are being underestimated, perhaps by a large margin.
If so, the magnitude of the ongoing reversal in capital flows that emerging economies are experiencing may be larger than is generally believed – potentially large enough to trigger a crisis.
In this context, keeping track of opaque and evolving financial linkages is more important than ever.
High Anxiety
CHICAGO – The United States has reached a point where almost half its population is described as being in some way mentally ill, and nearly a quarter of its citizens – 67.5 million – have taken antidepressants.
These eye-popping statistics have sparked a widespread, sometimes rancorous debate about whether people are taking far more medication than is needed for problems that may not even be mental disorders.
Studies indicate that 40% of all patients fall short of the diagnoses that doctors and psychiatrists give them, yet 200 million prescriptions are still written annually in the US to treat depression and anxiety.
Those who defend such widespread use of prescription drugs insist that a significant part of the population is under-treated and, by inference, under-medicated.
Those opposed to such rampant use of drugs note that diagnostic rates for bipolar disorder, in particular, have skyrocketed by 4,000% and that overmedication is impossible without over-diagnosis.
To help settle this long-standing dispute, I studied why the number of recognized psychiatric disorders has ballooned so dramatically in recent decades.
In 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders added 112 new mental disorders to its third edition ( DSM-III ).
Fifty-eight more disorders appeared in the revised third (1987) and fourth (1994) editions.
With over a million copies in print, the manual is known as the bible of American psychiatry; certainly it is an invoked chapter and verse in schools, prisons, courts, and by mental-health professionals around the world.
The addition of even one new diagnostic code has serious practical consequences.
What, then, was the rationale for adding so many in 1980?
After several requests to the American Psychiatric Association, I was granted complete access to the hundreds of unpublished memos, letters, and even votes from the period between 1973 and 1979, when the DSM-III task force debated each new and existing disorder.
Some of the work was meticulous and commendable.
But the overall approval process was more capricious than scientific.
DSM-III grew out of meetings that many participants described as chaotic.
One observer later remarked that the small amount of research drawn upon was “really a hodgepodge –scattered, inconsistent, and ambiguous.”
The interest and expertise of the task force was limited to one branch of psychiatry: neuropsychiatry.
That group met for four years before it occurred to members that such one-sidedness might result in bias.
Incredibly, the lists of symptoms for some disorders were knocked out in minutes.
The field studies used to justify their inclusion sometimes involved a single patient evaluated by the person advocating the new disease.
Experts pressed for the inclusion of illnesses as questionable as “chronic undifferentiated unhappiness disorder” and “chronic complaint disorder,” whose traits included moaning about taxes, the weather, and even sports results.
Social phobia (later dubbed “social anxiety disorder”) was one of seven new anxiety disorders created in 1980.
At first it struck me as a serious condition.
By the 1990’s experts were calling it “the disorder of the decade,” insisting that as many as one in five Americans suffers from it.
Yet the complete story turned out to be rather more complicated.
For starters, the specialist who in the 1960’s originally recognized social anxiety (London-based Isaac Marks, a renowned expert on fear and panic) strongly resisted its inclusion in DSM-III as a separate disease category.
The list of common behaviors associated with the disorder gave him pause: fear of eating alone in restaurants, avoidance of public toilets, and concern about trembling hands.
By the time a revised task force added dislike of public speaking in 1987, the disorder seemed sufficiently elastic to include virtually everyone on the planet.
To counter the impression that it was turning common fears into treatable conditions, DSM-IV added a clause stipulating that social anxiety behaviors had to be “impairing” before a diagnosis was possible.
But who was holding the prescribers to such standards?
Doubtless, their understanding of impairment was looser than that of the task force.
After all, despite the impairment clause, the anxiety disorder mushroomed; by 2000, it was the third most common psychiatric disorder in America, behind only depression and alcoholism.
Over-medication would affect fewer Americans if we could rein in such clear examples of over-diagnosis.
We would have to set the thresholds for psychiatric diagnosis a lot higher, resurrecting the distinction between chronic illness and mild suffering.
But there is fierce resistance to this by those who say they are fighting grave mental disorders, for which medication is the only viable treatment.
Failure to reform psychiatry will be disastrous for public health.
Consider that apathy, excessive shopping, and overuse of the Internet are all serious contenders for inclusion in the next edition of the DSM, due to appear in 2012.
If the history of psychiatry is any guide, a new class of medication will soon be touted to treat them.
Sanity must prevail: if everyone is mentally ill, then no one is.
When Interest Rates Rise
CAMBRIDGE – Long-term interest rates are now unsustainably low, implying bubbles in the prices of bonds and other securities.
When interest rates rise, as they surely will, the bubbles will burst, the prices of those securities will fall, and anyone holding them will be hurt.
To the extent that banks and other highly leveraged financial institutions hold them, the bursting bubbles could cause bankruptcies and financial-market breakdown.
The very low interest rate on long-term United States Treasury bonds is a clear example of the current mispricing of financial assets.
A ten-year Treasury has a nominal interest rate of less than 2%.
Because the inflation rate is also about 2%, this implies a negative real interest rate, which is confirmed by the interest rate of -0.6% on ten-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which adjust interest and principal payments for inflation.
Historically, the real interest rate on ten-year Treasuries has been above 2%; thus, today’s rate is about two percentage points below its historical average.
But those historical rates prevailed at times when fiscal deficits and federal government debt were much lower than they are today.
With budget deficits that are projected to be 5% of GDP by the end of the coming decade, and a debt/GDP ratio that has roughly doubled in the past five years and is continuing to grow, the real interest rate on Treasuries should be significantly higher than it was in the past.
The reason for today’s unsustainably low long-term rates is not a mystery.
The Federal Reserve’s policy of “long-term asset purchases,” also known as “quantitative easing,” has intentionally kept long-term rates low.
The Fed is buying Treasury bonds and long-term mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $85 billion a month, equivalent to an annual rate of $1,020 billion.
Since that exceeds the size of the government deficit, it implies that private markets do not need to buy any of the newly issued government debt.
The Fed has indicated that it will eventually end its program of long-term asset purchases and allow rates to rise to more normal levels.
Although it has not indicated just when rates will rise or how high they will go, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the rate on ten-year Treasuries will rise above 5% by 2019 and remain above that level for the next five years.
The interest rates projected by the CBO assume that future inflation will be only 2.2%.
If inflation turns out to be higher (a very likely outcome of the Fed’s recent policy), the interest rate on long-term bonds could be correspondingly higher.
Investors are buying long-term bonds at the current low interest rates because the interest rate on short-term investments is now close to zero.
In other words, buyers are getting an additional 2% current yield in exchange for assuming the risk of holding long-term bonds.
That is likely to be a money-losing strategy unless an investor is sagacious or lucky enough to sell the bond before interest rates rise.
If not, the loss in the price of the bond would more than wipe out the extra interest that he earned, even if rates remain unchanged for five years.
Here is how the arithmetic works for an investor who rolls over ten-year bonds for the next five years, thus earning 2% more each year than he would by investing in Treasury bills or bank deposits.
Assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged for the next five years and then rises from 2% to 5%.
During those five years, the investor earns an additional 2% each year, for a cumulative gain of 10%.
But when the interest rate on a ten-year bond rises to 5%, the bond’s price falls from $100 to $69.
The investor loses $31 on the price of the bond, or three times more than he had gained in higher interest payments.
The low interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds has also boosted demand for other long-term assets that promise higher yields, including equities, farm land, high-yield corporate bonds, gold, and real estate.
When interest rates rise, the prices of those assets will fall as well.
The Fed has pursued its strategy of low long-term interest rates in the hope of stimulating economic activity.
At this point, the extent of the stimulus seems very small, and the risk of financial bubbles is increasingly worrying.
The US is not the only country with very low or negative real long-term interest rates.
Germany, Britain, and Japan all have similarly low long rates.
And, in each of these countries, it is likely that interest rates will rise during the next few years, imposing losses on holders of long-term bonds and potentially impairing the stability of financial institutions.
Even if the major advanced economies’ current monetary strategies do not lead to rising inflation, we may look back on these years as a time when official policy led to individual losses and overall financial instability.
Reinvigorating Egypt’s Economy
NEWPORT BEACH – Some two years into Egypt’s grass-roots revolution, the country’s economy is in a worrisome downward spiral.
A growing number of people, inside and outside of the country, are starting to blame the revolution itself for derailing an economy that was growing, reducing its external-debt burden, and maintaining a comfortable cushion of international reserves.
Blaming the revolution is the wrong approach to Egypt’s current economic woes.
Yet its appeal to some is understandable, given that the country’s economic situation has continued to worsen over the last few months.
Growth is anemic, unemployment is high, and new investment has fallen off dramatically – all of which complicate already-difficult financial, social, and political conditions.
The result is a growing threat of several vicious circles at once.
Domestic supply disruptions are now fueling inflation and compounding the problems of a subsidy-laden national budget.
They have also aggravated the weakness of external finances, contributing to a sharp drop in international reserves that has been contained only by exceptional loans and deposits from abroad.
Inadequate growth and higher inflation impose a particularly severe burden on Egypt’s most vulnerable.
Public safety nets are overstretched, with too many poor people falling through.
Moreover, other support networks – including income opportunities in tourism, the informal sector, and charitable and family support – are crumbling under the pressure of growing poverty.
This broad set of spiraling difficulties has led credit-rating agencies to slash Egypt’s rating.
It is also discouraging foreign direct investment, as is the discrediting of Egypt’s police forces.
As a result, still more sources of working and investment capital are disrupted, amplifying the impact of domestic capital flight.
None of this facilitates the political reconciliation and national unity that Egypt needs to complete the most difficult of all revolutionary pivots: from dismantling an oppressive past to building a better future.
Indeed, having suffered from post-revolutionary institutional and political dysfunctions, economic decline is now itself fueling these destabilizers.
To be fair, governments – first under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and now under the Muslim Brotherhood – have recognized the challenges.
Their responses, however, have fallen short, following a familiar sequence that begins with waiting for an endogenous bounce and aspiring to self-reliance.
When no miracle arrives, they opt for capital controls and consider asset sales and leases while courting those once viewed as having perpetuated the old order.
The post-revolutionary government’s initial narrative characterized Egypt’s economic malaise as temporary and self-correcting.
Having overthrown Hosni Mubarak’s iron-fisted 30-year-old regime in a remarkably quick and relatively peaceful manner, Egypt’s revolutionary masses were to leave the streets and pursue an all-out drive for economic prosperity and social justice.
Their efforts would be supported by the re-orientation of public institutions (and governance more broadly) away from benefiting the privileged few toward an ethos of service to all of the country’s citizens.
This narrative reflected (understandable) revolutionary exuberance rather than realities on the ground.
It takes years to reform institutions.
Economic and financial transmission lines cannot be rerouted quickly. Discredited businesses cannot be replaced overnight.
Credible political parties are not easy to organize on the fly.
And many of those who bravely fought for freedom had little political experience, placing an even greater premium on great leadership to channel Egyptians’ enormous energy – and their demands for greater social justice – into a shared vision and common purpose.
The resulting power vacuums were filled by those whose prior positions in society gave them an inside track at the time of the popular uprising.
They assumed power with a set of ideas and operating procedures that had to catch up with the new Egypt.
As the economy struggled, optimism gave way to a more defensive and insular view that values self-reliance.
Accompanied by creeping economic controls, the narrative became more nationalistic.
Loyalty, rather than merit, drove key appointments, making policy management even more difficult.
With this approach offering no better chance at success, the country has been pushed back to pursuing measures that, at least in the mind of much of the public, are associated with the old regime.
Securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund has become the principal objective of economic management, coupled with other anxious attempts to raise financing.
But, absent a fundamental policy revamp, the most that this can deliver is a few months of relative financial calm, albeit at a cost for the subsequent future.
What Egypt needs today cannot be provided only by IMF loans and asset leases.
That is the bad news.
The good news is that, as someone who has followed similar cases for more than 30 years, I can say with confidence that Egypt has all the components needed to restore economic and financial stability: resources, people, dynamism, entrepreneurship, location, and regional and global linkages.
Egypt also has a powerful secret weapon that is yet to be fully deployed – a generation of young people who, after years of alienation and repression, believe that they can (and should) influence the country’s destiny.
Already, some are making a notable difference on the ground, attracting widespread admiration.
Egypt is not a country where economic sectors and segments of the population can succeed despite the government.
The government must provide the context to restart the engines of economic recovery; and policies should serve as growth accelerators by providing development gateways for the energetic young, the restive poor, and the pressured middle class.
This brings us back to the interactions between economics, politics, and finance, which are now fueling a tailspin that is harming Egypt’s citizens and threatening their children’s future.
Appropriate political reforms must come first; when they do, Egypt’s economic and financial revival will surprise many with its buoyancy and speed.
Think of a car that can and should achieve great performance based on its strong internal engine.
Egypt is capable of speedy economic growth and durable financial health.
Without determined efforts at political progress and unity, however, it will remain stuck in neutral – and could slip into reverse.
After all, the large bonuses paid to banks’ CEOs as they led their firms to ruin and the economy to the brink of collapse are hard to reconcile with the belief that individuals’ pay has anything to do with their social contributions.
High Noon at the IMF
This month’s International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings in Washington will bring together the world’s top finance ministers and central bankers at a critical juncture for the global economy.
For starters, the roof is starting to collapse on the global housing bubble, as housing markets begin to freeze up not only in the United States, but also in many other countries, such as high-flying Spain.
Moreover, money markets, especially in Europe, remain traumatized by the festering global credit crunch.
Record-high food and energy prices, combined with sharply rising wages in China, are pushing up inflation in much of the world.
Last, but not least, the US productivity boom is decelerating.
These combined pressures will make it far more difficult for central banks to sustain the so-called “Goldilocks” economy (“just right” inflation and growth).
At the same time, the outside world will be looking especially carefully at what, if anything, officials plan to do if the dollar continues to sink.
Though exchange rates are notoriously unpredictable, the best guess is that a slow unwinding of the massive US trade deficit will keep the dollar on a path of gradual long-term decline.
But the fact that several Asian and emerging-market countries are resisting this decline by buying dollars is putting inordinate pressures on the more flexible currencies, such as the euro and the Canadian dollar, which are trading at record levels.
(What are the Chinese planning to do with all their ever-growing $1.4 trillion in reserves?
Do they intend to give foreign athletes paper bags stuffed with dollars as a welcoming present at the Olympic village?)
European leaders are arguing, with some justification, that their exporters are paying the price for America’s huge trade imbalance with Asian and oil-exporting countries.
If the US goes into recession, the acrimony will get a lot worse.
The IMF’s leadership tried to broker a deal over currencies at its April meeting, but without tangible results.
Given that China’s ruling Communists are holding their Party Congress at the same time as the current IMF meetings, a deal seems unlikely now, too.
Yet, given clear inflationary pressures in countries like Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Russia, and notable price spikes in China, the world just might have reached a moment when agreement can be reached.
Let’s hope so.
There could be a real disaster if US growth woes turn today’s mild downward pressures into something much more serious.
The Federal Reserve would be forced to lower interest rates further, making the dollar even less attractive, and the concomitant shift in global demand away from the US, marked by a sharp decline in the US trade balance, would put still more pressure on the dollar.
According to my own calculations in a series of research papers with Maurice Obstfeld, the trade-weighted dollar would likely fall by 20% if a global demand shift (say, due to a US housing recession) were to cut the US trade deficit in half.
In principle, such a depreciation against all of the world’s currencies is manageable.
But if emerging markets force Europe to take all the adjustment, the results would be catastrophic, pushing up the euro to $1.50, $1.60 or beyond, with truly dire consequences for trade.
Indeed, the US Congress has already produced a series of ominous bills aimed at retaliating against China and other countries that engage in one-way currency intervention.
The leading Democratic US presidential candidates have indicated their support.
Fortunately, the IMF recently asserted the right to take action if countries engage in sustained one-way currency intervention.
But will incoming IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn be able to exercise this new power quickly enough to avert a crisis?
The IMF itself, of course, is in a deep crisis, with many questioning its mission and legitimacy.
For better or for worse, however, current circumstances offer an opportunity.
It would be unfortunate if the finance ministers merely sit around and beg Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet to rescue them with rate cuts.
It would be even worse if European ministers, frustrated with gridlock over exchange rates, started sharing ideas for creatively managing their budgets to stimulate short-term demand, rather than long-term growth.
For the past couple of years, finance ministers and central bank heads have had the luxury of using the IMF meetings to congratulate themselves on rapid global growth, regardless of how much they actually contributed to it.
(Globalization and China were the biggest part of the story.)
This time needs to be different.
High Tensions In the Low Countries
Belgium and the Netherlands, two founding members of the European Union, are increasingly divided about what that project now means.
The EU’s Reform Treaty is now the focus of that dispute, but its roots go deeper.
At one point, according to press reports, the row became so serious that French President Nicolas Sarkozy had to intervene.
Europe cannot afford a dogfight between these two founding member states, so it’s high time to put emotions aside and review their differences on the future course of European integration.
As a former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and Benelux Coordinator, I believe that the Netherlands and Belgium can once again play complementary roles.
From the very beginning, these countries have represented the different aspects of Europe’s identity: Belgium, as an industrial country, continentally oriented, bilingual, and an intermediary with southern Europe, and the Netherlands with its strong agricultural and trading tradition and its Anglo-Saxon and Atlantic orientation.
Of the two, Belgium tends to be more uncritically supportive of the EU.
Polls show that more than 80% of Belgians want yet more integration, whereas roughly 50% of the Dutch describing themselves as Euroskeptics.
They value the Union for its economic benefits, but are wary of its politics.
Belgian-Dutch cooperation has in years past been essential in helping Europe to move forward.
The Benelux Economic Union treaty of 1944 was an early testing ground for the Europe of the Six, and it was the joint Benelux Memorandum, fathered by the far-sighted J. W. Beyen and presented in Messina in 1955, that gave the impetus to the creation of the common market.
Indeed, it was the basis on which Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak and his colleagues worked when setting the scene for the Treaty of Rome and the European Economic Community.
The Spaak committee devised a system that balanced the voting power of states of varying size.
Clearly, a system of one vote per member state would have meant domination by Europe’s smaller states.
Conversely, a system based on population would have gone too far in favoring the big ones.
Balance was achieved partly by a system of weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, where most decisions are taken.
With each enlargement of the Union, this system of decision-making has been largely maintained.
The equilibrium in voting rights between small and large member states was also secured by vesting exclusive authority to propose regulation in the Commission, which expresses the common interests of the Community.
This authority was reinforced by requiring unanimity among member states to overrule the Commission – a provision that has strengthened the smaller states against the larger ones.
As open economies, Belgium and the Netherlands have both been interested in developing the internal market, while differing in their methods. Belgium followed the mainly French monetarist school, while the Netherlands shared Germany’s preference for economic convergence before committing to exchange-rate parity.
In 1991, when the Netherlands held the European presidency, Belgium supported its far-reaching draft for a treaty of European Union.
The Dutch proposed bringing all European decision-making − economic, foreign policy, justice, and home affairs − into a single framework.
The proposal turned out to be a step too far and subsequently went down in Dutch history as “black Monday,” named after the day on which the then foreign minister, Hans Van den Broek, faced near-unanimous opposition in the European Council of Ministers.
Belgium, though, was the one member state that supported the Dutch in this brave venture.
But the Belgians and Dutch have also been less than cooperative at times.
When it came to voting rights in the European Parliament and in the Council, the Dutch fought doggedly to get one extra vote in Amsterdam in 1991 and another in Nice in 2000.
This may have satisfied nationalist feelings in the Netherlands, as the country is 1.5 times the size of Belgium, but it did not go down well in Belgium.
The two countries also found themselves in opposing camps over the war in Iraq, and, of course, in their attitudes about further political integration.
The Netherlands’ current reserved stance on further political integration is not in its broader interest.
But Belgium could have shown greater understanding for the Netherlands’ position after Dutch voters decisively rejected the proposed European constitution in the mid-2005 referendum.
Belgium and the Netherlands need to resuscitate their cooperative efforts within the Benelux framework. The Benelux economy is the EU’s fourth largest.
Belgium will be serving on the United Nations Security Council for the next two years, and has indicated that it wants to give its mandate a European dimension. The coming period could thus be used in both countries to review traditional positions and reflect on how European policy can best serve their common needs.
Traditionally, the Netherlands has thought of itself as the smallest of the EU’s large member states. But others generally see it as the largest of the small.
Accepting this view could have a healthy impact on its behavior in the EU.
After all, the three largest EU states – Germany, Britain, and France – can be expected to seek agreements among themselves about the Union’s future shape, so the Benelux countries’ common goal should be to influence their actions and ensure that their thinking is acceptable to the whole community.
Three Encounters with Hillary
PARIS – It is Boston, July 2004.
The setting is a downtown restaurant to which the editor Tina Brown has invited Hillary Clinton and a handful of notables, including Caroline Kennedy, filmmaker Michael Moore, and former Senator George McGovern.
What is immediately striking is Clinton’s youthful appearance, bright laugh, and blue eyes that appear a little too round when she gazes at us with curiosity.
Sometimes her expression is briefly clouded by a streak of stifled pain, obstinate and not wholly contained.
Five years earlier, she was the most humiliated wife in America, a woman whose private life was thrown open – fully and relentlessly – to public scrutiny.
So she can talk national and international politics until she is blue in the face.
She can sing the praises of John Kerry, whom her party has just nominated in an effort to deny George W. Bush a second term.
And she can expound on her role as the junior senator from New York.
Still, there persists an idea that I cannot push out of my head, and that I enter into the travel journal that I am writing for The Atlantic.
The idea is this: to avenge her husband and to take revenge on him, to wash away the stain on the family and show what an unblemished Clinton administration might look like, this woman will sooner or later be a candidate for the presidency of the United States.
This idea brings to mind Philip Roth’s The Human Stain, published a year after the Senate acquitted her husband of perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges, with its searing portrait of how indelible even an undeserved blot on one’s reputation can be.
She will strive to enter the Oval Office – the theater of her inner, outer, and planetary misery – on her own terms.
And the most likely outcome, my article will conclude, is that she will succeed.
Fast forward to Paris in May 2011.
The senator from New York has become President Barack Obama’s secretary of state.
Her aura dominated the just-concluded G-8 summit hosted by France.
It is ten in the evening, and I am waiting at the elevators in the lobby of the Hotel Westin with Mahmoud Jibril, one of the leaders of the Libyan insurrection.
Jibril has made a special trip to plead on behalf of the civilians whom Colonel Muammar Qaddafi and his sons have promised to drown in rivers of blood.
“I thought you were in Libya!” she exclaims when she sees me.
“I’ve just returned,” I respond, gesturing toward Jibril.
“Really, hidden in a vegetable truck with him?”
That triggers one of those great bursts of laughter that, as I noticed in Boston, raise her high cheekbones still higher.
Then, suddenly serious, and accompanied by a man whom I notice for the first time and who turns out to be J. Christopher Stevens, the young US ambassador to Libya who will be murdered a little more than a year later, she leads Jibril to her suite for an interview.
When, after nearly an hour, Jibril reemerges, he is convinced that the conversation went badly.
He grumbles that Clinton hardly opened her mouth, which he interprets to mean that his plea was not well received.
In fact, Clinton was deeply moved by Jibril’s testimony, riveted by the horror of the regime’s tanks grinding toward Benghazi at that very moment.
In the hours that follow, she convinces Obama not to bow to his anti-interventionist secretary of defense, Robert Gates.
She displays emotion and composure, I note.
Her humanity and compassion are coupled with an acute sense of the iron discipline required for effective governance.
These are the reflexes of an impeccable stateswoman.
By February 2012, the war in Libya is over, and I am wrapping up my documentary film about the conflict.
I am in Washington, DC, in a wood-paneled conference room on the seventh floor of the Department of State’s headquarters, to gather Clinton’s recollections, as I had already done with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron.
This is the moment for conclusions and perspective, the always-fascinating moment when the actors in the drama, who have sometimes operated in secret, turn up their last cards.
Clinton lends herself graciously to the exercise.
She evokes her interview with Jibril, a conversation at the White House or the Elysée Palace.
She remembers everything and regrets nothing.
She feels that, in acting as she did, she was faithful to her most cherished values and beliefs.
And she has no doubt that the West, in responding to the Arab League’s entreaty to intervene, avoided a replay of Srebrenica in North Africa.
What strikes me the most is that she sees, even then, the beginnings of the tribal conflicts and the coming contest among Islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity.
She worries about the early violations of human rights, particularly women’s rights, which she fears will multiply.
She has no illusions that history turns out the way reason tells you it should.
Time is needed, she says, to build a state and construct a democracy – time and a mixture of pragmatism and faith, of patience and audacity, of respect for others and regard for oneself.
Was this concern about “nation building” a warning?
Was it her ideological contribution to an administration that, though she did not know it at the time, would continue without her?
Was she laying down the broad strokes and ambition of her own presidency?
One thing is certain: Of my three encounters with Hillary Clinton, this third was the one where I found her the strongest and most passionate, thoroughly imbued with the meaning and pitch of the great American pastoral.
If we meet again, I will not be surprised if I am addressing her as Madam President.
Hillary Clinton’s Asian Adventure
NEW DELHI – On her recent trip to China, Bangladesh, and India, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was eager to trumpet America’s “New Silk Road” strategy, which she unveiled last September.
But the Silk Road was a trade route, whereas knife-edge diplomacy dominated Clinton’s Asian tour.
Nothing about Clinton’s trip was as path-breaking as her visit earlier this spring to Myanmar, where she met with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Thein Sein to lend her support to their delicate political dance, which may yet bring the country into the global democratic fold.
Her trip opened with the always-tense annual US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which was threatened at the start by the plight of the blind human-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who had taken refuge in the United States’ embassy in Beijing.
But Chen was not the only one to upstage Clinton; her boss, President Barack Obama, did so as well, landing at midnight in Kabul, where he executed a strategic pact with Afghanistan, flying back to the US before dawn.
Was this – a negotiation without her participation – the defining event of Clinton’s Asian fortnight?
Afghanistan’s national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, describes the pact as “providing a strong foundation for the security of Afghanistan, (and) a document for the development of the region.”
But, while the new pact does clarify America’s post-2014 posture toward Afghanistan, and to some extent has assuaged India’s concerns about that troubled land’s future, anxiety in Pakistan has only deepened.
Only time will tell whether the pact boosts stability in the region.
Twice upstaged, Clinton’s discussions with China’s leaders took place under the shadow not only of the Chen affair, but also of the recent purge of Bo Xilai from the Communist Party’s senior leadership.
Bo’s ouster, the source of the greatest intra-Party ruckus since the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989, is the sort of dirty linen that China’s leaders never air in public.
So, instead, they “ripped into” the US delegation, in the words of a senior American official, over the Chen affair.
At first, with Chen in the US embassy, the Chinese began to suggest canceling the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, scheduled to begin with the arrival of Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
The Americans also appeared willing to walk away.
In the end, both sides blinked: the Americans accepted a deal for Chen to leave the embassy that could not be enforced, and the Chinese ultimately agreed to allow Chen to go to the US to study, just like many thousands of other Chinese do nowadays.
The China leg of Clinton’s Asia tour was salvaged – so much so that, at the end of her stay in Beijing, she indulged in the type of diplomatic hyperbole that few would have expected three days earlier: “Our countries are thoroughly, inescapably interdependent,” she said, adding that “a thriving China is good for America…” That may or may not be true; but both countries seem to have reached the conclusion that no human-rights dispute is worth sabotaging the entire bilateral relationship.
So it was on to Bangladesh for Clinton.
But here the American propensity for gratuitous preaching led to unnecessary strain in her talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government.
This time, the issue was Hasina’s treatment of the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the microcredit pioneer and founder of the Grameen Bank.
Unlike the testy Chinese, Hasina’s spokesperson offered only a gentle rejoinder, rejecting Clinton’s suggestions about alleged mistreatment of Yunus.
From Dhaka, Clinton made the short journey to India’s West Bengal, where her host was the diminutive Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose election ended 34 years of Communist rule in the state.
Assurances of US investment in Bengal’s development flowed; whether funds will actually follow remains to be seen.
Then it was on to India’s capital, New Delhi, for what many took to be Clinton’s farewell visit (assuming, that is, that she steps down at the end of this year as planned) – a visit marred by awkward coincidences and untidy scheduling.
Even as Clinton was cautioning Indian officials about contacts with Iran (demanding, in particular, a reduction in imports of Iranian oil), India was hosting a high-level Iranian trade mission aimed at boosting bilateral economic ties.
Finally, Clinton, speaking from Delhi, warned Pakistan not to allow its territory to be used as a “launching pad” by terrorist groups, asserting that al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was hiding in the country.
True to form, Pakistani officials were outraged at the charge, which they promptly refuted with roughly the same vehemence with which they once denied Osama Bin Laden’s presence.
The US responded by announcing that its drone attacks on Pakistan’s North Waziristan region will continue.
Was this the long-awaited signal that the US was about to squeeze Pakistan on the issue of terrorism?
With the US blueprint for its withdrawal from Afghanistan completed by Obama earlier on Clinton’s journey, one might think so.
In any case, Clinton’s tour appears to confirm the central fact of US diplomacy nowadays: the Asia pivot is complete.
The region is now America’s top foreign-policy priority.
The Agony of Hillary Clinton
WASHINGTON, DC – Being Hillary Clinton, one of the most celebrated women in the world, holder of some of the highest offices in American politics, and possibly the next president of the United States, has had more than its share of agony.
Widely regarded a year ago as a shoo-in for the Democratic Party’s nomination, she has faced a far more difficult slog than anyone, including her, ever contemplated.
Yet most of the problems Clinton is encountering were predictable and foreshadowed in 2008, when she ran against Barack Obama.
Others she has brought on herself.
For one thing, she’s simply not a very good politician.
Clinton is the only person known to have launched her campaign twice.
(The first attempt, in Iowa, where she talked to about eight people in closed meetings, didn’t work out very well.)
This impressive, remarkably intelligent woman just doesn’t have the feel for politics that is demanded at the highest levels.
Success in US presidential politics requires superb intuition, being quick on one’s feet, and, above all, a compelling rationale for running.
True, Clinton offers numerous programs that she would push as president; but, to borrow from Winston Churchill, there is no theme to her pudding.
The closest she comes to a message is a less-than-soaring “I’m a progressive who can get things done.”
By contrast, her rival, Bernie Sanders, has become a serious contender because he brilliantly composed a persuasive message for his campaign: The system is rigged and a corrupt campaign-finance regime is holding it in place.
The sweeping programs Sanders is pushing – a single-payer health-care system and free tuition at public colleges – however impracticable, are popular, especially among younger people, who overwhelmingly favor him over Clinton.
Her message is one of incrementalism: Don’t dare to dream big.
Meanwhile, Sanders is preaching a political revolution.
Then there’s the issue of trustworthiness.
Sanders’s integrity comes across as unimpeachable, while Clinton continues to provide reasons for questioning hers.
She and her advisers are clearly stunned by the force of the challenge she’s facing.
Sanders appears authentic; Clinton seems programmed.
She sometimes seems to be tone-deaf, particularly out of tune with the public mood on the subject of money.
Anger at the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else has been brewing for years.
Shortly before she began her campaign, Hillary Clinton said that when they left the White House she and her husband were “dead broke.”
If so, they recovered quickly: Bill and Hillary Clinton are believed to be worth well over $100 million, all of it made since they left the White House and most of it through astronomical speaking fees.
Not unlike other former US presidents – Jimmy Carter is a notable exception – the Clintons exploited their fame and influence to build up a fortune.
It’s not so much how they made most of their money as who paid them.
While Bill made business deals with some shady international figures, Hillary made a lot of her fortune by giving speeches to Wall Street firms, the main target of public wrath for causing the Great Recession of 2008.
This provided an ideal target for Sanders, who singled out the fact that Clinton earned $675,000 for three speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs.
Sanders’s charges put her back on her heels; when asked by the moderator in a CNN Town Hall why she accepted so much money from Goldman Sachs, a nonplussed Clinton shrugged and replied, “That’s what they offered.”
Then there’s the controversy over her having chosen to use a private, unsecured server installed at her home in Chappaqua, New York to process her emails, business as well as personal, when she was Secretary of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office.
The server issue, first revealed in March 2015, now dogs her campaign, speaking not only to her tone-deafness, but, more deadly, to her judgment.
How could she not know that a Secretary of State will receive and may respond to classified information?
After the server became public knowledge, Clinton, as her husband has also done, resorted to legalisms: She hadn’t received or sent information on her server that was “marked classified at the time.”
Students of Hillary-speak immediately sensed something fishy.
The State Department, it turns out, has two email systems: one classified and one unclassified; and one kind of material can’t be sent on the other.
To avoid sending her classified information on her private server, her aides delivered it by other means – orally or in written summaries.
Thus, they weren’t “marked classified at the time.”
Yet State Department inspectors have found hundreds of emails that had been sent to her server that should have been classified.
An FBI investigation is underway.
Finally, what was supposed to be a huge asset for her candidacy – the prospect of making history as the first woman president – isn’t working out as she and her campaign had expected.
As in 2008, large numbers of women don’t want to be told that they must support Clinton simply because she’s a woman.
They find that an insult to their intelligence, and young women in particular are largely supporting Sanders; they prefer his platform and are troubled by questions about her integrity.
The only group of women that Clinton carried in New Hampshire, where Sanders beat her by 22 percentage points, was those over 65.
In the latest caucus, in Nevada, Clinton’s presumed advantage among non-white voters, who are a far greater factor in Nevada than in Iowa or New Hampshire, seems to have served her well, with Sanders failing to win enough African-American voters, in particular, to defeat her.
This augurs well for future nominating contests.
But the general election could be something else.
Hillary in Asia, Round Two
SINGAPORE – US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to travel to Asia again in July to meet foreign ministers at the ASEAN Regional Forum, and to visit India.
On her first Asian trip in February, she provided a welcome contrast to the past with her openness to others’ views, her willingness to cooperate, and her star power.
She made Asians look at America anew.
But this trip will be trickier.
One challenge is that part of the plot for the US and Clinton is being written by others.
North Korea will be on the agenda after its missile tests, as will Myanmar, since its generals persist in prosecuting Aung San Suu Kyi, the world’s most famous political detainee, on trivial charges.
After all that has happened in recent weeks, the definition of “success” must be set low.
Nothing positive will come from the US condemning these two difficult regimes unilaterally.
So a key goal of Clinton’s visit must be to pull together with the Asian leaders present at the ASEAN Regional Forum.
As for Myanmar, its neighbors and fellow ASEAN members – Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand – are also concerned about Suu Kyi’s continued prosecution.
The US should begin to work with these countries not only on this matter, but also on the elections that Myanmar military junta has promised for 2010.
Together, they should press for assurances of a free and fair process, with the aim of avoiding the kind of mess that followed the Iranian elections.
Indonesia can be one ally.
After decades of autocracy, this vast archipelago of a country just concluded a presidential election that has solidified its transition to democracy.
India, proud of its long-standing democracy and fresh from its own elections, shares a border with Myanmar and can also assist efforts there.
The approach to North Korea is similar.
Kim Jong-il is a naughty boy who wants attention and incentives to behave decently.
Rather than debate with her counterparts, Clinton needs to ensure that other countries in the six-party framework, especially China and South Korea, are on the same page as the US.
On both issues, there is little capacity to exert force or sufficient pressure for solutions any time soon.
So diplomatic efforts must instead aim to join Americans and like-minded Asians in common cause, to push for steps forward in the medium to longer term.
Others must be brought on board, especially the Regional Forum hosts, ASEAN and Thailand.
A moral community should form in Asia, one that displaces its leaders’ usual cynical calculations of power in order to jump on the right bandwagon.
In all this, China is the 800-pound dragon in the room.
China is already closer to ASEAN and a key player with respect to Myanmar, North Korea, and other sticky issues.
A “bamboo” economic zone appears to be emerging, perhaps to replace today’s weakening US-centric trans-Pacific ties.
This is the context for Clinton’s visit to India, as well.
George W. Bush’s administration should be credited for giving overdue recognition to India, but this was done primarily on a bilateral basis.
The US should now leverage that relationship to work on regional and even global issues.
Besides her own work, Clinton is likely to also be inundated during this visit with requests concerning President Barack Obama.
There is still no confirmation concerning when Obama will visit Asia, though many expect that he will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, to be held in Singapore in November.
China, Japan, and Indonesia must be among Obama’s priorities, but many others will clamor for him to visit their capitals.
Clinton and the US administration would do well to decide which requests are merely photo ops and confine these to meetings at the sidelines of APEC.
The US should insist on a substantive agenda as a precondition for any Obama visit.
In China, for example, Clinton successfully established an agenda for the two countries to work together on climate change.
Plans and resources now must be prepared.
Clinton has reopened the doors for Obama in Asia with charm and confidence.
Obama will eventually come to Asia with many high expectations and star billing.
While his charisma and openness to dialog will be sought after, substance will also be measured and much needed.
By November, after all, it will be more than a year since the global crisis began in the US, and Obama and his team must show tangible prospects for recovery.
American leadership – globally and in Asia – can no longer be presumed. It must be earned.
A Tale of Two Atomic Cities
HIROSHIMA/NAGASAKI – On April 27, representatives of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’s 190 member countries will meet in New York for a four-week review of the 45-year-old pact.
The attendees would be wise to consider an important fact: Although the NPT requires its members to “pursue negotiations in good faith” on nuclear disarmament, a wide legal gap still remains when it comes to eliminating nuclear weapons.
It is time for the NPT’s signatories to initiate disarmament negotiations.
This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on August 6 and 9, when citizens everywhere will have an opportunity to pay their respects to the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed or wounded on those tragic days.
This is also an occasion to honor the survivors, by supporting their call to eliminate all nuclear weapons, thereby ensuring that no one will ever suffer as they have.
We, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are but two voices among representatives from more than 6,600 cities in 160 countries and regions worldwide who support this historic goal.
Our organization, Mayors for Peace, was created in 1982 as a way to transcend national borders and work together toward the abolition of nuclear weapons.
More mayors are joining our cause every year, and our determination to pursue nuclear disarmament will only deepen in the years ahead.
It is fitting that mayors, driven by their sense of responsibility to protect their citizens’ safety and welfare, take a keen interest in this cause.
The horrific, indiscriminate, and long-term consequences of nuclear weapons for humanity and the environment cannot be overstated – especially when they target densely populated areas.
The danger that nuclear weapons will be used again, either intentionally or accidentally, will exist for as long as they remain available, a conclusion reached at three major international humanitarian conferences and strongly affirmed by the United Nations.
And it is scandalous that vast sums are being devoted to maintaining and modernizing these weapons at a time when budget constraints undermine efforts to address pressing human needs around the world.
The number of nuclear near-misses – accidents and miscalculations that have almost led to disaster – is shocking.
Moreover, such weapons and their related facilities and components are attractive targets for terrorists.
It is a matter of no small public concern that international security still depends on “nuclear deterrence” – a doctrine based on mutual distrust that aims to keep the peace through the threat of mass killings.
Worse, there have been suggestions of their actual use.
Military planners who consider the use of nuclear weapons have probably given scant thought to those living in the cities on their target lists.
For too long, the residents of cities have been used as pawns on a global nuclear chessboard, with little concern for the full implications of playing the game.
But, as the public is educated about the specific threats that nuclear weapons continue to pose to the cities in which they live, that stance will be increasingly difficult to maintain.
At the same time, people worldwide must stop regarding one another as untrustworthy enemies.
That is why Mayors for Peace, together with a wide range of civil-society groups, is striving not only for the abolition of nuclear weapons, but also to cultivate a shared sense of belonging to a single human family, regardless of our cultural, religious, or ethnic differences.
Until now, nuclear-weapon states’ national governments and bureaucracies have preferred to limit the disarmament debate to symbolic measures that imply no deadlines or additional legally binding obligations.
They claim that the security environment is not mature enough to take bold steps toward nuclear disarmament.
We disagree.
Concerted efforts – involving national and local governments, universities, workers’ unions, political parties, environmental groups, young people, women’s groups, lawyers, and the business community – can change the world.
But it is world leaders – in particular, those whose countries maintain nuclear weapons – who must take the first step toward building confidence and initiating meaningful cooperation on disarmament.
Along the way, they can lay the groundwork for a new kind of security system – one that does not rely on nuclear deterrence.
It is crucial that representatives at the NPT review conference work together to bring the rule of law to nuclear disarmament and close the gap in the NPT that has permitted the most inhumane of all weapons of mass destruction to continue to exist.
Mayors for Peace and its civil-society partners will do everything we can do to support them.
The tragic tale of our two cities should never become the tale of your city.
Historical Memory and Engineering Failures
George Santayana, the Spanish-American poet and philosopher, once warned that "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
This is especially true in the field of bridge building, where over the past 150 years dramatic failures have occurred at surprisingly regular intervals.
In 1847, the first major structural failure on Britain's expanding railway network occurred at Chester, England.
The Dee Bridge, whose cast- and wrought-iron design followed common practice for the period, collapsed under a passing train, killing everyone aboard.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the structure, the longest of its kind, simply pushed the limits of railroad-bridge engineering too far.
In 1879, the longest bridge in the world spanned the River Tay at Dundee, Scotland.
Composed of many modest spans, the structure involved no radically new design concepts and seemed to be a mere application of proven technology.
However, the force of the wind was grossly underestimated and worksmanship was inferior.
As a result, the Tay Bridge, vulnerable in a gale, was blown off its supports.
In 1907, the longest span in the world was being constructed over the St. Lawrence River near Quebec, Canada.
The bridge was of a relatively new type, known as a cantilever, which had become quite fashionable.
Although it was only slightly longer than the highly successful cantilever bridge over the Forth River near Edinburgh, Scotland, the Quebec Bridge was so inadequately designed that it collapsed before it was completed.
In 1940, the third longest suspension bridge in the world was opened in Washington State.
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was designed as state of the art, which included a strong aesthetic preference for slender structures.
Within four months of its opening, the bridge was destroyed by winds in a manner totally unanticipated by its engineers.
In 1970, steel box-girder bridges in Milford Haven, Wales, and in Melbourne, Australia, failed spontaneously while under construction.
Both were among the longest structures of their kind and were thought to be just natural applications of existing technology. 
In 2000, the much-anticipated opening of London's Millennium Bridge over the River Thames was followed only three days later by its closure.
The sleek footbridge swayed unexpectedly and excessively under the feet of pedestrians, and it was deemed too dangerous to use.
What should have been a mere extension of the millennia-old art of building pedestrian bridges, proved to be a modern engineering embarrassment.
The thirty-year interval between historic bridge failures was first highlighted by the work of Paul Sibly, who wrote a thesis on the subject, and his University of London advisor, A. C. Walker.
They noted the cyclical regularity of such occurrences and speculated that it represented a gap in communications between generations of engineers. 
Although each of the notable failures involved a different type of bridge, in no case was the structure radically new.
Each used technology that engineers had been confidently employing for bridges, and for which the assumed loads and methods of analysis were well established.
In every case, engineers believed that they were just building incrementally on successful practice.
In fact, designing in a climate of success can be dangerous for an engineer.
Successful experience teaches us only that what has been accomplished in the past has worked. But things that work on a small scale do not necessarily work when slightly larger.
This was known to Vitruvius, who wrote about Greek and Roman engineering more than 2,000 years ago.
It was also known to Galileo, who noted that Renaissance engineers who followed successful methods of building ships and moving obelisks were often surprised by the spontaneous failures when tried with larger ships and obelisks.
Failures always reveal weaknesses and provide incontrovertible evidence of our incomplete understanding of how things work.
When the failures described above occurred, engineers were sensitized to their own limitations and so approached subsequent designs - no matter of what kind of bridge - with renewed respect for the laws and forces of nature.
Unfortunately, human memory fades with time, and new generations of engineers with no vivid experience of past failures can proceed with hubris to design again beyond wise limits.
The history of engineering is no mere adjunct to technical know-how.
A historical perspective on bridge building or any other engineering specialty provides a caveat about how our humanity affects our thinking.
Building a new bridge following a familiar model can lead to complacency. Building a novel bridge, especially in the wake of a spectacular failure, forces engineers to think from scratch and also to think more deeply and critically.
Hence, the paradox that success leads to failure, and failure leads to success.
The cable-stayed bridge is a form that is currently being pushed to limits and beyond those originally imagined to apply to it.
Widespread successes with cable-stayed structures have made the type almost commonplace.
As such, its development into ever longer spans is following the historic pattern that in the past has led to failures.
Whether there will be a major cable-stayed bridge failure soon - or around the year 2030 - will most likely depend not so much on computer analyses as on how well engineers know their history and are determined not to repeat it.
Historic Election in Egypt?
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders, including the incumbent of 24 years, Hosni Mubarak.
While few doubt the outcome will be his re-election, many are intensely following the process.
Some 6000 domestic election monitors have been training for the event, while hundreds of foreign reporters are converging on the country this week.
Although all the formal trappings of a true electoral contest are in place, important aspects of authenticity are glaringly absent.
Despite promises to the contrary, this is far from a level playing field.
Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets: name recognition, a virtual monopoly on state-controlled electronic media and some 85% of the print media.
One week before the poll, some opposition candidates have yet to air even one campaign ad on Egyptian television.
All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees, and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers.
Since the year 2000, Egypt’s 8000 judges must supervise and certify election results, by ruling of the High Court.
This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges’ professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs.
So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge’s union.
One was to stretch the definition of ‘the judiciary’ to include thousands of loyal government employees who have law degrees but no experience on the bench.  This boxes in the true judges, for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties, the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior.
Thus, in the past, the judges’ union tended to go along, with predictable results.
In the 2000 parliamentary elections, while Mubarak’s ruling party received roughly 38% of the popular vote in districts supervised by true judges, that percent somehow jumped to 86% where the quasi-judges were in charge.
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence, and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) races.
On September 2nd they made their final demands: allow civil society groups to observe the voting process, stop interfering in the definition of legitimate judges for purposes of the election, and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted, certified and reported.
Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.  
Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate over whether to vote or to boycott the presidential race.
Several opposition parties have called on their members to stay away in protest over restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.’
This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak, the sole ruler for 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.
These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote, then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem.
The regime response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of the judges.
That argument was quickly undermined when the judges’ union announced their support for civil society monitors.
Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the mounting challenges from within and without to hold a free and fair election, or is simply incapable of ridding the party of cheating as a way of life, the present signs do not bode well for next Wednesday’s polls.
Meanwhile, Egyptians for the first time are experiencing the thrilling taste of defying tyranny, and enjoying some newly-found space for freedom.     
The Use and Abuse of Monetary History
BERKELEY – Imagine two central banks.
One is hyperactive, responding aggressively to events.
While it certainly cannot be accused of ignoring current developments, its policies are widely criticized as storing up problems for the future.
The other central bank is unflappable.
It remains calm in the face of events, seeking at all cost to avoid doing anything that might be construed as encouraging excessive risk-taking or creating even a whiff of inflation.
What I have just described is no mere hypothetical, of course.
It is, in fact, a capsule depiction of the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
One popular explanation for the two banks’ different approaches is that they stem from their societies’ respective historical experiences.
The banks’ institutional personalities reflect the role of collective memory in shaping how officials conceptualize the problems that they face.
The Great Depression of the 1930’s, when the Fed stood idly by as the economy collapsed, is the molding event seared into the consciousness of every American central banker.
As a result, the Fed responds aggressively when it perceives even a limited risk of another depression.
By contrast, the defining event shaping European monetary policy is the hyperinflation of the 1920’s, filtered through the experience of the 1970’s and 1980’s, when central banks were enlisted once again to finance budget deficits – and again with inflationary consequences.
Indeed, delegating national monetary policies to a Europe-wide central bank was intended to solve precisely this problem.
It is not only in central banking, of course, that we see the role of historical experience in shaping policymaking.
President Lyndon Johnson, when deciding to escalate US intervention in Vietnam, drew an analogy with Munich, when the failure to respond to Hitler’s aggression had catastrophic consequences.
A quarter-century later, President George H.W. Bush, considering how best to roll back Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, drew an analogy with Vietnam, where the absence of an exit strategy had caused US forces to get bogged down.
But a key conclusion of research on foreign policy is that decision-makers all too often fail to test their analogies for “fitness.”
They fail to ask whether there is, in fact, a close correspondence between historical circumstances and current facts.
They invoke specific analogies not so much because they resemble current conditions, but because they are seared into the public’s consciousness.
As a result, analogical reasoning both shapes and distorts policy.
It misleads decision-makers, as it did both Johnson and Bush.
The same dangers arise for monetary policy.
For the Fed, it is important to ask whether the 1930’s, when its premature policy tightening precipitated a double-dip recession, really is the best historical analogy to consider when contemplating how to time the exit from its current accommodating stance.
Certainly, the Great Depression is not the only alternative on offer.
The Fed might also consider policy in 1924-1927, when low interest rates fueled stock-market and real-estate bubbles, or 2003-2005, when interest rates were held down in the face of serious financial imbalances.
At a minimum, the Fed might develop a “portfolio” of analogies, test them for fitness, and distill their lessons, as President John F. Kennedy famously did when weighing his options during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
Similarly, the ECB might consider not only how monetary accommodation allowed governments to run large budget deficits in the 1920’s, but also how central bankers’ failure to respond to the financial crisis of the 1930’s fed political extremism and undermined support for responsible government.
Again, rigorous analysis requires testing these historical analogies for fitness with current circumstances.
Anyone who does so will find it hard to defend the ECB and its stubborn inaction in the face of events.
There is exactly zero evidence in Europe today that inflation is just around the corner.
And, if current European governments are not committed to austerity and fiscal consolidation, then which governments are?
When I consider the European economy, the ECB’s failure to provide more monetary support for economic growth appears to be directly analogous to Europe’s disastrous monetary policies in the 1930’s.
The political consequences could be similarly devastating.
Europeans should ponder why the inflationary 1920’s, rather than the politically catastrophic 1930’s, have become the historical lodestar for current monetary policy.
On the other hand, when I contemplate the US economy, I conclude that recovery from the Great Depression, and not 1924-1927 or 2003-2005, is the episode that most closely resembles current circumstances.
Only in the 1930’s were interest rates near zero.
Only in the 1930’s was the economy digging itself out from a major financial crisis.
Then again, perhaps it is to be expected that I find the analogy with the 1930’s compelling.
That was the defining episode for American monetary policy.
And I am, after all, an American.
A Brief History of (In)equality
BERKELEY – The Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen recently gave a talk in Lisbon about inequality that demonstrated one of the virtues of being a scholar of economic history.
Eichengreen, like me, glories in the complexities of every situation, avoiding oversimplification in the pursuit of conceptual clarity.
This disposition stays the impulse to try to explain more about the world than we can possibly know with one simple model.
For his part, with respect to inequality, Eichengreen has identified six first-order processes at work over the past 250 years.
The first is the widening of Britain’s income distribution between 1750 and 1850, as the gains from the British Industrial Revolution went to the urban and rural middle class, but not to the urban and rural poor.
Second, between 1750 and 1975, income distribution also widened globally, as some parts of the world realized gains from industrial and post-industrial technologies, while others did not.
For example, in 1800, American purchasing power parity was twice that of China; by 1975 it was 30 times that of China.
The third process is what is known as the First Age of Globalization, between 1850 and 1914, when living standards and labor productivity levels converged in the global north.
During this time, 50 million people left an overcrowded agricultural Europe for resource-rich new settlements.
They brought their institutions, technologies, and capital with them, and the wage differential between Europe and these new economies shrank from roughly 100% to 25%.
This mostly coincided with the Gilded Age between 1870 and 1914, when domestic inequality rose in the global north as entrepreneurship, industrialization, and financial manipulation channeled new gains mostly to the wealthiest families.
Gilded Age inequality was significantly reversed during the period of social democracy in the global north, between 1930 and 1980, when higher taxes on the wealthy helped pay for new government benefits and programs.
But the subsequent and last stage brings us to the current moment, when economic policy choices have again resulted in a widening of the distribution of gains in the global north, ushering in a new Gilded Age.
Eichengreen’s six processes affecting inequality are a good starting point.
But I would go further and add six more.
First, there is the stubborn persistence of absolute poverty in some places, despite the extraordinary overall reduction since 1980.
As the UCLA scholar Ananya Roy points out, people in absolute poverty are deprived of both the opportunities and the means to change their status.
They lack what the philosopher Isaiah Berlin called “positive liberty” – empowerment for self-actualization – as well as “negative liberty,” or freedom from obstacles in one’s path of action.
Seen in this light, inequality is an uneven distribution not only of wealth, but also of liberty.
Second is the abolition of slavery in many parts of the world during the nineteenth century, followed by, third, the global loosening over time of other caste constraints – race, ethnicity, gender – which deprived even some people with wealth of the opportunities to use it.
The fourth process consists of two recent high-growth generations in China and one high-growth generation in India, which has been a significant factor underlying global wealth convergence since 1975.
Fifth is the dynamic of compound interest, which through favorable political arrangements allows the wealthy to profit from the economy without actually creating any new wealth.
As the French economist Thomas Piketty has observed, this process may have played some role in our past, and will surely play an even bigger role in our future.
At this point, it should be clear why I began by noting the complexity of economic history.
This complexity implies that any adjustments to our political economy should be based on sound social science and directed by elected leaders who are genuinely acting in the interest of the people.
Emphasizing complexity brings me to a final factor affecting inequality – perhaps the most important of all: populist mobilizations.
Democracies are prone to populist uprisings, especially when inequality is on the rise.
But the track record of such uprisings should give us pause.
In France, populist mobilizations installed an emperor – Napoleon III, who led a coup in 1851 – and overthrew democratically elected governments during the Second Republic.
In the United States, they underpinned discrimination against immigrants and sustained the Jim Crow era of legal racial segregation.
In Central Europe, populist mobilizations have driven imperial conquests under the banner of proletarian internationalism.
In the Soviet Union, they helped Vladimir Lenin consolidate power, with disastrous consequences that were surpassed only by the horrors of Nazism, which also came to power on a populist wave.
Constructive populist responses to inequality are fewer, but they should certainly be mentioned.
In some cases, populism has helped in extending the franchise; enacting a progressive income tax and social insurance; building physical and human capital; opening economies; prioritizing full employment; and encouraging migration.
History teaches us that these latter responses to inequality have made the world a better place.
Unfortunately – and at the risk of oversimplification – we usually fail to heed history’s lessons.
History’s Ghosts in Iran
Using historical analogies to interpret the present is both tempting and dangerous, for history never truly repeats itself.
Yet, to understand the difficulty of responding to the problems that Iran’s nuclear ambition and anti-Israel obsession now pose, it might be helpful to analyze the three analogies that are most commonly used.
Some compare the Iranian regime to Nazi Germany.
Others believe that the only useful analogy is to Europe’s old balance-of-power games.
And still others combine the two, pointing to the “balance of terror” during the Cold War.
In other words: is Iran to be treated as Hitler’s Germany in 1938, Prussia in 1756, or Stalin’s Soviet Union?
Each analogy contains an element of truth, but none, of course, corresponds to the realities of the challenges Iran represents.
Above all, each analogy, if taken seriously, should lead to a specific course of action, and this is far from being the case today.
Let us start with the analogy between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hitler.
Ahmedinejad pursues a dual objective with his anti-Zionist obsession: to de-legitimize Israel and to re-legitimize Iran’s claim to speak for Muslims over the heads of their more cautious governments.
He very probably means what he says about Jews and Israel, but is he a latter-day Hitler, and is today’s Iran the equivalent of Germany in the 1930’s?
Hitler came close to developing the nuclear bomb, but never had it, whereas Iran very well might.
But Hitler’s power over Germany was much more absolute than Ahmadinejad’s power over Iran.
The results of Iran’s recent municipal elections were humiliating for Ahmadinejad and his supporters.
Those elections would have been unthinkable in Nazi Germany.
Although the Iranian regime’s rhetoric may be totalitarian, political power there is much more diffused.
The analogy with Hitler’s Germany is also problematic because, if it were regarded as true, the only sensible course of action would be a preventive strike on Iran and the removal of Ahmadinejad.
Given the evolution of American strategic thinking after Iraq (and now Afghanistan), and of Israel’s strategic thinking after Lebanon, a preventive strike is highly unlikely.
The second analogy, to the old balance-of-power system in Europe, is especially popular among Israeli and American diplomats.
According to this view, if Iran wants to de-legitimize Israel and ultimately unite Moslems against the West, the only answer is to isolate Iran in the Middle East, and to create alliances against Iran with moderate Sunni Arab regimes.
Before the 1979 Iranian revolution, some in Israel advocated an alliance between Israel, Turkey, and Iran, the Middle East’s three non-Arab powers.
Today, many in the United States and Israel dream of a moderate Arab front, with countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt containing and isolating “radical” Iran.
That diplomatic project is far from absurd.
The rise of Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon as instruments of Iranian ambitions can only worry moderate Arab regimes.
But such an alliance has a price: the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, with serious territorial concessions on Israel’s part to match the Palestinians’ absolute recognition of Israel.
Moderate Arab regimes will not dare to engage in an open and serious process of rapprochement with Israel in the absence of real progress over the Palestinian issue.
But are the two parties ready for it?
Could the US, a wounded power mired in Iraq, implement the part of the Baker report that suggests “Peace in Baghdad goes through Jerusalem”?
While Israel’s non-victory in Lebanon and the Palestinians’ bloody divisions mean that both sides have been humbled, a breakthrough, though possible, remains unlikely.
The third analogy is reflected in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s recent references to Israel’s nuclear deterrent, which may have been a mistake, but probably indicate the evolution of Israeli strategic thinking.
Olmert seemed to be reminding the Iranians of the hard realities of nuclear deterrence: Iran may join the nuclear club someday, but it will return to the Stone Age if it uses those weapons against a country that has a far more advanced nuclear arsenal.
The comparison here is to the Cold War period.
But can today’s Iran be compared to the Soviet Union?
The success of the “balance of terror” presupposed a mixture of confrontation and dialogue between two “rational actors.”
Can Iran under Ahmadinejad be considered a rational actor?
The dilemma concerning Iran is whether a power imbued with an “absolute” ideology can be allowed to be in control of an “absolute” weapon.
Since a military solution is highly improbable, what are the serious alternatives? Can we have a productive dialogue with Iran while rejecting the mad ideology of its president?
As the shortcomings of the three most popular historical analogies suggest, the answer is far from obvious.
History, Used and Abused
LONDON – In her brilliant book, “The Uses and Abuses of History” the historian Margaret Macmillan tells a story about two Americans discussing the atrocities of September 11, 2001. One draws an analogy with Pearl Harbor, Japan’s attack on the US in 1941.
His friend has no idea as to what this means.  “You know,” the first man replies, “It was when the Vietnamese bombed the American fleet and started the Vietnam War.”
Historical memory is not always quite as bad as this.  But international politics and diplomacy are riddled with examples of bad and ill-considered precedents being used to justify foreign policy decisions, invariably leading to catastrophe.
Munich – the 1938 meeting between Adolf Hitler, Édouard Daladier, Neville Chamberlain, and Benito Mussolini – is a frequent witness summoned to court by politicians trying to argue the case for foreign adventures.
Britain’s disastrous 1956 invasion of Egypt was talked about as though Gamal Nasser was a throw-back to the fascist dictators of the 1930’s. If he were to be appeased as they had been, the results would be catastrophic in the Middle East.  
Munich was also produced as a justification for the Vietnam War and President Bush’s war of choice in Iraq.
1930’s appeasement – a word that elides diplomatic engagement and the rejection of military options – was said to remind us of what would happen if South Vietnam was not defended and Iraq not invaded.  We know what happened in both countries.
But analogies are not always wrong, and those that were wrong in the past could prove correct today.  One of the arguments for the Vietnam War was the so-called domino theory.  If South Vietnam was to fall to the Communists, other countries in South-East Asia would tumble before Communist insurgency.  
Things turned out very different.
Vietnam proved to be the end not the beginning of the line.
Pol Pot’s wicked regime murdered millions in Cambodia until Vietnam intervened.  
Elsewhere in the region capitalism, promoted by the opening of markets, triggered growth and promoted stability.
Globalisation produced its own domino effect.  The dominoes toppled; GDP rose; millions were lifted out of poverty; literacy rates soared; child mortality figures fell.
Maybe, if not there and if not then, dominoes are more relevant to foreign and security policy today.
In America and Europe at the moment, many people are calling for the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan. We are told that NATO and the West cannot build a nation there and that the goals that have been set for establishing democracy and prosperity are unattainable. 
NATO soldiers die in vain.
Sooner or later the Taliban will sweep to power again, at liberty as happened before to throw acid in women’s faces.
It is vanity to think that anything can be done to prevent this. Better to cut and run than stay and die, and who is to say that the result will embolden Taliban terrorists?
They do not necessarily share the same aims as Al Qaeda.    
There have certainly been mistakes in Afghanistan.
After the overthrow of the Taliban regime, the West did not commit enough troops to extend the national government in Kabul’s authority over the whole country.
The Bush administration had turned its attention to the preparations for the Iraq war. 
Development has been slow. The build-up of the Afghan army and police has lagged.  The poppy crop has grown.
Sometimes the military response to insurgency has been too tough; sometimes too light.
The West has courted trouble in appearing to isolate the Pashtun.
So the West can do better. There is no doubt about that.
But the case for quitting is bad and touches on Pakistan’s future as well as Afghanistan’s.
Leave Afghanistan to the Taliban, hoping against hope that they will become better-behaved global citizens, and what is the effect likely to be on Pakistan?
Here come the dominoes – wrong in Vietnam but not necessarily in the South Asian sub-continent.
Afghanistan is NATO’s great test.
The Alliance has promised to see the job through.  So if it abandons the job now, leaving the country to poverty, prejudice, and poppies, what then will happen? 
Why should anyone in Pakistan believe that the West is serious in wanting to sustain that country as a Muslim democratic state?
Would such a decision help turn the tide against the Taliban?
Would it encourage the middle-class professional and urban workers in Pakistan, disgusted by the excesses of the extremists, to dig in and see off fundamentalism?
Would it strengthen the more moderate elements in politics and the military?
You can count on us, the West would be saying, but don’t look next door to Afghanistan, where you will see that you can’t rely on us.
If Pakistan, nuclear weapons and all, was to fall to the extremists, the consequences in terms of encouraging the export of terrorism would be dire.
Think about Kashmir.  Think about India.
How would India’s government view the future if Pakistan falls into the hands of fundamentalists?
So the West should see the job through in Afghanistan – do it better but do it.  Sometimes the dominoes do topple over, one by one.
That is not a prospect that anyone should welcome in South Asia.
Holding Charities Accountable
Suppose you are concerned about children in Africa dying from preventable diseases.
You want to donate money to a charity that is working to reduce the toll.
But there are many charities doing that.
How do you choose?
The first thing that many people ask about charities is, “How much of my donation is spent on administration?”
In the United States, that figure is readily available from Charity Navigator, a Web site that has five million users.
But the information is taken from forms that the charities themselves complete and send to the tax authorities.
No one checks the forms, and the proportions allocated to administration and program expenses are easily massaged with a little creative accounting. 
Worse still, that figure, even if accurate, tells you nothing about the charity’s impact.
The pressure to keep administrative expenses low can make an organization less effective.
If, for example, an agency working to reduce poverty in Africa cuts staff with expert knowledge, it is more likely to end up funding projects that fail.
It may not even know which of its projects fail, because evaluating them, and learning from mistakes, requires staff – and that adds to administrative costs.
In 2006, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld faced the question of which charity would make the best use of their money.
They were in their mid-twenties, earning six-figure incomes at an investment company – more than they needed – and were thinking about donating money to help make the world a better place.
As investment advisers, they would never recommend investing in a company without detailed information about how well it was achieving its goals.
They wanted to make similarly well-informed choices about the charities to which they contributed.
So Karnofsky and Hassenfeld got together with six friends who also worked in finance and divided up the field to find out which charities could be shown to be effective.
They contacted organizations and received lots of attractive marketing material, but nothing that answered basic questions: what do the charities do with their money, and what evidence do they have that their activities help?
They called many charities, but eventually realized something that seemed extraordinary: the information was just not there. 
Some foundations said that information on their work’s effectiveness was confidential.
This, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld thought, is not a good way to go about charitable work.
Why should information about how to help people be secret?
The fact that charities were unprepared for such questions indicated to Karnofsky and Hassenfeld that other donors and foundations give more or less blindly, without the information needed to make sound decisions about whom to support. 
Karnofsky and Hassenfeld now had a new goal: to obtain and publicize the information.
To that end, they founded an organization called GiveWell so that other donors would not have as hard a time extracting it as they had had.
However, it soon became apparent that the task required more than part-time attention, and the following year, after raising $300,000 from their colleagues, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld left their jobs and began working full-time for GiveWell and its associated grant-making body, The Clear Fund.
They invited charities to apply for grants of $25,000 in five broad humanitarian categories, with the application process demanding the kind of information that they had been seeking.
In this way, a substantial part of the money they had raised would go to the most effective charity in each category, while simultaneously encouraging transparency and rigorous evaluation.
The first report on which organizations are most effective at saving or transforming lives in Africa is now available on GiveWell’s Web site, www.givewell.net .
Population Services International, which promotes and sells items like condoms, to prevent HIV infection, and bed nets, to prevent malaria, came out on top, followed by Partners in Health, an organization that provides health care to poor rural populations.
The third-ranked organization was Interplast, which is more narrowly focused on correcting deformities like cleft palate.
Evaluating charities can be more difficult than making investment decisions.
Investors are interested in financial returns, so there is no problem about measuring distinct values – in the end it all comes down to money.
It is more difficult to compare the reduction of suffering brought about by correcting a facial deformity with saving a life.
There is no single unit of value. 
In other ways, too, evaluating charities takes time, and can be expensive.
Perhaps for this reason, many organizations, including some of the best-known anti-poverty organizations working in Africa, did not respond to GiveWell’s request for information.
No doubt they calculated that a chance to get a $25,000 grant wasn’t worth it.
But if donors start to follow GiveWell’s recommendations, then a high ranking from GiveWell could be worth far more than the value of the grant.
This is why the potential of GiveWell is revolutionary.
In the US, individual donors give about $200 billion to charities each year.
No one knows how effective that vast sum is in achieving the goals that donors intend to support.
By giving charities an incentive to become more transparent and more focused on being demonstrably effective, GiveWell could make our charitable donations do much more good than ever before.
Holland After van Gogh
The murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh and the ensuing arson attacks against mosques, churches, and Islamic schools have caused more soul-searching in Dutch homes in the last week than in the past two decades.
The old Netherlands, it seems, has ceased to be, never to return.
The goal now must be to unite the Dutch people. This will require much work on the part of both immigrants and native Dutch.
As long as moderates keep their heads, a new Netherlands may be born out of the terrible events of the past weeks.
It is often said of the various immigrant groups in the Netherlands that they lack the ability to "cleanse themselves" through honest self-appraisal and criticism.
There are many who acknowledge this and want to change.
Non-committal multiculturalism has long kept the conservatism of Dutch Moroccans and Dutch Turks hidden from the public eye.
Among immigrants, soul-searching is closely related to belonging and commitment, which in practice boils down to feeling part of society and feeling responsible for the city, neighborhood, and street where you live.
We native Dutch also find it hard to hold a mirror to ourselves.
We are bad listeners and air our views whether or not we have thought deeply about them.
There is a lack of self-examination.
As a result, many people no longer understand themselves, which makes it hard for them to understand others.
Freedom of expression is becoming a caricature.
When asked what it was like to be interviewed by Theo van Gogh, European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said, "He was impertinent, and that is a good thing; he was offensive, and that is not."
It is as simple as that.
In today's Netherlands, assertiveness is seen as a good thing, modesty as a form of self-chastisement.
Respect is for wimps!
Moral relativism has damaged public life.
Many youngsters now see politics as a kind of computer game.
It is no longer about message or content - it is just one more form of entertainment, and what matters is who wins and who loses.
Context has been lost.
Extreme ideas offer an alternative compass to disoriented souls like Mohammed Bouyeri, van Gogh's suspected murderer.
He is not so much a product of zealous imams from rural Morocco as of the West's information society.
The gospel of Muslim extremism has found a global market through the Internet.
Something similar is happening on the extreme right, with "white power" offering an apparent certainty to youngsters who are adrift.
The real struggle is about ideas.
Indeed, what is most ominous is that extremists realize this more clearly than the moderate, silent majority, who find the noise irritating but do not know how to start a serious dialogue.
Meanwhile, tolerance degenerates into multicultural segregation.
We do not live together, but in isolation from each other.
The Turkish-Dutch headmaster of the Muslim school in Uden that was burned down after van Gogh's murder voiced the inhibitions we all feel when he asked, rhetorically, "Is the enemy not within us?"
A revived permissive society is not the answer.
The state must battle terrorism, public space must not be abandoned to extremists, and Islam in Europe must adapt to Europe.
People who live in a society they hate, amidst people they despise, cannot contribute to a shared future.
Life in Europe will only remain worth living if all cultures and religions accept the laws that represent the common interest.
So a European Islam is needed urgently.
It can be given shape by, for example, training imams in Europe, by encouraging mosques to promote social cohesion in their neighborhoods, and by more active participation by Muslims in the public debate.
At the same time, native Europeans must learn to accept that Islam may offer new vantage points on such moral issues as euthanasia, abortion, individuality, and solidarity.
This way Islam could really become a source of inspiration for the European community of values.
If we want to build something better on the ruins of multicultural indifference, our dialogue must become more profound.
Prejudice must make way for empathy, and alienation for respect.
Essentially, this is all about giving a new meaning to solidarity, beyond the left-right dichotomy.
It is time for a civilizing mission that will emerge from society itself and bring people together.
This mission must also reflect a new politics that does not accentuate differences, but helps shape a new sense of who "we" are.
The Netherlands need not be the focus of international religious conflict. What is precious must be preserved, and what enriches must be absorbed.
This process must begin in school.
Children must learn that they do not live in a monoculture, but in a pluralist society bound together by universal values and common laws.
They must learn that critical thought is valuable, and that doubt is healthy.
Restoring the past is not an option.
Rudderless societies are easy prey for bigotry.
This is not just a matter for politicians.
All of us must help turn Europe's motto "unity in diversity" into a genuine guiding principle.
François Hollande’s Tartuffe Syndrome
LONDON – In his classic comedy “Tartuffe, or The Impostor,” Molière shows that allowing pride, rather than reason, to dictate one’s actions invariably ends badly.
French President François Hollande appears to have an advanced case of Tartuffe’s malady, repeatedly making political pledges that he cannot honor, partly because of factors beyond his control – namely, the European Monetary Union (EMU) – but mostly because he lacks the determination.
For France, the consequences of Hollande’s failures will be much more dramatic than his political downfall.
Indeed, the country could be facing catastrophe, as Hollande’s actions risk miring the economy into sustained stagnation and driving an increasingly angry French public to elect the far-right National Front party’s Marine Le Pen as his successor.
France’s economic policies are untenable, meaning that both of the main determinants of those policies, the EMU and Hollande’s approach, must change radically.
So far, that does not seem to be happening.
Earlier this month, an opinion poll showed Hollande’s approval rating plummeting to 12% – the worst result for any French president in the history of modern polling.
On the same day, Hollande gave a long televised interview in which he combined admissions of failure with new promises.
Consider unemployment, which in September stood at 10.5%, compared to only 5% in Germany.
In the interview, Hollande acknowledged that, despite his pledge, a reversal of the negative employment trend “didn’t happen” this year.
(He failed to mention that he had set the same goal last year as well.)
France’s unemployment problem is the result of leviathan labor regulations (the labor code runs 3,648 pages) and, above all, a crippling tax burden on labor.
Hollande’s main new promise – not to impose any new taxes, beginning next year – might have been an implicit acknowledgement of this.
In the meantime, however, there will be an increase in diesel excise duties, and a 20% surcharge on property taxes will be imposed on unoccupied second homes in densely populated areas.
Because these tax hikes will likely be approved by the end of the year, they should be the last – if, that is, Hollande follows through on his pledge.
Given Hollande’s track record – the tax burden has risen by €40 billion ($50 billion) over the last two years – it seems unlikely that he will.
Indeed, Hollande’s own officials are already backpedaling, with the budget minister, Christian Eckert, stating that more tax hikes could not be ruled out: “You can’t set in stone a situation that depends on an international context that we don’t control.”
Of course, that “international context” is the EMU, which places considerable external constraints on French policy.
Even without such constraints, it is only prudent for fiscal policymakers to keep their options open.
Either way, the euro’s creators were wrong to expect that the common currency would promote economic and political convergence among its members.
By ruling out exchange-rate adjustment to address differences in competitiveness, the euro has forced less competitive countries to pursue painful and slow “internal devaluation” (suppressing real wages).
This has driven down demand and prices, causing the disparities among eurozone member countries’ economic performance to widen.
France now has a 2%-of-GDP current-account deficit, compared to Germany’s 8%-of-GDP surplus.
The deflationary impact of internal devaluation is compounded by the rule, reinforced in the 2012 “fiscal compact,” that eurozone countries are wholly responsible for their own debts and thus must adopt strict budgetary discipline.
With demand relentlessly squeezed, not even depressed wages can generate adequate employment.
The only solution, many euro supporters now contend, is full political union, which would allow for fiscal transfers from the eurozone’s more competitive countries to their weaker counterparts.
But southern Italy, which has not used the fiscal transfers from the north on which it has long depended to transform its economy or boost productivity, demonstrates how little impact this approach can have.
The notion that a eurozone fiscal union could do better is a dangerous fantasy.
Another potential approach would be for strong eurozone economies, especially Germany, to support productivity-enhancing structural reforms in less competitive countries like France and Italy.
This is probably what German Chancellor Angela Merkel meant when, in private discussions at last December’s European Council meeting, she reportedly said that, though Germany “cannot afford transfers to the whole of Europe,” it can “help to pay the doctors’ bills.”
But, sooner or later, the weaker economies will probably opt out of such reforms, reclaiming their monetary sovereignty as a necessary – though far from sufficient – means of averting economic and social breakdown.
In the meantime, Hollande will continue to channel Tartuffe.
Locked into the single currency, mainstream French politicians’ powerlessness to take real action renders their promises worthless.
As a result, France can expect popular protest, as well as a further increase in support for more extreme parties – above all, Le Pen’s National Front.
Hollywood’s Favorite Villains
Once upon a time, Cold War enemies, white supremacists, and evil geniuses reigned supreme as Hollywood’s favorite bad guys.
No more.
Today, it is multinational corporations that are increasingly being cast as the über-villains of our globalized world.
For all their subliminal paid promotions and subtle product placements, corporations are getting drubbed in the main story lines of our popular culture.
This treatment goes far beyond documentaries like Michael Moore’s polemical Fahrenheit 9/11 or The Corporation , an earnest if somewhat paranoid portrayal of multinational companies’ role in globalization.
It extends to mainstream hits like The Constant Gardener , in which the idealistic protagonists do battle with a malicious global pharmaceutical company that is bent on exploiting Africa’s misery to test experimental drugs.
To be sure, sociopathic corporations have populated books and films for more than a century.
But corporate villains, typically multinational companies, have never been so ubiquitous as today.
Is it unfair?
Most corporations, after all, are merely convenient mechanisms for ensuring that scarce global capital is used at maximum efficiency, to the benefit of all.
Are famously liberal Hollywood film directors spending too much time going to anti-globalization rallies?
Perhaps.
But I would submit that Hollywood’s misgivings, however untutored, represent only the tip of a growing iceberg of resentment against the perceived injustices of globalization.
The simple truth is that corporations represent capital, and capital – in the form of factories, equipment, machines, money, and even houses – has been the single biggest winner in the modern era of globalization.
Corporate profits are bursting at the seams of investors’ expectations in virtually every corner of the world.
Even in moribund economies like Germany and Italy, where employment security is vanishing, corporations are swimming in cash.
This phenomenon comes as no surprise to economists.
Add two billion Indian and Chinese workers to the global labor force, and the value of other means of production – particularly capital and commodities (for example, gold and oil) – is bound to go up.  And so it has, with capitalists everywhere gaining an ever larger share of the economic pie.
(In theory, capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers, but in practice they, too, have benefited thanks to their governments’ success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing.)
Many policymakers seem to be under the impression that surging profits are a purely cyclical phenomenon, as economies continue to grow out from the depths of the 2001 recession.
Wait a bit, they predict, and wages will fully catch up later in the cycle.
Not likely.
Capital’s piece of the pie has been getting bigger for more than 20 years, and the trend looks set to continue.
Indeed, corporations’ growing share of income has been a major driver behind the long, if uneven, bull market in stocks that began in the early 1990’s.
At the same time, inflation-adjusted wages for rich-country unskilled workers have barely budged over the last two decades.
Some of these trends also have to do with the nature of modern technological change, which seems to favor capital and skilled workers disproportionately.
But, regardless of their cause, rapidly growing inequalities are a powerful force for instability everywhere, from wealthy America to rapidly growing China to reform-challenged Europe.
“A rising tide lifts all boats,” conservatives like to say.
Fine, but what happens to people, like the poor of hurricane-struck New Orleans, who don’t own boats? 
Growing inequality would not be such a problem if governments could simply raise taxes on the rich and strengthen subsidies to the poor.
Unfortunately, any country that taxes capital too aggressively will only succeed in chasing it to regions where the tax burden is lighter.
In a globalized world, national governments’ ability to tax potentially mobile factors of production is sharply circumscribed.
The same mechanism that pours profits into the pockets of global corporations also prevents governments from claiming a larger share of the spoils.
Unfortunately, the long-term trend towards ever-lower income shares for unskilled workers is likely to continue over the coming decades, as modern technology permeates the globe, and as emerging markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe continue to integrate into global production.
This is not to say that unskilled workers are actually being made worse off by globalization in absolute terms; the vast majority are actually breaking even or better.
But unskilled workers’ incomes are not keeping pace with overall economic growth, and the resulting social strains are a ticking bomb. 
If so, then Hollywood’s cartoon-like caricatures of evil multinational corporations may some day seize mainstream consciousness, leading to political upheavals that shatter today’s social contract.
That won’t be good for profits, or for the poor.
Governments – and corporations – must find better ways to provide equal opportunity through improved education, broader financial markets, and other channels.
Otherwise, globalization’s storyline may not proceed according to the script.
Homeless at Home
Today, the United Nations estimates that 77 million people – more than 1% of the world’s population – are displaced within their own countries, having been forced to flee their homes by armed conflicts, violence, urbanization, development, and natural disasters.
This is more than the population of France, the United Kingdom, or Turkey.
These people are not “refugees,” because they have not crossed an international border, but their experiences are often equally devastating.
Today, the number of people who have been internally displaced by conflicts alone is twice that of refugees.
With the increasing pattern of internal, rather than international, armed conflicts, and the rising regularity of extreme weather events affecting millions of people, internal displacement poses an even greater challenge to future generations.
Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, and traumatized by the violence or sudden disaster that forced them to flee, the displaced are often thrust into an extremely precarious future with few resources.
Think of the 15 million Chinese displaced following the Sichuan earthquake, the more than two million Iraqis uprooted within their country’s borders by sectarian and other violence, the 2.4 million displaced in Darfur, or the hundreds of thousands who have fled Mogadishu in the last year.
In the last decade, those displaced by conflicts alone rose from 19 million to 26 million, with millions more displaced by disasters.
The plight of these victims long went unrecognized, as governments and the international community alike failed to acknowledge their rights to protection and assistance.
In 1998, the UN issued Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which sets out these legal rights.
Ten years on, what impact have the Principles had on displaced people’s lives?
The achievements are notable, if insufficient.
We have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced, brought about changes in government policies, and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs.
This has helped save countless lives.
Humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened, including through a new rapid funding mechanism, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.
But for every gain we have made, enormous difficulties still remain.
The number of those displaced by natural disasters is rising, as the adverse effects of climate change continue to mount.
Nine of every ten recorded disasters are now climate-related.
As many as 50 million people around the world are estimated to be displaced each year by floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and landslides.
However sudden the initial displacement, the impact can last for generations, together with a long-term need for clean water, shelter, health care, and other basic services, as victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998 know from bitter experience.
Nor are rich countries immune.
Two years after Hurricane Katrina, thousands of people remain in temporary shelters.
Moreover, violent armed groups, be they government-supported militias or rebel movements, increasingly embrace terror as a tactic to force civilians from their homes, as seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Iraq, and elsewhere.
Millions of people remain impoverished, face discrimination, and suffer long-lasting trauma even after the guns fall silent.
Life in camps is demoralizing and ultimately dehumanizing.
The world rightly focuses on the tragedy in Darfur, but overlooks another four million Sudanese still displaced as a result of the north-south conflict, many of whom continue to live in terrible poverty in Khartoum slums or in makeshift camps across the country, with little opportunity to re-build their lives.
We must prevent displacement from occurring, and end it as quickly as possible.
On the preventive front, countless lives can be saved by simple actions such as flood-proofing coastlines, or strengthening earthquake codes for hospitals and schools.
Countries like Bangladesh and Mozambique have proven that disaster risk reduction and preparedness can be a life-saving investment.
In conflict situations, preventing displacement primarily requires political will.
Those who forcibly displace civilians in violation of international law must be held accountable in order to deter others in the future.
States that are not involved in the conflict are also required to uphold the rights of the displaced, including the right to return to their homes wherever possible, and this must be addressed in peace agreements and enforced in peacekeeping mandates.
So here’s the bottom line: conflicts will continue and natural disasters are growing in frequency and intensity.
Addressing the root causes and reducing the impact of displacement should start by heeding victims’ voices – their needs and wishes must be understood and their rights respected.
The international community can help. But national authorities must lead.
Ten years after the Guiding Principles were signed, the time for excuses and inaction has run out.
Homeless in Iraq
BAGHDAD &#45;&#45; American officials report that the number of sectarian and other killings in Iraq has declined since the onset of the military “surge.”
But, while the number of killings may, indeed, have fallen, does that mean Iraq is really safer?
Insecurity in Iraq is most strikingly illustrated by the number of people fleeing their homes.
The United Nations estimates that, since July, the number has risen by 60,000 every month.
The best estimate is that around 16% of Iraq’s population, or one in six Iraqis, no longer live in their homes.
Roughly half of those who have fled have also left the country, implying two million refugees.
This leaves another two million who have been displaced internally, and who represent an emerging humanitarian tragedy.
There have been international reports and fundraising campaigns to support Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan, but the internally displaced have received less attention, despite their greater vulnerability, owing to their proximity to the conflict and the poor standard of basic services in Iraq.
They tend to be less visible, and it is more difficult for donors and agencies to assist them.
Internal displacement predates the 2003 Iraq invasion.
During former President Saddam Hussein’s rule, large numbers of people were forcibly relocated through either conflict or government policy.
Since 2003, displacement has affected all the peoples of Iraq, and the central reason remains the same – the use of violence to expel people from an area with the aim of increasing political and economic power.
Mixed neighborhoods across Iraq have been targeted by one side or another as sectarian violence has risen and local militias wield power.
The inability of the government or the multi-national force to curb this intimidation reflects the absence of the rule of law.
Other factors causing displacement include operations of the multinational force itself, crime, the lack of basic services, and desperate poverty.
The complexity of Iraq’s society and history means that many people have been displaced more than once, or have returned from exile only to become internally displaced.
According to the UN, 69% of those displaced since February 2006 come from Baghdad, which demonstrates the extent of the “sectarianization” of the capital.
Thus, one reason for the “success” claimed by supporters of the military surge may well be that sectarian cleansing in Baghdad has been hugely effective and is now nearly complete.
Displaced Iraqis who remain in the country move to areas where their community is strong.
Displaced Shi’a tend to move from the center of the country to the south, Sunnis from the south to the center, and Christians to Nineveh province.
In mixed cities such as Baghdad and Baquba, those forced to move gravitate towards newly homogenized districts.
Most displaced people rent accommodation, stay with family or friends, or squat, while a smaller number take refuge in camps.
There are big refugee camps in Kerbala, Wasit, Diyala, and Nineveh, but most of the displacement is urban rather than camp-based, and thousands of displaced families live in major cities such as Baghdad and Mosul.
These people now account for many of the eight million Iraqis who are in absolute poverty and in need of emergency assistance.
Education is minimal, health care is inadequate, and many die without even being accounted for.
Whereas between 25% and 40% of Iraqis may require food assistance at any given time, this figure is much higher for displaced people, owing to their poor access to the public distribution system.
Only a third of the displaced had access to the system last year, while half reported receiving food rations only occasionally.
It is a new phenomenon in Iraq to see people, particularly women and children, looking in the rubbish every day for something to eat.
In such conditions, many young people feel they have little choice but to join violent groups, if only to provide some income and a level of protection.
Female-headed households, in particular, face great difficulties in protecting and supporting their families.
There are increasing reports of Iraqi women resorting to prostitution and of trafficking in women and children to neighboring countries.
The government recently announced the extension of a program of emergency cash allowances to widows.
However, this is insufficient to help most of the three million widows, while corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency hamper efforts further.
Another tragedy of the current conflict has been its impact on minority communities, which make up 10% of the population and are targets for eradication.
Violent attacks have caused a huge exodus, jeopardizing the existence of Christians, Yazidis, and Mandeans, who have lived in Iraq for hundreds of years.
Despite the vulnerability of minorities, the religious breakdown of displaced people closely reflects that of the country: 64% Shi’a, 32% Sunni, and 4% Christian.
But the ethnic breakdown of displaced people – 93% Arab, 4% Assyrian, and 1% Kurd – illustrates the grave insecurity in central Iraq and the relative stability of Kurdistan.
With the prospects of return continuing to deteriorate, prolonged displacement may well become permanent.
Should levels of displacement remain high, as appears likely, the humanitarian crisis may deepen further, especially because strained local resources have led some governorates to begin refusing to admit displaced people.
Their predicament, too, must be reflected in any calculation of Iraq’s security conditions.
Home Sweet Second Home
Whenever I speak at finance and economics conferences around the world, I find that a great conversation starter with the spouses of the middle-aged business people who attend is to inquire about their vacation home.
I then find myself entertained by stories of gorgeous ocean sunsets seen from the porch, views onto expanses of colorful wildflowers on mountainsides, and happy family reunions in beautiful seclusion (as well as problems with the plumbing).
Years ago, I never asked about vacation homes.
They never seemed so much on people’s minds.
Purchases of second homes for pleasure were confined to the rich, and thus did not seem quite so much of a conversation topic for the rank-and-file business people that I meet at such conferences.
But now the world is undergoing a second-home boom: an increasing number of people are buying vacation homes in beautiful and fun places that are within a few hours’ flying time from their first homes and jobs.
Their second homes are a retreat where they will spend only a fraction of the year, and recently pristine mountain ridges and ocean cliffs are being dotted with new homes to meet the demand.
A study by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) indicates that 13% of all homes purchased in the United States in 2004 were vacation homes.
This does not include buyers who purchased homes as investment properties, mostly to rent out.
According to the NAR, investment buyers account for another 23% of home sales, bringing second-home purchases to 36% of the total.
Some of the US counties with a high proportion of vacation homes are seeing price increases that rival, if not outstrip, the booming metropolitan areas.
For example, according to the Case-Shiller Indexes, home prices in the fashionable Cape Cod vacation area in Massachusetts soared 184% from 1997 to 2005, compared to the 131% increase in nearby Boston over the same period.
America is not alone.
Europeans are buying gemütliche Alpine ski chalets, glamorous condominiums with Mediterranean views in the South of Spain, and, increasingly, villas in picturesque sites in Turkey, Hungary, and Croatia.
Australians are buying oceanfront properties at the Sunshine Coast and the Whitsundays.
Japan’s vacation-home boom of the 1980’s has largely fizzled with its collapsing stock market and urban land market.
But even there, the market for vacation homes remains hot in places like Karuizawa, Lake Kawaguchi, and Hakone.
Being able to afford a vacation home in beautiful surroundings may mean a lot to some people.
Indeed, sometimes the talk that I hear about these properties seems to integrate them into the true meaning of life.
After all, where do we imagine that philosophers and poets and gurus live?
In one of these captivatingly charming places, of course, and not as tourists in hotel rooms.
Most people who couldn’t possibly afford such a vacation home probably don’t miss it.
Craving one seems to be a desire, like fine wine, that one discovers only when one has substantial wealth.
So, as global economic growth continues, and as household incomes rise in today’s most populous emerging countries, demand – and thus prices – for vacation homes in beautiful places, either at home or abroad, will most likely soar.
There is reason to worry about this.
Real GDP has been growing at around 3% a year in many advanced countries, and twice that or more in some emerging countries.
Properties in beautiful places are likely to be what economists call “superior goods” – those goods that account for a higher proportion of consumption as incomes rise.
With fixed supply, rents on these properties should increase at a rate equal to or above the rate of GDP growth.
Prices could increase much faster at times.
On the other hand, in some places, a speculative bubble is fueling today’s boom in vacation-home prices.
The vacation-home boom appears psychologically tied to the urban home-price bubble in many of the world’s “glamour cities,” and prices of these vacation homes are similarly vulnerable to a significant drop in coming years.
Moreover, there are plenty of ways for the construction industry to offer untold millions more people the opportunity to call some beautiful place home, simply by building more high-density and high-rise vacation apartment buildings there.
Many of the single-family vacation mansions or low-density apartment buildings that are being built today will likely eventually be sold, torn down, and replaced with higher-density megastructures, boosting supply and thus easing pressure on prices of the remaining low-density vacation homes.
Such higher-density construction must be the best possible outcome, for it will please the most people.
Most vacationers seem to derive a sense of excitement from the presence of many other vacationers around them. Large numbers of people contribute to a holiday atmosphere and attract entertainment and sports industries.
But, for many of those who imagine relaxing in a place that offers a quaint life of undisturbed beauty, there is a strong risk that prices will rise out of reach in future decades.
No economic strategy can change that, even if it produces spectacular GDP growth.
Hope for Hong Kong
LONDON – Hong Kong’s democracy movement has gained admiration worldwide.
The principles, decency, and behavior of its youthful vanguard inspire confidence in the qualities of the generation that one day will run the great city.
That said, it is time to move on to a sensible endgame.
The longer the standoff between Hong Kong’s Chief Executive and the demonstrators continues, the more likely it is that individual citizens – and Hong Kong itself – will be hurt.
The Hong Kong government should demonstrate some statesmanship, which the so-called “Umbrella Movement” – occupying the moral high ground and not wishing to risk losing public support – would surely reciprocate.
A substantive and successful dialogue with the government would not require the protesters to call off their campaign for democracy; it would simply end the current phase of a campaign that eventually will succeed.
Despite their protestations to the contrary, Hong Kong Chief Executive C. Y. Leung and his government have considerable room for maneuver.
As many Hong Kong citizens have argued, the Chinese government’s current position is based on a report, submitted by Leung’s officials, which purported to reflect accurately the outcome of local consultations on constitutional development.
But the report plainly understated the degree of public support for change.
Given what has happened in the last few weeks, Leung could quite properly give a new report to the authorities in Beijing focusing on two issues not proscribed by Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
The first issue concerns not just the immediate question of the terms on which the Chief Executive will be elected in 2017, but also how the Legislative Council should be elected in 2016 and after.
The procedure is largely a matter for the Hong Kong government to decide.
It is surprising that 17 years after the handover of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, Hong Kong still does not have a directly elected legislature.
In December 1992, Margaret Thatcher suggested in a speech in the House of Lords that, if all went well, Hong Kong could have universal suffrage by 2007.
Unfortunately, all has not gone well.
The legislature today comprises a mix of directly elected members and those representing functional constituencies: corporate interests and groups of employees.
Some civic groups have advocated increasing the number of directly elected legislators and opening up the functional constituencies to broader electorates.
Moreover, the brake that the functional constituencies can put on legislation should be scrapped, leaving decisions to a simple majority.
This could be accompanied by a pledge to create a legislature composed entirely of directly elected members in 2020.
The second issue concerns the composition and the voting rules of the handpicked 1,200-member election committee that will choose the Chief Executive in the future.
The current proposed arrangements would permit the Chinese government to veto any candidate that it did not like, prompting criticism that what is on offer is an Iranian-style election: “You can vote for anyone we choose.”
The Hong Kong government could call for changes to increase the openness and fairness by which the Chief Executive is chosen, without abandoning its current method in favor of universal suffrage.
According to the Basic Law, the election committee should be “broadly representative” – a provision that the committee’s current composition violates.
Its membership is chosen by only 7% of the total Hong Kong electorate, and its voting procedures seek to prevent the nomination of any candidates who may harbor democratic sympathies.
Since 1997, 55-61% of voters have voted for democratic candidates in Legislative Council elections.
The last time a slightly smaller election committee met (to choose Leung), less restrictive constraints on candidate selection were in place, and the leader of the Democratic Party was able to be nominated (though he still received less than 7% of the vote).
So Leung and his team should put forward proposals to broaden the electoral base of the election committee and open up the nominating process for candidates.
There are plenty of recommendations from civil-society groups about how to accomplish these objectives.
Both sides will need to give a little to prevent the confrontation in the streets from escalating, with the police forced to provide a substitute for a sensible policy.
The British government has said that it is important that “the people of Hong Kong have a genuine choice.”
Leung and his colleagues can give them one.
This would not be all that the Umbrella Movement has demanded, but it should encourage the protesters to reach a compromise without departing from their longer-term goal.
That is why Leung should embrace dialogue and compromise.
Even a ruler whose mandate comes from heaven should heed the words of the Confucian sage Mencius: “Heaven sees with the eyes of its people.
Heaven hears with the ears of its people.”
The Way Ahead in Hong Kong
LONDON – It is not wholly true to say that the eyes of the entire world are on Hong Kong.
They would be, of course, if people in mainland China were allowed to know what is happening in their country’s most successful city.
But China’s government has tried to block any news about the Hong Kong democracy demonstrations from reaching the rest of the country – not exactly a sign of confidence on the part of China’s rulers in their system of authoritarian government.
Before suggesting a way forward for Hong Kong’s ham-fisted authorities, three things need to be made clear.
First, it is a slur on the integrity and principles of Hong Kong’s citizens to assert, as the Chinese government’s propaganda machine does, that they are being manipulated by outside forces.
What motivates Hong Kong’s tens of thousands of demonstrators is a passionate belief that they should be able to run their affairs as they were promised, choosing those who govern them in free and fair elections.
Second, others outside of Hong Kong have a legitimate interest in what happens in the city.
Hong Kong is a great international center, whose freedoms and autonomy were guaranteed in a treaty registered at the United Nations.
In particular, the United Kingdom, the other party to this Sino-British Joint Declaration, sought and received guarantees that the survival of Hong Kong’s autonomy and liberties would be guaranteed for 50 years.
So it is ridiculous to suggest that British ministers and parliamentarians should keep their noses out of Hong Kong’s affairs.
In fact, they have a right and a moral obligation to continue to check on whether China is keeping its side of the bargain – as, to be fair, it has mostly done so far.
But, third, the biggest problems have arisen because of a dispute about where Hong Kong’s promised path to democracy should take it, and when.
No one told Hong Kongers when they were assured of universal suffrage that it would not mean being able to choose for whom they could vote.
No one said that Iran was the democratic model that China’s Communist bureaucracy had in mind, with the Chinese government authorized to exercise an effective veto over candidates.
In fact, that is not what China had in mind.
As early as 1993, China’s chief negotiator on Hong Kong, Lu Ping, told the newspaper People’s Daily, “The [method of universal suffrage] should be reported to [China’s Parliament] for the record, whereas the central government’s agreement is not necessary.
How Hong Kong develops its democracy in the future is completely within the sphere of the autonomy of Hong Kong.
The central government will not interfere.”
The following year, China’s foreign ministry confirmed this.
The British Parliament summarized what had been said and promised in a report on Hong Kong in 2000.
“The Chinese government has therefore formally accepted that it is for the Hong Kong government to determine the extent and nature of democracy in Hong Kong.”
So, what next?
The peaceful demonstrators in Hong Kong, with their umbrellas and refuse-collection bags, will not themselves be swept off the streets like garbage or bullied into submission by tear gas and pepper spray.
Any attempt to do so would present a terrible and damaging picture of Hong Kong and China to the world, and would be an affront to all that China should aspire to be.
The Hong Kong authorities have gravely miscalculated the views of their citizens.
Like the bad courtiers against whom Confucius warned, they went to Beijing and told the emperor what they thought he wanted to hear, not what the situation really was in the city.
They must think again.
Under the existing plans, there is supposed to be a second phase of consultations on democratic development to follow what turned out to be a counterfeit start to the process.
Hong Kong’s government should now offer its people a proper second round of consultation, one that is open and honest.
Dialogue is the only sensible way forward.
Hong Kong’s citizens are not irresponsible or unreasonable.
A decent compromise that allows for elections that people can recognize as fair, not fixed, is surely available.
The demonstrators in Hong Kong, young and old, represent the city’s future.
Their hopes are for a peaceful and prosperous life in which they can enjoy the freedoms and rule of law that they were promised.
That is not only in the interest of their city; it is in China’s interest, too.
Hong Kong’s future is the main issue; but so, too, is China’s honor and its standing in the world.
Hong Kong Holds its Breath
Hong Kong's residents used to be branded as "apolitical."
But that description hardly seems appropriate nowadays.
Since turning out to rally in record numbers on the anniversary of the handover to China in 2003, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens have taken peacefully to the streets on various occasions to protest government decisions and demand political reform.
But China's government clings to the belief that Hong Kong's people are not ready for democracy.
In April 2004, China's legislators ruled out universal suffrage in Hong Kong's 2007 election of its chief executive, as well as for its 2008 Legislative Council election.
They acknowledged that under the city's special constitution, the Basic Law, these elections could be the first opportunities for the territory to choose its representatives according to the principle of "one person, one vote."
But they expressed concern that major reform could undermine political stability and economic development.
Currently, all eyes in China are on Hong Kong's upcoming legislative election on September 12, which will indicate to Hong Kong's government and to China's leaders what people think about the pace and direction of reform.
A high turnout in favor of pro-democracy candidates is expected, although this won't guarantee them a majority in the legislature because of Hong Kong's unusual political structure.
For this month's election, Hong Kong's 3.2 million registered voters can elect only 30 of the 60 seats.
The pro-democracy camp is likely to win 22 seats of those 30 seats, which are based on five large geographical constituencies.
The other 30 seats, however, are chosen through functional constituencies, which represent specific interests, such as banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers, chambers of commerce, and transport operators.
Only 199,000 voters, some of them representatives from corporations, elect the legislators who fill these seats.
Some of these constituencies have only a few hundred voters and are easily controlled by a small number of vested interests.
Indeed, at the close of nomination on August 4, eleven functional candidates were chosen without opposition, including those representing banks and the Chinese chamber of commerce.
The British and Chinese governments in the 1980's designed Hong Kong's awkward political system during their negotiations over the eventual transfer of sovereignty.
Its purpose was to ensure that the will of the public could not be fully expressed through the ballot box.
After 1997, Hong Kong's government made doubly sure that legislators' already limited powers to initiate debates, legislation, and amendments to laws were further restricted.
It imposed rules requiring majority support from members of functional constituencies as well as geographic constituencies to take such steps.
So resistance to change is built into the system.
If the government can influence 16 of the 30 functional votes, it can thwart proposals from the directly elected legislators.
This has happened with controversial issues concerning political reform and government accountability over the past few years.
Yet no one should forget that on July 1, 2003, over 500,000 people protested because the government refused to allow more time to discuss proposed national security legislation.
Hong Kong's government felt it could ignore public opinion and push the bill through with a large majority of the functional members, plus a handful of directly elected pro-government legislators.
It only backed down when the pro-government Liberal Party, which held a number of functional seats, broke ranks as a result of intense public pressure.
The Civic Exchange-Hong Kong Transition Project's latest survey results, from early August, recorded a sharp upturn in public protests over the past year.
It noted that people increasingly adopted informal means of expressing unhappiness with Hong Kong's government, because they did not think that formal channels were sufficient.
People began taking matters into their own hands by attending rallies, signing petitions, and donating to political parties and activist groups in unprecedented numbers.
The survey also showed that although China's government ruled out universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections, over 40% of respondents still wanted democracy by then, with nearly 20% more wanting it by the next round of elections in 2011 and 2012.
Furthermore, the majority did not think democratization would hurt the economy, although there were clear concerns that political instability could arise from China's intervention in Hong Kong affairs.
China's government may well adopt a new Hong Kong policy after the election.
The best case would be if China agreed to universal suffrage no later than the 2011 and 2012 elections, gaining legitimacy in Hong Kong by backing reform of the political system.
While China's rulers may fear losing control, they also need to recognize that the current system is causing intense discontent.
The worst case would be if China disregarded a decisive pro-democracy win in 2007 and 2008 and continued to insist that Hong Kong's people were unready for democracy or to allege foreign manipulation of the pro-democracy camp.
Hong Kong's people may well conclude that they have no alternative but to use every occasion to protest chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's unpopular government, making it even harder for him to govern.
Hong Kong’s Independence Trap
LONDON – Nearly 40 years ago, when I visited Moscow for the first time, my initial reaction was surprise.
The hotels and restaurants were so poorly run that it seemed shocking that the military could be run competently enough to pose a genuine threat to the Soviet Union’s adversaries.
Yet we in the West feared the Red Army – and with good reason.
Hong Kong, my favorite city, sends the opposite message.
Its restaurants are run with precision, and it boasts some of the world’s best hotels.
Surely any city that can look after visitors so superbly should have nothing to worry about, except, perhaps, how best to use the proceeds of its competence and entrepreneurial genius.
But, again, things may not be quite what they seem.
Hong Kong’s success partly reflects a fundamental moderation within the culture, a competency and rationality that enables the city – an autonomous Chinese territory – to thrive in a complex context.
But, when I visited Hong Kong last month – my first visit since the momentous but abortive democracy demonstrations of 2014 – people seemed more nervous than they had in some time.
The reason is that a fledgling independence movement is shaking things up in Hong Kong.
It started with characteristically moderate calls for greater democracy.
But menacing noises from China, together with the Hong Kong government’s failure to attempt a sensible dialogue with its critics about governance concerns or economic challenges, has driven many democracy activists to extremism.
This is unwise.
The reality is that Hong Kong is not an incipient nation-state, and it will not become one.
China would oppose this idea to the bitter end.
It is not a fight Hong Kong would win.
Instead, Hong Kong is a Chinese city with a strong sense of identity as a free, plural, decent, and open society under the rule of law.
This is what democracy activists should be discussing.
This is where they are on sound footing and can advance positive goals.
As soon as those activists begin demanding independence, however, they risk splintering their support and losing the moral high ground that they gained with their campaign in 2014.
This plays into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party and its stooges in Hong Kong.
As if demanding independence were not damaging enough to the pro-democracy cause, some independence campaigners are using brash tactics that are guaranteed to backfire.
Most consequential, two young pro-independence campaigners who were elected to the Legislative Council – Yau Wai-ching and Sixtus Leung – chose to make a mockery of their oath of office last September.
Such oaths are common for legislators.
In the United Kingdom, for example, you cannot assume your role as an elected representative without taking one.
But Yau and Leung wanted to win publicity for their cause.
So they altered the words of the oath; displayed a banner stating that “Hong Kong is not China”; and referred to China using what many consider a slur.
Yau and Leung immediately incurred the wrath of China’s central government.
Although the Hong Kong courts surely could have dealt with the issue themselves – under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong is assured an independent court system, in addition to the right to elect its own legislature – an enraged China intervened.
Restraint is not, after all, a Leninist virtue.
In an extraordinary move, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee stepped in to “clarify” Article 104 of the Basic Law, declaring that all oaths taken by office-holders must be “solemn, accurate, complete, and sincere.”
Yau and Leung were barred from taking their seats in the Legislative Council.
To most Hong Kong lawyers, the display of political authority did not represent simply a reinterpretation of old rules, but a move toward making new ones.
And, in fact, Hong Kong’s government is now launching legal challenges against four more legislators – all relatively moderate pro-democracy activists – arguing that their oaths of office were also invalid.
In short, Hong Kong’s democracy may now be more constrained than it was before.
It is depressing to see Hong Kong once more bereft of inclusive leadership and roiled by political grandstanding.
If this situation persists, China’s moves to assert more authority in Hong Kong could well become even more brazen.
That is why it is so important for the people of Hong Kong to ensure that their vision is not clouded by extremism, and to stand up to protect the virtues that comprise their unique identity.
Fortunately, there are many in Hong Kong doing just that.
The legal profession, in particular, continues to show brave leadership in upholding the rule of law, a target of regular criticism by Communist Party officials who either do not understand what it means or know all too well.
Similarly, civil-society organizations such as the Project Citizens Foundation are committed to educating the public on Hong Kong’s rules and rights.
Thanks partly to their efforts, the public tends to be knowledgeable and vigilant about encroachment on Hong Kong’s freedoms, such as the recent abduction of five book publishers by mainland agents.
These are anxious times for Hong Kong.
But the problem is not so entrenched that it could not be solved by a bold attempt to forge a consensus between the government and those whom it is supposed to serve.
With enough political will – and level heads – Hong Kong can return to a path leading toward a freer, more open democracy.
Who Loves China?
NEW YORK – Tens of thousands of people have been “occupying” the tear-gas-filled streets of Hong Kong’s Central district to fight for their democratic rights.
Many more may soon join them.
Though some businessmen and bankers are annoyed by the disruption, the demonstrators are right to protest.
China’s government has promised Hong Kong’s citizens that they can freely elect their Chief Executive in 2017.
But, given that candidates are to be carefully vetted by an unelected committee of pro-Chinese appointees, citizens would have no meaningful choice at all.
Only people who “love China” – that is, love the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – need apply.
One can almost understand why China’s leaders should be baffled by this show of defiance in Hong Kong.
After all, the British simply appointed governors when Hong Kong was still a crown colony, and nobody protested then.
Indeed, the deal that Hong Kong’s colonial subjects appeared to accept – leaving politics alone in exchange for the opportunity to pursue material prosperity in a safe and orderly environment – is not so different from the deal accepted by China’s educated classes today.
The common opinion among British colonial civil servants, businessmen, and diplomats was that the Chinese were not really interested in politics anyway; all they cared about was money.
Anyone with the slightest knowledge of Chinese history knows that this view was patently false.
But, for a long time, it seemed to be true in Hong Kong.
There was, however, a significant difference between Hong Kong under the British and under China today.
Hong Kong was never a democracy, but it did have a relatively free press, a relatively honest government, and an independent judiciary – all backed by a democratic government in London.
For most Hong Kong citizens, the prospect of being handed over in 1997 from one colonial power to another was never an entirely happy one.
But what really invigorated politics in Hong Kong was the brutal crackdown in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square and in other Chinese cities in 1989.
Huge demonstrations took place in Hong Kong to protest the massacre, and massive commemorations of the event are held every June, keeping alive a memory that is repressed and fading in the rest of China.
It was not simply humanitarian rage that galvanized so many people in Hong Kong to act in 1989.
They recognized then that under future Chinese rule, only genuine democracy might safeguard the institutions that protected Hong Kong’s freedoms.
Without any significant say in how they were to be governed, Hong Kong’s citizens would be at the mercy of China’s leaders.
From the point of view of China’s Communist rulers, this seems perverse.
They regard Hong Kongers’ democratic demands as a misguided effort to mimic Western politics, or even as a form of nostalgia for British imperialism.
Either way, the demonstrators’ agenda is considered “anti-Chinese.”
The way China’s rulers see it, only firm control from the top and the CCP’s unquestioned supremacy can create the conditions needed for a rich and powerful China to emerge.
Democracy, in their view, leads to disorder; freedom of thought causes popular “confusion”; and public criticism of the Party tends toward the breakdown of authority.
In this sense, the CCP is rather traditional.
But, though Chinese government always was authoritarian, it was not always as corrupt as it is now.
Nor were China’s politics always as lawless.
China traditionally had institutions – clan associations, religious communities, business groups, and so on – that were relatively autonomous.
Imperial rule may have been authoritarian, but there were large pockets of independence from central control.
In that sense, Hong Kong is perhaps more traditional than the rest of China, excluding, of course, Taiwan.
Today, the CCP’s political supremacy places it above the law, which encourages corruption among Party officials, whether at the local or national level.
Strict Party control of religious, academic, artistic, and journalistic expression stifles the dissemination of necessary information and creative thought.
The lack of an independent judiciary undermines the rule of law.
None of this benefits future development.
When Hong Kong was formally handed back to China 17 years ago, some optimists thought that the former colony’s greater freedoms would help to reform the rest of China.
The example of a clean bureaucracy and independent judges would strengthen the rule of law throughout the country.
Others, for the same reason, regarded Hong Kong as a dangerous Trojan horse that could seriously undermine the Communist order.
So far, there is no evidence that the protesters in Hong Kong’s Central district have any ambition to undermine, let alone topple, the government in Beijing.
They have their hands full just standing up for their own rights in Hong Kong, and the chance that they will succeed appears to be slim.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is anxious to show how tough he can be.
Compromise would smack of weakness.
His aim seems to be to make Hong Kong more like the rest of China, rather than the other way round.
And yet, there is every reason to believe that China would benefit greatly from the opposite course.
Less official corruption, more trust in the law, and greater freedom of thought would make China a more stable, more creative, and even more prosperous society.
In the short term, this probably will not happen.
But the people who truly “love China” are more likely to be found in the streets of Hong Kong than in the closed government compounds of Beijing.
China’s Hong Kong Follies
HONG KONG – The massive public demonstrations by students and young members of the middle-class that have roiled Hong Kong in recent weeks are ostensibly demands for democracy.
But they actually reflect frustration among a population that has been poorly governed by a succession of leaders picked by China’s central government more for their loyalty than their competence.
In fact, the current near-uprising is the culmination of a long series of demonstrations since Hong Kong’s handover from the United Kingdom to China in 1997, after Chris Patten, the last British governor failed to persuade China to allow Hong Kong to establish a genuine democratic government.
In China’s view, Patten’s position was hypocritical, even offensive, given that the British had ruled Hong Kong autocratically.
China believed that it could easily manage the same kind of “executive-led” government that had served Hong Kong well for 150 years under the British.
In order to placate Hong Kong’s restive population – which included many refugees from China – a “one country, two systems” policy was embedded in the region’s constitution, promising Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy,” except in foreign and defense affairs for 50 years.
Indeed, Hong Kong enjoys many freedoms that the rest of China lacks, including a judiciary system that is guided by British common law and independent from the executive branch.
China has yet to follow through on its second promise: that Hong Kong would elect its chief executive by “universal suffrage” by 2017.
Instead, a committee – initially comprising 800 members, but since expanded to 1,200 – selects the chief executive in accordance with the Chinese government’s wishes.
Hong Kong’s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, was widely viewed as a wise choice.
The Western-educated heir to a shipping fortune, and unusually well connected with the global elite, Tung was thought to be a conservative, thoughtful, cosmopolitan man imbued with liberal values and free of ties to the powerful families that dominated the real-estate industry in the territory.
This perception could not have been more wrong.
Tung turned out to be shallow, radical in his views, more chauvinist than China’s top leaders, and prone to rash decision-making on important policies with wide-ranging social and economic consequences.
He forced out his competent chief secretary, Anson Chan, a veteran Hong Kong civil servant, for her colonial background, thereby signaling his mistrust of the entire civil service that the British had created.
It did not take long for Hong Kongers to realize that their new leader harbored a deep – and deeply flawed – “patriotic” worldview that regarded Western “values” as unsuitable for Hong Kong, the first globalized Chinese city in modern history.
But it was not until Tung tried to ram through draconian internal-security legislation that many of Hong Kong’s citizens began to feel that they were being overtaken by the repressive governance from which they were supposed to be exempt.
Under Tung’s leadership, mass protests became a frequent sight in Hong Kong.
The Chinese government also belatedly recognized that Tung was a liability.
In 2004, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao unceremoniously dressed down Tung on live television.
Three months later, Tung resigned for “health reasons” and was elected Vice Chairman of the largely symbolic Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.
Tung’s successor, Donald Tsang, was chosen reluctantly.
But he was a senior civil servant, and seemed to be the only technocrat who could credibly hold together Hong Kong’s disaffected civil service, which China knew was indispensable to governing the territory, regardless of its British heritage.
But Tsang brought his own weaknesses to Hong Kong’s government – most notably, greed.
Tsang, who enjoyed spending time with the wealthy on their yachts and in their private suites, pursued a restrictive land policy that boosted real-estate values – and thus the wealth of the land-owning tycoons.
Prices rose so high, however, that real estate became accessible only to the very well-off, such as the families of high officials from the mainland.
This kind of corrupt behavior earned Tsang a disgraceful exit from government.
Next came Leung Chun-ying, the current governor.
Leung – who was not China’s first choice for the position – inherited a mess.
But he did not do himself any favors with his cabinet choices, many of whom had mediocre records that indicated corruptibility.
One of them, Paul Chan Mo-po, was tasked with managing Hong Kong’s land-supply policy, despite a history of corruption in his personal property transactions.
Worse, Leung pushed forward an unpopular plan to introduce “patriotic education” to Hong Kong, stoking fear among students of a China-dictated brainwashing.
After the failure of three consecutive Chinese-selected leaders to address Hong Kong’s concerns, it is no wonder that Hong Kong’s citizens are increasingly seeking to loosen China’s grip on their government.
But, for the Chinese authorities, this movement reflects an unacceptable challenge to China’s sovereignty.
In this sense, Hong Kong is locked in a vicious circle – and it is up to China’s government to break it.
The fact is that Hong Kong’s citizens understand that they need China, and they have no interest in subverting the central government – nor do they have the power to do so.
Their demands for democracy are simply calls for good governance.
They believe that free and fair elections represent their best chance of having a competent leader – someone like Patten, China’s former nemesis, who is remembered fondly in Hong Kong.
China’s government is doing itself a disservice by demanding that Hong Kong’s citizens bow before their sovereign, while blaming “outside hostile forces” for spurring some kind of unconstitutional rebellion.
Instead, it should focus on the problems created by the chief executives that it chose for the wrong reasons, and it should resolve the underlying governance problems that the demonstrations reflect.
The New Geo-Economics
COLOMBO, SRI LANKA – Last year was a memorable one for the global economy.
Not only was overall performance disappointing, but profound changes – both for better and for worse – occurred in the global economic system.
Most notable was the Paris climate agreement reached last month.
By itself, the agreement is far from enough to limit the increase in global warming to the target of 2º Celsius above the pre-industrial level.
But it did put everyone on notice: The world is moving, inexorably, toward a green economy.
One day not too far off, fossil fuels will be largely a thing of the past.
So anyone who invests in coal now does so at his or her peril.
With more green investments coming to the fore, those financing them will, we should hope, counterbalance powerful lobbying by the coal industry, which is willing to put the world at risk to advance its shortsighted interests.
Indeed, the move away from a high-carbon economy, where coal, gas, and oil interests often dominate, is just one of several major changes in the global geo-economic order.
Many others are inevitable, given China’s soaring share of global output and demand.
The New Development Bank, established by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), was launched during the year, becoming the first major international financial institution led by emerging countries.
And, despite US President Barack Obama’s resistance, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was established as well, and is to start operation this month.
The US did act with greater wisdom where China’s currency was concerned.
It did not obstruct the renminbi’s admission to the basket of currencies that constitute the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
In addition, a half-decade after the Obama administration agreed to modest changes in the voting rights of China and other emerging markets at the IMF – a small nod to the new economic realities – the US Congress finally approved the reforms.
The most controversial geo-economic decisions last year concerned trade.
Almost unnoticed after years of desultory talks, the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Round – initiated to redress imbalances in previous trade agreements that favored developed countries – was given a quiet burial.
America’s hypocrisy – advocating free trade but refusing to abandon subsidies on cotton and other agricultural commodities – had posed an insurmountable obstacle to the Doha negotiations.
In place of global trade talks, the US and Europe have mounted a divide-and-conquer strategy, based on overlapping trade blocs and agreements.
As a result, what was intended to be a global free-trade regime has given way to a discordant managed-trade regime.
Trade for much of the Pacific and Atlantic regions will be governed by agreements, thousands of pages in length and replete with complex rules of origin that contradict basic principles of efficiency and the free flow of goods.
The US concluded secret negotiations on what may turn out to be the worst trade agreement in decades, the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and now faces an uphill battle for ratification, as all the leading Democratic presidential candidates and many of the Republicans have weighed in against it.
The problem is not so much with the agreement’s trade provisions, but with the “investment” chapter, which severely constrains environmental, health, and safety regulation, and even financial regulations with significant macroeconomic impacts.
In particular, the chapter gives foreign investors the right to sue governments in private international tribunals when they believe government regulations contravene the TPP’s terms (inscribed on more than 6,000 pages).
In the past, such tribunals have interpreted the requirement that foreign investors receive “fair and equitable treatment” as grounds for striking down new government regulations – even if they are non-discriminatory and are adopted simply to protect citizens from newly discovered egregious harms.
While the language is complex – inviting costly lawsuits pitting powerful corporations against poorly financed governments – even regulations protecting the planet from greenhouse-gas emissions are vulnerable.
The only regulations that appear safe are those involving cigarettes (lawsuits filed against Uruguay and Australia for requiring modest labeling about health hazards had drawn too much negative attention). But there remain a host of questions about the possibility of lawsuits in myriad other areas.
Furthermore, a “most favored nation” provision ensures that corporations can claim the best treatment offered in any of a host country’s treaties.
