That sets up a race to the bottom – exactly the opposite of what US President Barack Obama promised.
Even the way Obama argued for the new trade agreement showed how out of touch with the emerging global economy his administration is.
He repeatedly said that the TPP would determine who – America or China – would write the twenty-first century’s trade rules.
The correct approach is to arrive at such rules collectively, with all voices heard, and in a transparent way.
Obama has sought to perpetuate business as usual, whereby the rules governing global trade and investment are written by US corporations for US corporations.
This should be unacceptable to anyone committed to democratic principles.
Those seeking closer economic integration have a special responsibility to be strong advocates of global governance reforms: If authority over domestic policies is ceded to supranational bodies, then the drafting, implementation, and enforcement of the rules and regulations has to be particularly sensitive to democratic concerns.
Unfortunately, that was not always the case in 2015.
In 2016, we should hope for the TPP’s defeat and the beginning of a new era of trade agreements that don’t reward the powerful and punish the weak.
The Paris climate agreement may be a harbinger of the spirit and mindset needed to sustain genuine global cooperation.
Hopeless Unemployment
BERKELEY – However bad you think the global economy is today in terms of the business cycle, that is only one lens through which to view the world.
In terms of global life expectancy, total world wealth, the overall level of technology, growth prospects in emerging economies, and global income distribution, things look rather good, while on still other dimensions – say, global warming or domestic income inequality and its effects on countries’ social solidarity – they look bad.
Even on the business-cycle dimension, conditions have been far worse in the past than they are today.
Consider the Great Depression and the implications of market economies’ inability back then to recover on their own, owing to the burden of long-term unemployment.
But, while we are not at that point today, the Great Depression is no less relevant for us, because it is increasingly likely that long-term unemployment will become a similar impediment to recovery within the next two years.
At its nadir in the winter of 1933, the Great Depression was a form of collective insanity.
Workers were idle because firms would not hire them; firms would not hire them because they saw no market for their output; and there was no market for output because workers had no incomes to spend.
By that point, a great deal of unemployment had become long-term unemployment, which had two consequences.
First, the burden of economic dislocation was borne unequally.
Because consumer prices fell faster than wages, the welfare of those who remained employed rose in the Great Depression.
Overwhelmingly, those who became and remained unemployed suffered the most.
Second, reintegrating the unemployed even into a smoothly functioning market economy would prove to be very difficult.
After all, how many employers would not prefer a fresh entrant into the labor force to someone who has been out of work for years?
The simple fact that an economy had recently undergone a period of mass unemployment made it difficult to recover levels of growth and employment that are often attained as a matter of course.
Devalued exchange rates, moderate government budget deficits, and the passage of time all appeared to be equally ineffective remedies.
Highly centralized and unionized labor markets, like Australia’s, did as poorly as decentralized and laissez-faire labor markets, like that of the United States, in dealing with long-term unemployment.
Fascist solutions were equally unsuccessful, as in Italy, unless accompanied by rapid rearmament, as in Germany.
In the end, in the US, it was the approach of World War II and the associated demand for military goods that led private-sector employers to hire the long-term unemployed at wages they would accept.
But, even today, economists can provide no clear explanation of why the private sector could not find ways to employ the long-term unemployed in the near-decade from the winter of 1933 to full war mobilization.
The extent of persistent unemployment, despite different labor-market structures and national institutions, suggests that theories that pinpoint one key failure should be taken with a grain of salt.
At first, the long-term unemployed in the Great Depression searched eagerly and diligently for alternative sources of work.
But, after six months or so passed without successful reemployment, they tended to become discouraged and distraught.
After 12 months of continuous unemployment, the typical unemployed worker still searched for a job, but in a desultory fashion, without much hope.
And, after two years of unemployment, the worker, accurately expecting to be at the end of every hiring queue, had lost hope and, for all practical purposes, left the labor market.
This was the pattern of the long-term unemployed in the Great Depression.
It was also the pattern of the long-term unemployed in Western Europe at the end of the 1980s.
And, in a year or two, it will be the pattern again for the long-term unemployed in the North Atlantic region.
I have been arguing for four years that our business-cycle problems call for more aggressively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and that our biggest problems would quickly melt away were such policies to be adopted.
That is still true.
But, over the next two years, barring a sudden and unexpected interruption of current trends, it will become less true.
The current balance of probabilities is that two years from now, the North Atlantic’s principal labor-market failures will not be demand-side market failures that could be easily remedied by more aggressive policies to boost economic activity and employment.
Rather, they will be structural market failures of participation that are not amenable to any straightforward and easily implemented cure.
Hope or Hype for Personalized Medicine?
STANFORD – During the past several decades, treatment for a variety of conditions has begun to shift from a “one size fits all” approach to a more personalized strategy.
As a result, patients can more often be matched to the best drug for their genetic makeup or the exact subcategory of their disease.
This enables physicians to avoid prescribing a medication (or a dosage) that might cause serious side effects in certain populations.
In other words, even among patients who apparently have the same disease and symptoms, the treatment for each one would be determined by various predictive or prognostic tests.
Eventually, these tests could extend even to the sequencing of the DNA in an individual patient’s cancer cells, for example.
But, while this high-tech approach could be a boon to patients, it could prove detrimental to drug companies’ bottom lines.
The reasons are subtle.
Personalized drug therapy uses biological indicators, or “biomarkers” – such as DNA sequences or the presence or absence of drug receptors – as an indicator of how patients should be treated, as well as to estimate the likelihood that the intervention will be effective.
This concept is not new: it has been known for decades, for example, that people who have a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD can experience severe and precipitous anemia if they are exposed to certain drugs.
Similarly, ethnic groups and individuals vary widely in their ability to clear medications from the bloodstream, owing to differences in the activity of the enzymes that metabolize, or degrade, drugs.
That is important because low metabolizers clear certain drugs slowly and have more medication in their systems for longer periods of time than high metabolizers.
Thus, the former might be prone to overdose, and the latter to insufficient levels of the same drug.
Prognostic biomarkers have begun to make a big difference in cancer therapy.
Drugs such as Erbitux and Vectibix work only in tumors containing the normal version of a gene called KRAS.
If mutations of KRAS are present, the drugs are ineffective.
Such mutations explain about 30-40% of cases in which patients fail to respond to these drugs, and mutations in another gene called BRAF could account for another 12%.
Knowing this crucial information about a cancer patient’s genes will reduce sharply the number who are unnecessarily subjected to the side effects (and expense) of drugs that will not work.
Improving the efficacy and reducing the side effects of drug therapy will be a boon to doctors, patients, and insurance companies, to be sure, but why should pharmaceutical companies embrace personalized medicine in the long term?
On the positive side, the presence of biomarkers will enable drug companies to perform smaller, better-targeted clinical studies in order to demonstrate efficacy.
In any kind of experiment, a fundamental principle is that the greater the number of subjects or iterations, the greater the confidence in the study’s results.
Unless the effect of the intervention is profound, small studies generally have large uncertainties in results.
That is where biomarkers make a difference.
They can help drug makers to design clinical studies that will show a high “relative treatment difference” between the drug and whatever it is being compared to (often a placebo, but sometimes another treatment).
Thus, when drugs are ultimately approved based on the use of biomarkers, the description of the medication’s approved uses, which is printed on the label, might be more restrictive – that is, it might reduce the size of the patient population for which the drug is intended.
For example, a drug broadly approved for “arthritis” – inflammation of joints that may be due to dozens of different disease processes – can be more widely marketed than one approved to treat only the arthritis that accompanies psoriasis or gout.
In reality, however, the situation is more complex.
Assessments of safety and efficacy often do not move closely in tandem, so that even if smaller, better-targeted clinical trials offer clear evidence of a drug’s efficacy, regulators might demand far larger studies to provide evidence of the drug’s safety.
Increasingly defensive about accusations that drugs and vaccines are inadequately tested for safety, in recent years safety-obsessed regulators have required massive, hugely expensive, and time-consuming clinical trials designed to detect even very rare side effects.
Consider, for example, that before its US approval, a vaccine against rotavirus (a common, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection in children) was tested in more than 72,000 children – and another 40,000-plus in post-marketing studies.
On a similar scale, a vaccine to prevent human papilloma virus infection and cervical cancer was tested in almost 30,000 young women.
Such studies are very costly, and, by any reasonable standard, the number of patients included in them is grossly excessive.
Thus, the impact of personalized medicine in the short term might be positive at the patient’s bedside, but vast clinical trials to demonstrate the safety of new drugs will impose huge development costs that manufacturers might never recover.
(Currently, only about one in five drugs approved by US regulators ever recoup their development costs.)&#160;This situation would not be sustainable in the long term.
If society is to derive the maximum benefit from personalized medicine – which will require companies to pursue it – regulators worldwide will need to adopt reasoned and reasonable policies.
The current Japanese government, under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, would like to revise the pacifist constitution, as a necessary first step toward weaning the country off its total dependence on the US.
Horse Trading and Climate Change
AMSTERDAM – When the panda smiles, the world applauds.
Or so it seemed after Chinese President Hu Jintao’s recent speech at the United Nations.
Judging by the way much of the media reported his words, it seemed as if China had actually made an important announcement on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
It hadn’t.
All President Hu really said was that China would now “endeavour” to curb its carbon emissions by a “notable” margin.
But how does one measure “endeavour” or “notable”?
As someone with close links to the Chinese administration told me when pressed: “What was said was actually pretty meaningless.”
Indeed, there were no specific targets and, as any China watcher knows, the “greening” of the government is old news.
Official Chinese policy in recent years has been to make GDP growth greener.
But not at the expense of growth itself – and China plans to grow pretty fast.
At least the panda smiled.
Poor Barack Obama didn’t even have that to offer.
He offered no pledge to cut emissions in the United States, and, with vote-sapping battles already underway over health-care reform, one wonders how much time and energy Obama will have for environmental imperatives.
If all the world got out of this UN General Assembly meeting of government leaders was insubstantial rhetoric, the worse news is that it got more of the same at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
As one finance minister told me rather wistfully, when I asked him what had actually been delivered on climate change: “Words,” he said, &quot;just words.”
Given that there are little more than two months until the Copenhagen summit on climate change, which is supposed to frame the successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, this is depressing.
Perhaps the only people not suddenly depressed are those immersed in the negotiations.
With more than a thousand points still to be agreed, all the policymakers I’ve spoken to recently say that they cannot see how a meaningful deal can be reached by December in Copenhagen.
In reality, everyone is gearing up behind the scenes for a “Copenhagen 2,” and what those involved in the negotiations are calling “an even greater slog.”
Even if some sort of communiqué is cobbled together in December – and countries with elections coming up, such as the United Kingdom, will push for one – it is hard to believe that it will contain sufficient detail or reflect the proper level of commitment to have the impact so desperately needed.
“Copenhagen 1” was always bound to fail, partly because – and this may sound strange at first – it is all about climate change.
Although cuts in CO2 emissions and agreement on funding and finance are necessary goals, the geopolitical reality is that climate change cannot be decoupled from trade or discussions on exchange rates, the IMF, reform of the UN, and so on.
There is a quid pro quo that no one explicitly talks about but which must be addressed: trade-offs between these negotiations, not just within them.
Meaningful action on climate change will not be seen until it is agreed within this broader framework.
This means taking the issue out of its current compartment and being realistic enough to understand that Brazil’s position on cutting down rainforests, for example, will be affected by whether or not it is given a seat on the UN Security Council.
It means being sophisticated enough to understand that as long as China feels under pressure to stop propping up the renmimbi, it is unlikely to deliver commitments on emissions cuts.
Widening the scope of the next round of negotiations so that much more can be used as bargaining chips would make the job of the negotiators considerably harder.
But it would also give them considerably more to work with.
In fact, there is no other way to prevent the process from remaining a zero-sum game.
Worryingly, “Copenhagen 2” will not only have to navigate this complicated terrain, but it must do so in less than five years.
The climate bomb is ticking, and there is a palpable sense of urgency among policymakers.
For, as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has explicitly warned, if emissions do not fall before 2015, and only fall from then onwards (and the overall trend is that they have been rising), we will reach the point of no return.
At that point, the Armageddon scenarios of droughts, rising sea levels, floods, energy and resource wars, and mass migration will become a reality.
Just think of the images of recent storms and floods in the Philippines and Vietnam that displaced and killed thousands, and multiply those horrors manifold. That is what we are up against.
Climate change negotiations are arguably the most important of our lifetime, because their outcome will determine the fate of our planet.
It is essential that they take place within structures and frameworks that encourage agreement by putting other major multilateral issues up for discussion.
The world’s governments must be able to trade horses if pandas and presidents are to do more than smile.
Houses in the Air
Over the past six months, attention and worry have shifted from America’s enormous trade deficit to its surging property markets and real-estate bubble.
At least two of the reasons for high – and rising – home prices in the United States are well understood.
What remains highly uncertain, however, is whether an obviously overheating market can be cooled without sending America, and its main trading partners around the world, into an economic tailspin.
The US housing boom is due, first, to low interest rates, which mean that large amounts of money can be borrowed for mortgages with moderate monthly payments.
Low interest rates strengthen the ability to pay, and thus boost demand.
And, with demand high and housing supply fixed – at least in the short run – prices go up.
Second, the 70-year period that began with the widespread diffusion of the automobile –during which one could get nearly anywhere in a typical metropolitan area in half an hour or less – is over.
Before there was widespread automobile ownership, land prices depended on location, and proximity to the central city or to the local railroad station carried a premium.
Now, with serious congestion slowing traffic in major cities to a crawl, the land gradient in housing prices is steep once again.
Perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could be delayed for a decade if we were willing to shift to denser residential patterns.
We could, for example, tear down San Francisco’s row houses and replace them with buildings more like those of New York’s Upper West Side.
But we aren’t willing to do that.
These two factors – low mortgage rates, and the fact that the country has filled up so much that our cars no longer marginalize location costs – go a long way toward explaining the surge in housing prices over the past decade or so.
But they don’t go all the way.
On top of these two powerful fundamental factors sits a bubble.
The bubble is filled by people with money who are buying extra houses because they think home prices will continue to rise, and by people without money who are buying $400,000 houses in less-fashionable neighborhoods with zero percent down and floating interest rates.
Both groups’ demand is inherently ephemeral. When the first group discovers that housing prices don’t always go up, they will try to dump their properties.
And when the second group discovers that interest rates don’t always stay low, many of them will be unable to meet their higher mortgage payments and will likewise try to dump their properties.
The end of the American housing bubble might not turn out badly.
But if it does, it will probably be due to a sharp rise in interest rates.
This could happen for two reasons. First, investors, recognizing that the dollar is overvalued and that they are likely to suffer large losses when it returns to its fundamental value, could start selling their Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.
As the prices of these assets fall, their yields will rise.
At some point, the yields on bonds and mortgages will be high enough that investors’ appetite for yield will balance their fear of exchange-rate depreciation.
In the corridors around my office, all the economists agree that this factor should have pushed US interest rates up three years ago.
But so far it has not.
Does this mean that a hurricane could hit world financial markets at any moment?
Yes.
Or it could also mean that economists’ baseline model of the international economy – especially the assumption of “uncovered interest parity,” which holds that foreign interest income expressed in the domestic currency should equal the domestic interest rate – is simply wrong.
The second factor that could push US interest rates sharply upward is not fear of a decline in the future value of the dollar, but the fact of a past decline in its value.
The US imports the equivalent of 16% of its GDP.
A 40% fall in the value of the dollar – of which half passes through to increased dollar prices of imports – thus implies a 3.2% rise in the overall price level.
A Federal Reserve committed to effective price stability will likely raise interest rates rather than allow any year’s inflation rate to jump from 3% to 6%.
If there is a sharp spike in interest rates – caused either by capital flight in anticipation of a dollar decline or by tight monetary policy in reaction to a dollar decline comes to pass – we will see how good the Federal Reserve really is.
If interest rates rise too far, then the collapse in housing values will lead to large-scale foreclosures and a collapse in consumption spending as well.
This would mean a depression not just for the US, but for Asia and probably Europe as well, for the US can remain the world’s importer of last resort and guarantor of effective demand only as long as its domestic consumption is strong.
But if interest rates don’t rise far enough, the value of the dollar will spiral downward and US inflation will spiral upward like in the 1970’s, setting the stage for the type of extremely painful measures imposed by then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
In these circumstances, straight is the gait and narrow is the path that the Federal Reserve will have to walk – hardly an enviable position.
And yet journalists – not very experienced reporters, to be sure – ask me who is likely to get the “plum job” of Fed Chair next year.
3D Fantasies
NEW YORK – How will 3D printing change the world?
Today, you can read about jewelry and custom can openers, much as three decades ago you could have read that the personal computer would enable people to keep their recipes organized.
Of course, PCs became much more useful than that.
Many entrepreneurs and small businesspeople can now run their entire operations on a computer, and people keep their recipes not only organized, but also online.
They also track their workouts, monitor their babies, and amass huge collections of digital friends (for better or worse).
The Internet changed the balance of power between individuals and institutions.
It enabled millions of people to have jobs without having bosses.
Instead, they have agents – such as TaskRabbit or Amazon Web Services or Uber – who match providers and customers.
I think we will see a similar story with 3D printing, as it grows from a novelty into something useful and disruptive – and sufficiently cheap and widespread to be used for (relatively) frivolous endeavors as well.
We will print not just children’s playthings, but also human prostheses – bones and even lungs and livers – and ultimately much machinery, including new 3D printers.
So, even as custom-manufactured goods become cheaper and people talk about local manufacture as well as local foods, other goods may get more expensive if we do it right.
“Juan got his wife Alice a real wooden chair for her birthday!” you might hear.
But their daughter Mika got a reprinted chair made from the same old materials plus a little more, marking her growth from her last birthday.
Only the size and the filigree on the back are different, reflecting her new interest in space travel; last year, it was horses.
Like computers and the Internet, 3D printing will affect business and behavior around the world and across industries.
Already, there is a growing number of shared 3D printing services, enabling you to print something of your own design or use (a customized version of) designs that you can find in online catalogues or order through 3D design shops.
Over time, these print shops will replace thousands of stores carrying millions of items, some of which sit around for months waiting to be bought.
They will print goods using designs from online services that offer designs for both open-source, free-design goods and branded goods that may not seem very distinct except for a logo.
Indeed, branding and intellectual property issues will become increasingly “complicated” for hardware, just as they are now for software and content.
Many people will have to shift from controlling design to offering better services to make money, or perhaps band together under a particular brand known for some other quality.
Materials may come to be one such differentiator, as illustrated by a startup called Emerging Objects.
As in the world of content and software, new design brands are likely to emerge and die more quickly; the pace of change will increase and it will be harder to stay on top for long.
Outside the world of manufacturing, where mass-produced goods may still have a substantial cost advantage over custom-printed ones, 3D printing will have far greater impact downstream, in the market for spare parts and replacements, where demand is less predictable but more precise.
(If you want a widget, any widget will do, but once you have widget 94303, only part 94303A will satisfy you.)
One early example is KeyMe.net, which makes house keys on demand.
The user needs one original, which he registers by inserting into the KeyMe kiosk; he can then store that design anonymously in KeyMe’s database, with unique access to it via his fingerprints and email (but with no reference to a physical address).
Then, when he loses the key or needs a spare, he can get a new copy at any location with a kiosk – of which there will soon be many, the company hopes.
The cost in money (let alone convenience) is a fraction of that for going to an ordinary key maker – especially at the hours when such emergencies usually occur.
KeyMe does not actually use 3D printing; it cuts them out of blanks the “traditional” way, but uses the same kind of electronic design representation that a 3D printer would.
In fact, I consider it a brilliant forerunner of the overall impact of 3D printing – making the occasional production of cheap copies of a specific item easy and available anywhere, anytime.
Today, for example, many businesses are devoted to managing and storing spare parts.
Each location needs to carry thousands of different spare parts because it is not clear which ones will be needed where.
But, in the future, if something breaks, you will be able to take it over to the 3D print shop to be reprinted.
Better yet, the shop may be able to reuse the materials in your broken part – saving the costs and environmental burden of throwing things away, shipping them somewhere, and so forth.
Consider Apple power cords (the item that I lose most often), which are a huge source of profit for all involved.
That will change - hallelujah!
Of course, my reduced cost will be someone else’s reduced revenue – and not just Apple’s.
One big loser in this world will be the freight business (along with junkyards, logistics companies, and centralized recycling operations).
When things can be made, used, broken/worn out, and recycled closer to home, the need for transport is reduced dramatically.
Recycled materials do not need to be delivered to centralized processing centers and then forwarded to factories.
Products will not need to be made in those factories and then shipped to customers or to inventory centers.
Right now, US inventories held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers are valued at around $1.7 trillion – or about 10% of annual GDP.
This includes many things that cannot be 3D-printed (anytime soon, at least), but it does hint at how much stuff is just sitting around.
In the short run, this means greater efficiency and more and speedier recycling, happening locally rather than centrally.
In the long run, 3D printing will allow more efficient use of physical resources and faster diffusion of the best designs, boosting living standards around the world.
How Accurate Are Your Pet Pundits?
Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea’s Politburo. But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?
The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the mass media), market mechanisms will assure quality control.
Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records; otherwise, they would have been weeded out.
Skeptics, however, warn that the mass media dictate the voices we hear and are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices.
As a result, fame could be negatively, not positively, correlated with long-run accuracy.
Until recently, no one knew who is right, because no one was keeping score.
But the results of a 20-year research project now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth.
I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it?
How can we know?
The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy.
We find that the media not only fail to weed out bad ideas, but that they often favor bad ideas, especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly.
The evidence falls into two categories.
First, as the skeptics warned, when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than they do.
Boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers.
Between 1985 and 2005, boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets (e.g., a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000) and world politics (e.g., tranquility in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa).
They assigned probabilities of 65% to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15% of the time.
In the same period, doomsters performed even more poorly, exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive, plus several more (I still await the impending disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium, and Sudan).
They assigned probabilities of 70% to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12% of the time.
Second, again as the skeptics warned, over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong.
Indeed, the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues.
We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as “hedgehogs” or “foxes.”
Hedgehogs are big-idea thinkers in love with grand theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc. Their self-confidence can be infectious.
They know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong.
That wins them media acclaim.
But they don’t know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view.
They take their theories too seriously.
The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google.
Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms.
They are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates, conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views.
They sprinkle their conversations with linguistic qualifiers that limit the reach of their arguments: ‘but,’ ‘however,’ ‘although.’
Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes.
Foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: “Yes, my colleague is right that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition.”
Imagine your job as a media executive depends on expanding your viewing audience. Whom would you pick: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the likeliest outcome is more of the same, or an expert who gets viewers on the edge of their seats over radical Islamists seizing control and causing oil prices to soar?
In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular.
At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve.
But that is unfair.
No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy.
Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs.
Here, then, is a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the trade-offs between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and party loyalty.
Wouldn’t they be more likely to read pundits with better track records?
If so, pundits might adapt to accountability by showing more humility, and political debate might begin to sound less shrill.
Granted, it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion. But in a world where, as Yeats said, “and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity,” it is worth trying.
Brexit, Voice, and Loyalty
PRINCETON – Albert Hirschman, who died at the end of last year, was a great economist with a gift for producing striking insights by focusing on an element of observable behavior as a way to transform our view of a whole range of particular problems.
One of his most far-ranging insights was his framework of “exit, voice, and loyalty.”
Originally formulated after an experience with poor trains in West Africa, Hirschman realized that if a complex social system allowed people to leave (exit), its efficiency might deteriorate; a better solution would be to retain people (loyalty), which would give them incentives to articulate demands (voice) that would improve the system’s performance.
It is easy to see how this theory can be applied to personal relations.
Marriages break down if divorce (exit) is too easy; but also become unbearable if there is no sense of mutuality and discussion (voice).
Voice may also decrease if new possibilities emerge: a new potential partner means that there is no longer any pressure to discuss and improve relations within the existing arrangement.
The schema might also be applied to political relations: Hirschman wrote a memorable article showing how the ability to exit East Germany in 1989 produced a sudden breakdown of loyalty.
Europeans might rethink some of their current dilemmas in the light of Hirschman’s theory.
The marriage analogy has become a rather over-used metaphor for Europe’s efforts to integrate.
But it is clear that both voice and loyalty have become a problem for the European Union.
Many citizens and governments believe that they lack influence, or voice, which tends to reduce loyalty.
Now a more radical possibility has been raised.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has raised the possibility of a “Brexit,” a British exit from the European Union.
The polemics that preceded and followed Cameron’s recent speech on Europe showed that both British Euro-skeptics and Europe’s truest Europhiles – including such iconic figures as former European Commission President Jacques Delors – welcomed the British initiative.
Can the British exit threat shake Europe to its senses and make the United Kingdom’s effort to reform institutions more likely to succeed, or to make Europe a more stable polity?
Hirschman’s framework, which is instructive in helping us to think about how loyalty and affection can be generated, suggests that it cannot.
Countries do not like to feel isolated.
They want to see their institutions and values mirrored and replicated in their neighbors – a dynamic that builds loyalty.
As a result, the EU is constantly expanding, while the US likes to urge the world to democratize.
Democratic states are not alone in seeking to expand their influence.
The Soviet Union also wanted to surround itself with a protective buffer of like-minded states, and Italy’s Benito Mussolini was proud that for a time fascism was a competitive export.
The recognition of an exit possibility reverses that basic process of forging bonds of loyalty.
Some other attraction may appear.
One of the factors driving the UK’s sense of unease in its relations with an increasingly bureaucratized Europe is the belief that its values and institutions are closer to those of the US, or of other English-speaking former colonies.
By the 1990’s, British Euro-skeptics coined the term “Anglosphere” to describe a model that was more successful and more expansionary than that of the EU.
The US has been the “other woman” undermining Britain’s loyalty to the EU as an attractive permanent partner.
As a result, Britain has lost much of its ability to make an effective contribution to European reform.
Indeed, the last time Britain had a strong European voice was more than two decades ago.
In the mid-1980’s, then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher successfully pushed the idea of an integrated internal market.
The liberalization of trade and investment implied by the Single European Act was greatly inspired by a British deregulatory vision.
At the time, Delors presented the introduction of a single currency as a way to complement or complete the Single Market.
Since then, however, both the American financial model (with powerful financial institutions thriving in lightly regulated markets) and the American model of engagement (in Iraq and Afghanistan) for some time appeared more dynamic and more in accordance with the demands of a globalizing world.
Both elements of the American dream have now lost something of their appeal.
The Iraq engagement proved to be built on deception.
The financial house of cards collapsed.
But Britain remains attracted to something else, and so unwilling to engage in “voice.”
The US is appalled by the consequences of Britain’s flirtation.
It wants to remain engaged with the entire world, not just some islands off the European coast.
It is easier for the US to deal with Europe as a whole, especially when some European answers to common social dilemmas look as if they might provide solutions for America as well.
The outcome resembles a Shakespeare comedy of confused identity.
Europe and Britain are married, but Britain wants to deepen its relationship with America, while America cares more about Europe.
Loyalty-enhancing mechanisms are not easy to establish.
The best ones are positive, like rapid economic growth and rising prosperity, which underpinned the European dream in the past.
Restoring them is unlikely, at least for now.
There can also be negative incentives to loyalty that induce everyone to keep up appropriate standards of behavior.
The risk is that the comedy of misguided affection is resolved by punishing both the tempter and the tempted.
What is the modern equivalent of branding with a scarlet “A,” which was the penalty for adultery in colonial New England?
Maybe the credit-ratings agencies have the answer.
Inside America’s Tax Battle
BERKELEY – America’s recent presidential election answered the question of whether an increase in revenues will be part of the country’s long-run deficit-reduction plan.
The answer is yes: there is now bipartisan agreement on the need for a “balanced” approach that includes revenue increases and spending cuts.
But there are still deep political and ideological divisions about how additional revenues should be raised and who should pay higher taxes.
If a preliminary agreement on these questions is not reached by the end of the year, the economy faces a “fiscal cliff” of $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will shave about 4% from GDP and trigger a recession.
The majority of citizens agree with President Barack Obama that tax increases for deficit reduction should fall on the top 2-3% of taxpayers, who have enjoyed the largest gains in income and wealth over the last 30 years.
That is why he is proposing that the 2001 and 2003 rate cuts for these taxpayers be allowed to expire at the end of the year, while the rate cuts for other taxpayers are extended.
So far, Obama’s Republican opponents are adamant that the cuts be extended for all taxpayers, arguing that increases in top rates would discourage job creation.
This claim is not supported by the evidence.
Recent research finds no link between tax cuts for top taxpayers and job creation.
In contrast, tax cuts for the bottom 95% have a positive and significant effect on job growth.
During the past three decades, income inequality in the United States has increased significantly; indeed, the US now has the fourth-highest level of income inequality in the OECD, behind Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.
At the same time, as the largest tax cuts have gone to high-income taxpayers, the US tax system has become considerably less progressive.
The US needs fiscal measures that both curb the deficit and contain rising income inequality – and the inequality of opportunity that it begets.
But how should additional revenues be raised from top taxpayers to achieve these two goals?
Most economists believe that increasing revenues by reforming the tax code and broadening the tax base is “probably” better for the economy’s long-term growth than raising income-tax rates.
The analytical case for this belief is strong, but the empirical evidence is weak.
In theory, higher marginal tax rates have well known negative effects – they reduce private incentives to work, save, and invest.
Yet most empirical studies conclude that, at least within the range of income-tax rates in the US during the last several decades, these effects are negligible.
A recent Congressional Research Service report, withdrawn under pressure from Congressional Republicans, found that changes in the top income-tax rate and the rate on capital gains had no discernible effect on economic growth during the last half-century.
A recent review of the economic literature by three distinguished academics found no convincing evidence that real economic activity responds materially to tax-rate changes on top income earners, although such changes do affect their tax-avoidance behavior.
So Obama has evidence on his side when he says that allowing the tax cuts for high-income taxpayers to expire at the end of the year will not affect economic growth.
Republicans have proposed tax reforms in lieu of rate hikes on high-income taxpayers to raise revenues for deficit reduction.
Obama has signaled that he is willing to consider this approach, provided it increases tax revenues from the top 2-3% by at least the same amount as higher rates while protecting other taxpayers.
The federal tax system is certainly in need of reform.
Tax expenditures – which include all deductions, credits, and loopholes – account for about 8% of GDP.
Indeed, the US tax code is riddled with special preferences and contains large differences in effective tax rates across individuals and economic activities.
These differences distort decisions about investment allocation and financing.
Reforms that made the tax system simpler, fairer, and less distortionary would have a beneficial effect on economic growth, although economists concede that the size of this effect is uncertain and impossible to quantify.
Because tax expenditures are so large, limiting them could raise a significant amount of additional revenue that could be used both for deficit reduction and to finance across-the-board cuts in income-tax rates.
Analysis of the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin deficit-reduction plans by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center confirms that this approach is arithmetically feasible.
Reducing large regressive tax expenditures like preferential tax rates for capital gains and dividends and deductions for state and local taxes, and replacing deductions with progressive tax credits, could generate enough revenue to finance rate cuts for all taxpayers, increase the tax code’s overall progressivity, and contribute meaningfully to deficit reduction.
But the odds of such an outcome are very low: what is arithmetically feasible is unlikely to be politically possible.
Efforts to cap popular tax expenditures will encounter strong opposition from Republicans and Democrats alike.
Nonetheless, some tax reforms are likely to be a key component of a bipartisan deficit-reduction deal, because they provide Republicans who oppose increases in tax rates for high-income taxpayers with an ideologically preferable way to increase revenue from them.
Unfortunately, it will take time to negotiate tax reforms – more time than remains until the end of the year, when the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are scheduled to expire for all taxpayers.
But there is still time to negotiate an agreement that extends these cuts for the bottom 98%, and that contains temporary measures to cap deductions and credits for high-income taxpayers in 2013.
Such an agreement could help to break the political impasse over whether and how much these taxpayers’ rates should rise next year, thereby preventing the US from falling over the fiscal cliff and back into recession.
Saving Syria and America
DENVER – Critics of America’s Middle East policies are reminiscent of Woody Allen’s quip in Annie Hall: “The food at this place is really terrible...and such small portions.”
The United States is seen as the culprit behind many of the regions ills, and yet it is accused of not being sufficiently engaged, of “leading from behind,” of failing to support democracy, of abandoning its friends, and so on.
Given all the accusations that the US faces for its involvement in the region over the decades, one would think that America would be invited to stay home.
But the region cries out for leadership, and the US remains the only country that can provide it.
The problem for the US is not the divisions in the Middle East that it must understand and navigate better, but rather the divisions within the US that have eroded domestic consensus on many foreign-policy issues.
Those internal differences are what have kept the US on the sidelines during the latest Middle East upheavals.
America used to have essentially two varieties of foreign-policy positions: realist and idealist.
But today opinions are fragmented across a broad range of positions – a situation that also cries out for leadership.
President Barack Obama’s oft-stated view that “we need some nation building at home,” combined with his antiseptic waging of drone warfare, indicates that he is erring on the side of the isolationists of both the left and the right.
Unilateralism, it seems, is fast becoming the isolationists’ internationalism.
What the US needs is to explain better to its own people why America should engage more deeply with the Middle East’s mounting problems.
This is not to say that the US should necessarily engage with every problem.
But, whether America is engaged or not, it does need a policy.
Syria is a case in point.
The situation there, predicted by every pundit around, has metastasized and threatens to become a full-blown regional civil war.
The US has reacted to this international catastrophe by providing light arms to some rebel groups in order to inflict a pinprick on President Bashar al-Assad’s regime for its use of chemical weapons months before.
This is not serious policy.
Military assistance should support a political plan, not serve as a substitute for one.
A month ago, there was a brief moment of hope when US Secretary of State John Kerry began an effort to find a way forward with the Russians.
The Kremlin’s consequential and sustained support of Assad is serious policy, and suggests that if the US is to make progress short of confrontation with Russia, it should work with Russian leaders to narrow the differences so that, at the end of the process, a peace conference is held.
Indeed, successful US policy in the Middle East has usually included a serious Russian track.
Instead, the talks with the Russians seem to have run aground on the question of calling a conference among the warring parties to agree on elections.
But elections in sectarian conflicts tend to be merely a census, and the Assad regime and all the other players know full well that Syria is a Sunni-majority country.
There is no need for an election to determine that.
What is not known is whether there is a set of future political arrangements on which the parties could agree.
It is not known, because it has not been tried.
Meanwhile, the Obama administration has made no effort to explain what it is doing and why, engaging instead in public handwringing over the complexities of the problem.
But building monuments to difficult problems is not a policy.
As Churchill once wrote about the “Mulberry” harbors (his ingenious plan to install prefabricated floating piers a day after the Normandy landings), “the difficulties will argue for themselves.”
Obama’s explanation of a Syrian policy might look something like this: “Syria is a difficult problem that, left unchecked, could threaten US interests in the region.
No side can prevail and win outright, so there must be a negotiated settlement on the political arrangements that follow the conflict.
The US will work with partners in the region and internationally to assist the Syrians to find a way forward.
Syrians need to understand what their country will look like in the future, so that all sides can see a solution that can be secured through negotiation rather than violence.”
He should then announce concrete action to achieve this goal: “Today, I have directed State Department teams under Secretary Kerry to visit key international capitals – in Europe and Arab League countries, as well as Moscow – in an effort to agree on a set of principles around which Syrians can find common ground.”
The first principle could be that Syria should continue to exist within its current borders.
Another might be that Syria will be a federal state, with broad local autonomy.
A third could concern the shape of a future parliament.
And so forth.
When agreed, these principles could be announced as an international peace plan.
Only when one or more parties to the conflict reject it has the moment arrived to consider a serious effort to arm some of the combatants.
In the end, a solution in Syria will depend on Syrians’ agreement on future political arrangements.
But the US demand that Assad step down or be removed from power has not been helpful; indeed, it has marginalized the US more than it has Assad.
No one can be expected to join negotiations aimed at his or her own political demise.
But all that is water under the bridge.
There are those who say that the Syrian crisis could have been addressed two years ago, but that now is too late.
Two years from now, some will say the same thing.
But if the US can work with partners on the specifics of a future political plan, it can still rescue Syria, not to mention itself.
Rank Mysteries
PARIS – Gibraltar received exciting news last month.
The latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), published by the consultancy Z/Yen in London, revealed that the Rock had risen further and faster up the ranks than any other center – 17 places, from 70th to 53rd position, since the previous report in September 2013.
I can imagine the celebrations in Gibraltar Town, where, now that the British naval base has closed and Spain is being difficult at the border, financial services are crucial for employment.
And I can also imagine that many in Hamilton, Bermuda, which plummeted almost as far as Gibraltar climbed – 16 places, to 56th – must be crying into their rum punch.
Of course, it is also possible that Gibraltar and Bermuda have chosen to ignore the results, or dispute their significance.
Either way, there is no doubting the global obsession with league tables nowadays.
One can find a ranking for almost every form of human activity.
Commercial banks are ranked by assets.
Investment banks are ranked on a variety of metrics, as are universities – from academic results to their prowess in environmental management, or their appeal to gay students.
In the United Kingdom, you can find a table showing where it is best to live if you wish to win Britain’s National Lottery.
(Your chances are almost twice as good in the northeast as in Northern Ireland.)
When one looks closely, most of these tables are, as Henry Kissinger famously put it, “content-free.”
For one brief shining moment, the Royal Bank of Scotland was global top dog in rankings of commercial banks, and we know how that story ended.
Is this true of the GFCI, or does it contain valuable insights into how the global financial system is evolving?
The press headlines accompanying the release of the latest GFCI focused on the change at the top of the league: New York leapfrogged ahead of London, while Hong Kong and Singapore held on in third and fourth place, respectively.
Is this a significant switch?
Much speculation has centered on the recent damage to London’s reputation stemming from the scandal surrounding banks’ manipulation of the Libor interest rate.
Even if some of the machinations were carried out in other cities, there is no escaping the fact that Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate.
Moreover, London is the biggest center for foreign-exchange trading, the new focus of regulatory attention.
And, though Bruno Iksil was a Frenchman working for the American bank JPMorgan Chase, he became known universally as the “London Whale.”
But GFCI’s detailed results do not bear out that explanation.
London’s reputational factors “are firmly above average and have not seen much change over the past five editions.”
Indeed, it seems that London’s small decline is attributable to negative scores on general factors such as the “business environment” and “infrastructure.”
Overcrowded Underground trains and Heathrow’s congestion are having an impact, though it is hard to understand why New York wins on these measures.
Riding the Subway often brings unpleasant surprises, while JFK Airport is hardly a favorite among travelers (and there remains no fast rail link to it).
And yet these subtle switches at the top of the table are not the real story.
From a ten-year perspective, the big gainers have been Hong Kong and Singapore.
It was once fashionable to argue that when China opened up to the world, Hong Kong and Singapore would suffer.
Once the Chinese got their act together, these cities’ role in intermediating the region’s finances would be marginalized by Shanghai, Shenzhen, and other new centers.
That still may happen one day, but it has not happened yet.
Hong Kong and Singapore have played their cards astutely.
The combination of an Asian market with strong Chinese connections and a system of English law and property rights continues to provide a powerful competitive advantage.
That is especially true in fund management.
Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in Shanghai, but wealthy Chinese with money to invest like to hold it in financial centers that are perceived as safe and non-political.
In Europe, we see a different pattern.
Over 15 consecutive surveys, London’s ranking and ratings have remained broadly constant, while Zurich, Geneva, Frankfurt, and Luxembourg have gradually narrowed the gap with it – though that gap remains wide.
There is little doubt that Frankfurt has won the contest with Paris to be the eurozone’s most important financial center.
The Germans were smart to insist on putting the European Central Bank there.
Given the ECB’s new function as the eurozone’s banking supervisor, Frankfurt can consolidate its victory.
Every European Union bank will need to bend the knee to its supervisor on the Main River, even if she does happen to be a Frenchwoman, Danièle Nouy.
In the United States, Boston, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, continue to consolidate their positions as important centers for asset management and, in the last case, for regulation.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation has given the Federal Reserve Board a much larger regulatory role than it had before the crisis.
But, unless New York’s populist new mayor, Bill de Blasio, tries to run the banks out of town, Western sheriff-style, these cities do not seem likely to steal Wall Street’s crown anytime soon.
All of the best award shows include a surprise.
This year’s wild card, billed as the financial center most “likely to become more significant” in the near future, is Casablanca.
I have no idea why Casablanca is an up-and-coming center, and the GFCI’s compilers do not explain.
Sometimes, in rankings as in life, a kiss is just a kiss.
Europe’s Fitful Financial Integration
LONDON – The well-publicized troubles of Portugal’s Banco Espírito Santo this summer have reminded us that the eurozone’s financial problems are by no means resolved.
There are, no doubt, idiosyncratic factors behind the bank’s problems, stemming from its exposure to other parts of the Espírito Santo family’s empire.
But when the bank announced a first-half loss of €3.6 billion ($4.7 billion), the sudden collapse of confidence was alarming, and nervous investors are asking whether there are similar time bombs ticking elsewhere.
All eyes are now on the European Central Bank’s asset quality review, due to be completed in the next couple of months.
The AQR is the key element in a “comprehensive assessment” of Europe’s banks before the ECB formally takes on supervisory responsibility for more than 80% of the eurozone banking system in November.
The ECB, quite sensibly, wants all of the potential horrors to be visible before the takeover – so that it cannot be blamed.
With national supervisors, who are often inclined to present a rosy picture of their countries’ institutions, no longer in charge, we can hope that the assessment will be more robust than the earlier stress tests carried out under the auspices of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Those tests, unlike their equivalent in the United States, failed to rebuild confidence.
Several banks that passed with flying colors were soon obliged to raise new capital.
But the creation of the European banking union has not been the only important change to Europe’s financial regulation since the crisis.
The events of 2007-2009 made it clear that there were serious gaps and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed.
So, following the recommendations of a report prepared in 2009 by former IMF Managing Director Jacques de Larosière, the European Commission created three new pan-European authorities charged with ensuring “consistent application” of European directives.
The deal was done with a large helping of political fudge: the three biggest European Union economies – the United Kingdom, France, and Germany – were persuaded to cede some control to the center, but only if each could host an authority.
Thus, the EBA was established in London, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is located in Paris, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) found a home in Frankfurt.
Collectively, they are known as the ESAs (European supervisory authorities).
The road to pan-European regulation over the last two decades has been winding and rocky.
In the early stages, it was assumed that the single financial market could work on the basis of mutual recognition: each country would accept the others’ regulation as broadly equivalent to its own and allow cross-border business to proceed on that basis.
That proved inadequate, as standards and rules remained very different from country to country, and gave way to an approach based on minimum harmonization, whereby core rules were to be the same across Europe, but local variations and additions remained permissible.
When that, too, proved ineffective at promoting competition, as countries used their national rules to block new entrants, the emphasis switched to maximum harmonization, with directives spelling out exactly how local rules must be applied across the EU.
That caused great concern in the City of London, but has been grudgingly accepted.
Since the global financial crisis, London has become less able to argue that it is special and must be left alone.
Now, with the establishment of central regulatory authorities, the EU has moved to the next stage of financial integration.
But, so far, these agencies’ responsibilities are very limited.
ESMA supervises rating agencies directly; but, outside banking, national authorities retain their day-to-day oversight responsibilities.
Integration-minded officials at the European Commission clearly do not regard this as a satisfactory end-state.
So they commissioned a thoughtful review of the three ESAs from Mazars, an accounting firm, which was published earlier this year.
The verdict, roughly, was “so far, so good.”
Now the Commission has followed up by publishing its own assessment.
The Commission was perhaps unlikely to be hypercritical of its own creations, and it is not.
Its report maintains that the ESAs have “quickly established well-functioning organizations aimed at contributing to restoring confidence in the financial sector,” and that market participants seem broadly satisfied with their work.
But the report’s authors believe that there is a need to expand the current mandates, develop a comprehensive approach to consumer protection, and reduce further the influence of national authorities.
The ESAs should have more power to impose their will in the interests of the EU as a whole.
Their chairs should have wider discretion to act on their own initiative.
The ESAs also need more money, which probably can come from fees levied on financial firms, and consideration should be given to merging them in a single location, presumably Brussels.
The general direction is clear.
Unless the new internal market commissioner takes a different view, the European Commission plans to move further along the road to genuine pan-European regulation.
The report now goes to the European Parliament, which can be expected to push harder for more integration, as it usually does.
A single authority, or perhaps two or three working closely together, is a logical arrangement for the eurozone, and perhaps for the entire EU financial market.
It would usefully complement the ECB’s new supervisory role.
But will London fall into line this time?
The British government, after all, has embarked on a path that runs in precisely the opposite direction – reducing the functions of central bodies and repatriating powers to national capitals.
Given the central role of London in EU financial markets, and its political sensitivity in the UK, there is bound to be trouble ahead.
The JPMorgan Problem Writ Large
PARIS – JPMorgan Chase has had a bad year.
Not only has the bank just reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade; it has also agreed to a tentative deal to pay a fine of $13 billion to the US government as punishment for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.
Other big legal and regulatory costs loom.
JPMorgan will bounce back, of course, but its travails have reopened the debate about what to do with banks that are “too big to fail.”
In the United States, policymakers chose to include the Volcker rule (named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker) in the Dodd-Frank Act, thereby restricting proprietary trading by commercial banks rather than reviving some form of the Glass-Steagall Act’s division of investment and retail banks.
But Senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain, a powerful duo, have returned to the fight.
They argue that recent events have shown that JPMorgan is too big to be managed well, even by CEO Jamie Dimon, whose fiercest critics do not accuse him of incompetence.
Nonetheless, the Warren-McCain bill is unlikely to be enacted soon, if only because President Barack Obama’s administration is preoccupied with keeping the government open and paying its bills, while bipartisan agreement on what day of the week it is, let alone on further financial reform, cannot be guaranteed.
But the question of what to do about huge, complex, and seemingly hard-to-control universal banks that benefit from implicit state support remains unresolved.
The “school solution,” agreed at the Financial Stability Board in Basel, is that global regulators should clearly identify systemically significant banks and impose tougher regulations on them, with more intensive supervision and higher capital ratios.
That has been done.
Initially, 29 such banks were designated, together with a few insurers – none of which like the company that they are obliged to keep!
There is a procedure for promotion and relegation, like in national football leagues, so the number fluctuates periodically.
Banks on the list must keep higher reserves, and maintain more liquidity, reflecting their status as systemically important institutions.
They must also prepare what are colloquially known as “living wills,” which explain how they would be wound down in a crisis – ideally without taxpayer support.
But, while all major countries are signed up to this approach, many of them think that more is needed.
The US now has its Volcker rule (though disputes between banks and regulators about just how to define it continue).
Elsewhere, more intrusive rules are being implemented, or are under consideration.
In the United Kingdom, the government created the Vickers Commission to recommend a solution.
Its members proposed that universal banks be obliged to set up ring-fenced retail-banking subsidiaries with a much higher share of equity capital.
Only the retail subsidiaries would be permitted to rely on the central bank for lender-of-last-resort support.
A version of the Vickers Commission’s recommendations, which is somewhat more flexible than its members proposed, is in a banking bill currently before Parliament.
A number of MPs want to impose tighter restrictions, and it is difficult to find anyone who will speak up for the banks, so some form of the bill is likely to pass, and big British banks will have to divide their operations and their capital.
The UK has decided to take action before any Europe-wide solution is agreed.
We British are still members of the European Union (at least for the time being), but sometimes our politicians forget that.
Sometimes they simply lose patience with the difficulty of agreeing on changes in negotiations that involve 28 countries, which seems especially true of financial reform, given that many of these countries are not home to systemically important banks and probably never will be.
But EU institutions have not been entirely inactive.
The European Commission asked an eminent-persons group, chaired by Erkki Liikanen, the head of the Finnish central bank, to examine this issue on a European scale.
The group’s report, published in October 2012, came to a similar conclusion as the Vickers Commission concerning the danger of brigading retail and investment banking activities in the same legal entity, and recommended separating the two.
The proposal mirrors the UK plan – the investment-banking and trading arms, not the retail side, would be ring-fenced – but the end point would be quite similar.
But the European Banking Federation has dug in its heels, describing the recommendations as “completely unnecessary.”
The European Commission asked for comments, and its formal position is that it is considering them along with the reports.
That consideration may take some time; indeed, it may never end.
Germany’s government seems to have little appetite for breaking up Deutsche Bank, and the French have taken a leaf from the British book and implemented their own reform.
The French plan looks more like a Gallic version of the Volcker rule than Vickers “à la française.”
It is far less rigorous than the banks feared, given President François Hollande’s fiery rhetoric in his electoral campaign last year, in which he anathematized the financial sector as the true “enemy.”
So we now have a global plan, of sorts, supplemented by various home-grown solutions in the US, the UK, and France, with the possibility of a European plan that would also differ from the others.
In testimony to the UK Parliament, Volcker gently observed that “Internationalizing some of the basic regulations [would make] a level playing field.
It is obviously not ideal that the US has the Volcker rule and [the UK has] Vickers…”
He was surely right, but “too big to fail” is another area in which the initial post-crisis enthusiasm for global solutions has failed.
The unfortunate result is an uneven playing field, with incentives for banks to relocate operations, whether geographically or in terms of legal entities.
That is not the outcome that the G-20 – or anyone else – sought back in 2009.
The Banks that Ate the Economy
LONDON – Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in London could grow to more than nine times Britain’s GDP by 2050.
His forecast represented a simple extrapolation of two trends: continued financial deepening worldwide (that is, faster growth of financial assets than of the real economy), and London’s maintenance of its share of the global financial business.
These may be reasonable assumptions, but the estimate was deeply unsettling to many.
Hosting a huge financial center, with outsize domestic banks, can be costly to taxpayers.
In Iceland and Ireland, banks outgrew their governments’ ability to support them when needed.
The result was disastrous.
Quite apart from the potential bailout costs, some argue that financial hypertrophy harms the real economy by syphoning off talent and resources that could better be deployed elsewhere.
But Carney argues that, on the contrary, the rest of the British economy benefits from having a global financial center in its midst.
“Being at the heart of the global financial system,” he said, “broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after British savings, and reinforces the ability of UK manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally.”
That is certainly the assumption on which the London market has been built and the line that successive governments have peddled.
But it is coming under fire.
Andy Haldane, one of the lieutenants Carney inherited at the BoE, has questioned the financial sector’s economic contribution, pointing to “its ability to both invigorate and incapacitate large parts of the non-financial economy.”
He argues (in a speech revealingly entitled “The Contribution of the Financial Sector: Miracle or Mirage?”) that the financial sector’s reported contribution to GDP has been significantly overrated.
Two recent papers raise further doubts.
In “The Growth of Modern Finance,” Robin Greenwood and David Scharfstein of Harvard Business School show that the share of finance in US GDP almost doubled between 1980 and 2006, just before the onset of the financial crisis, from 4.9% to 8.3%.
The two main factors driving that increase were the expansion of credit and the rapid rise in resources devoted to asset management (associated, not coincidentally, with the exponential growth in financial-sector incomes).
Greenwood and Scharfstein argue that increased financialization was a mixed blessing.
There may have been more savings opportunities for households and more diverse funding sources for firms, but the added value of asset-management activity was illusory.
Much of it involved costly churning of portfolios, while increased leverage implied fragility for the financial system as a whole and imposed severe social costs as over-exposed households subsequently went bankrupt.
Stephen G. Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi of the Bank for International Settlements – the central banks’ central bank – go further.
They argue that rapid financial-sector growth reduces productivity growth in other sectors.
Using a sample of 20 developed countries, they find a negative correlation between the financial sector’s share of GDP and the health of the real economy.
The reasons for this relationship are not easy to establish definitively, and the authors’ conclusions are controversial.
But it is clear that financial firms compete with others for resources, and especially for skilled labor.
Physicists or engineers with doctorates can choose to develop complex mathematical models of market movements for investment banks or hedge funds, where they are known colloquially as “rocket scientists.”
Or they could use their talents to design, say, real rockets.
Cecchetti and Kharroubi find evidence that it is indeed research-intensive firms that suffer most when finance is booming.
These companies find it harder to recruit skilled graduates when financial firms can pay higher salaries.
And we are not just talking about the so-called “quants.”
In the years before the 2008 financial crisis, more than a third of Harvard MBAs, and a similar proportion of graduates of the London School of Economics, went to work for financial firms.
(Some might cynically say that keeping MBAs and economists out of real businesses is a blessing, but I doubt that that is really true.)
The authors find another intriguing effect, too.
Periods of rapid growth in lending are often associated with construction booms, partly because real-estate assets are relatively easy to post as collateral for loans.
But the rate of productivity growth in construction is low, and the value of many credit-fueled projects subsequently turns out to be low or negative.
So, should Britons look forward with enthusiasm to the future sketched by Carney?
Aspiring derivatives traders certainly will be more confident of their career prospects.
And other parts of the economy that provide services to the financial sector – Porsche dealers and strip clubs, for example – will be similarly encouraged.
But if finance continues to take a disproportionate number of the best and the brightest, there could be little British manufacturing left by 2050, and even fewer hi-tech firms than today.
Anyone concerned about economic imbalances, and about excessive reliance on a volatile financial sector, will certainly hope that this aspect of the BoE’s “forward guidance” proves as unreliable as its forecasts of unemployment have been.
How Asia Copes with America’s Zombie Consumers
A post-crisis generation of “zombie consumers” in the United States is likely to hobble growth in global consumption for years to come. And that means that export-led developing Asia now has no choice but to turn inward and rely on its own 3.5 billion consumers.
Of course, this is not the first time that Asia has had to cope with the walking economic dead.
Japan’s corporate zombies were at the epicenter of its first “lost decade” in the 1990’s.
Sclerotic companies were put on life-support credit lines by their zaibatsu – like banking partners – delaying their inevitable failure and perpetuating inefficiencies and disincentives that resulted in a post-bubble collapse in Japanese productivity growth.
Similarly, the crisis of 2008-2009 led to zombie-creating bailouts in the West.
From Wall Street to AIG to Detroit, the US was quick to rescue corporate giants that would have failed otherwise.
Britain and Europe did the same, throwing lifelines to RBS, HBOS-Lloyds, Fortis, Hypo Real Estate, and others.
In the West, the excuse was “too big to fail.” How different is that from Japan’s mindset nearly 20 years ago?
But the most prominent zombie may well be a broad cross-section of American consumers who are still suffering from the ravages of the Great Recession.
Afflicted by historically high unemployment, massive under-employment, and relatively stagnant real wages, while burdened with underwater mortgages, excessive debt, and subpar saving, US consumers are stretched as never before.
Yet the US government has tried virtually everything to prevent consumers from adjusting.
Going well beyond the requisite extension of unemployment-insurance benefits, the safety net has been expanded to include home-foreclosure containment programs, other forms of debt forgiveness, and extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Compassion is part of the moral fabric of any society. But a fine line separates it from the “creative destruction” that is essential to purge a post-crisis system of its excesses.
Japan crossed that line in the 1990’s, as its corporate zombies prevented the painful but necessary adjustments in its post-bubble economy. That could happen in the US if Washington continues to favor policies that condone the reckless excesses of the recent past and inhibit the deleveraging and balance-sheet repair that America’s zombie consumers now need for post-crisis healing.
Notwithstanding government life-support initiatives, US consumers seem headed for years of retrenchment.
Consumption’s share of US GDP currently stands at a sharply elevated 70%.
While that’s down from the high of 71.3% in early 2009, it remains fully four percentage points above the 66% norm that prevailed in the final quarter of the twentieth century.
Reversion to that earlier share is likely as American consumers make the transition from the insanity of the boom to the sanity required of the bust.
That spells subdued growth in US consumption for years to come – with a predictably massive impact on global consumption.
While the US accounts for only 4.5% of the world’s population, its consumers spend $10.3 trillion annually – by far the most in the world.
So, with US consumption growth likely to be restrained, who will take America’s place?
Europe?
Japan?
I wouldn’t bet on either.
That’s where Asia fits into the equation. As an export-led region, Asia remains heavily dependent on end-market demand from consumers in the developed world.
The export share of developing Asia’s 12 largest economies rose from 35% of pan-regional output in the late 1990’s to 45% in early 2007.
Little wonder that every economy in the region either fell into recession or experienced sharp slowdowns when global trade plunged in late 2008. Decoupling was not an option.
Nor should Asia draw a false sense of security from all the hype currently being accorded to the hopes and dreams of a so-called “two-speed world.”
Heavily dependent on Western markets, Asia must seek support from a new source of demand.
For developing Asia as a whole, internal private consumption currently stands at a record low of just 45% of GDP – down ten percentage points from the 55% share prevailing as recently as 2002.
It’s not as if Asian consumer demand is dormant.
But at the margin, economic growth is heavily skewed toward exports and fixed investment as the primary means of absorbing surplus labor and spreading prosperity. In a post-crisis world – impaired by America’s zombie consumers – export-led Asia is in serious need of a pro-consumption rebalancing.
Nowhere is that more evident than in China.
With private consumption having fallen to a record low of 35% of GDP in 2008 (fully ten percentage points below the Asian norm), China faces major rebalancing imperatives – all the more urgent if post-crisis consumption growth in the West remains weak.
The good news is that China appears to have arrived at a similar conclusion.
Its 12th Five-Year Plan is focused on three major pro-consumption initiatives: jobs (especially labor-intensive services); wages (underscored by accelerated urbanization); and a reduction of fear-driven precautionary saving (arising out of a broadening of the social safety net).
If China delivers on each of these three fronts – as I suspect it will – private consumption’s share of Chinese GDP could rise by as much as five percentage points between now and 2015.
That would be good news for East Asia’s other economies – namely, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
With relatively small populations – and a declining one in the case of Japan – these countries have no choice but to rely on exports and external demand to drive economic growth.
In all three cases, China has replaced the US as their major export market.
That shift came just in the nick of time.
If China is successful in implementing its pro-consumption agenda, the rest of Asia will be well positioned to avoid the fallout from America’s new generation of zombie consumers.
How the United States copes is a different matter altogether.

How Brazil Broke Loose
CAMBRIDGE – Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s visit last week to Washington, DC, offers an occasion to consider how some once-poor countries have broken out of poverty, as Brazil has.
Development institutions like the World Bank have advocated improving business law as being essential to success.
Are they right?
Such thinking goes back at least as far as Max Weber’s argument that an effective business environment requires a legal structure as predictable as a clock.
Investors, it is thought, need clear rules and effective courts.
Security of contract and strong mechanisms that protect investors are, in this view, foundational for finance, which in turn fuels economic growth.
If a potential financier is unsure of being repaid, he or she will not invest, firms will not grow, and economic development will stall.
Rules and institutions come first; real economic development follows.
But, compelling as this logic seems, Brazil’s rise does not confirm it: financial and economic growth was not preceded by – or even accompanied by – fundamental improvements in courts and contracts.
Growth is unmistakable: Brazil’s financial markets have expanded robustly, with stock-market capitalization rising from 35% of GDP in 2000 to 74% in 2010.
In the eight years prior to 2004, only six companies went public; in the eight years since, 138 have.
Last year, Brazil overtook the United Kingdom – often seen as an exemplar of contractual security – as the world’s sixth-largest economy.
And yet legal change was not central in Brazil’s success.
Brazilian courts were reputed in 2000 to handle investors’ lawsuits slowly and poorly, and they are reputed to handle them slowly and poorly today.
Even basic elements of business organization – like limiting public shareholders’ obligation for corporate debts – are said by Brazilian legal experts, such as Bruno Salama, to remain an open question, with all shareholders potentially exposed, especially in labor and tax lawsuits.
If courts are not protecting investors, is something else?
New, important stock-exchange rules have strengthened outside investors’ confidence, though only for new companies.
For legal scholars, most prominently Columbia University’s John Coffee, stock exchanges have historically been the first step toward protecting investors.
An analysis by Ronald Gilson, Henry Hansmann, and Mariana Pargendler of Brazil’s Novo Mercado – the stock exchange’s special voluntary listing segment, which provides strong protections for investors in newly listed companies – supports this view.
But stock exchanges have limits, particularly in Brazil.
In the absence of reliable courts, they cannot sue to enforce their rules.
Their only recourse is to push recalcitrant firms off the exchange.
The Novo Mercado dealt with this problem by subjecting disputes involving its newly-listed companies to arbitration.
Commercial arbitration – and courts’ obligations to enforce the arbitrators’ decisions – can assure investors, even if the courts generally do not.
But arbitration – which has yet to be deeply tested for resolving disputes on the Novo Mercado – does not seem to be the linchpin of Brazil’s recent success.
After all, its institutional innovations apply only to the new Novo Mercado-listed companies, and not to the bulk of the Brazilian economy’s big firms, which are listed on the stock exchange’s main segment, and thus remain stuck with the old rules, old institutions, and an ineffective court system.
Two other key changes, one obvious and one surprising, were more essential to Brazil’s financial development.
The obvious change is that economic-growth opportunities mushroomed, owing to greater monetary stability, disinflation, and natural-resource wealth.
Better macroeconomic policy led to faster GDP growth, which required financing and motivated some insiders to forego pernicious maneuvering that would scare away new outside investors.
Growth plausibly drove financial development as much as, or more than, institutional development did.
While public and private enforcement will need to improve if Brazil’s economy is to move to the next level, dramatic legal improvement has not underpinned Brazil’s overall financial development so far.
The second change is both less obvious and more important: the political stability that came with the election in 2002 of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The surprise here is that Lula, a former labor leader who had been on the far left, was widely opposed, if not despised, in business and financial circles.
How, then, did his victory help to fuel the financial growth of the subsequent decade?
Despite his past, Lula promised not to disrupt Brazilian corporate capitalism, running with a market-oriented vice president.
Why he did so is difficult to determine: quite plausibly, some combination of Lula’s realism, his reaction to stock-market declines attributed to his chances of being elected, and campaign donations was at work.
Once elected, Lula governed from the pragmatic left, continuing the prior administration’s core policies.
True, Brazil still has a “hard” left, and some in Lula’s own party are comfortable with, say, Cuba’s Castro brothers and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.
But a consensus had emerged in Brazil that a left party could neither win nor govern with hard-left ideas, and Lula’s presidency did not challenge this view.
The consensus may have reflected the success of Lula’s predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the relative success of privatization and liberal market economies around the world, and the growth of Brazil’s middle class.
Whatever the case, for key leaders of the Brazilian left, including Rousseff, capitalism became part of the solution, not the fundamental problem.
Investors take all kinds of risks.
The biggest are not always the legal ones on which the World Bank and development agencies have focused; rather, they are the business risks of a company that fails or a polity that implodes.
If business conditions are auspicious and there is a strong consensus in favor of liberal capitalism as the polity’s core economic principle, financial markets can develop and reluctantly absorb risks stemming from the legal system’s defects.
Institutional improvements help, but they can come later.
How China Is Winning Southeast Asia
WASHINGTON, DC – With preparations for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s September visit to Washington, DC, underway, officials in both countries are predictably playing down their differences over China’s outsize territorial claims, backed by the construction of military facilities on previously uninhabited islands and atolls, in the South China Sea.
And this diplomatic de-escalation, following months of recriminations and veiled threats, suits Southeast Asian leaders just fine.
Of course, no one in Southeast Asia is ignoring China’s strategic designs.
The region’s defense spending has increased by more than 50% in the last decade, and some $60 billion has been earmarked for new weapons, especially naval hardware, over the next five years.
The white paper on military strategy that China released in May, which touted plans to expand the country’s defense perimeter, intensified neighbors’ concerns, making even more military spending likely.
Leaders in the region are now welcoming a stream of US military officials and defense manufacturers to see what America’s Asian “pivot” has to offer.
Beyond new frigates and security guarantees, however, Southeast Asian leaders have refrained from reacting too strongly to China’s offshore ambitions.
The economic facts on the ground demand prudence.
In only two decades, China has become Southeast Asian countries’ leading economic partner, boosting its influence throughout the region.
Chinese leaders’ constant effort to expand economic cooperation stands in stark contrast to America’s approach to the region.
Consider trade.
Since 2000, bilateral trade between China and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has grown tenfold, from $32 billion to $350 billion last year, and could reach $500 billion in 2015.
As China has risen to become Southeast Asia’s largest trading partner, the US has slipped to fourth place, with only $206 billion in total trade with ASEAN last year.
Given Southeast Asia’s growing economic importance, the implications of this trend could not be weightier.
The ASEAN countries’ combined annual GDP is already $2.4 trillion and growing fast, owing to their rapidly expanding middle class, highly skilled workers, and increasingly upscale markets.
If the current trend holds, China’s trade with ASEAN could reach $1 trillion by 2020.
The picture for direct investment – the financial flows that support the construction of factories, offices, warehouses, mines, and farms – is equally striking.
From 1995 to 2003, Chinese companies invested a mere $631 million in ASEAN countries; in 2013, they invested $30 billion.
Though China remains well behind Japan, Europe, and the US on this front, it certainly has the potential to catch up, as Chinese private-equity firms increasingly look abroad.
Indeed, from agriculture to information technology, the Chinese are diversifying their stakes across the region and embedding their companies in ASEAN’s advanced and frontier economies.
China’s Southeast Asian partners cannot afford to ignore these efforts.
That is one reason why all ten ASEAN countries signed on as founding members of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite US opposition.
China, which has pledged $100 billion in initial investment, has positioned the AIIB as a rival to the US-dominated World Bank, promising to help Asian countries meet their extensive infrastructure needs.
Clearly, when it comes to its role in Asia, China is thinking big.
And there is more.
At last year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, regional leaders agreed to begin work toward possible adoption of a Chinese-backed free-trade pact – one that is clearly meant to push back against US President Barack Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes China.
Whether or not Xi realizes his free-trade ambition, there is no denying China’s commitment to deepening its economic ties in Asia and beyond.
The country has pledged some $60 billion to its “One Belt, One Road” initiative, which entails the construction of a Silk Road Economic Belt running through Central Asia, and a Maritime Silk Road connecting China to Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and eventually Europe.
The US, meanwhile, is struggling to cobble together a domestic consensus on trade.
To be sure, China has had its setbacks, too.
Canceled railway and hydroelectric projects in Myanmar, and riots in Vietnam over China’s move to drill for oil in disputed waters, reflect the backlash that the country’s resource hunger can generate.
But China is also certain to learn from its mistakes, and its leaders have a clear vision of where to place their long-term economic bets.
At a time when partisan divisions are undermining America’s economic leadership, China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia should raise a question: If push comes to shove in the South China Sea, will the US find allies in its corner, or will they just be holding Uncle Sam’s coat?
The HICCup Manifesto
NEW YORK – It is hard to find anyone in health care who does not believe that spending $100 now on healthy behavior – exercise and proper nutrition, counseling for pre-diabetics, risk monitoring, and so on – could yield more than $200 in reduced costs and improved outcomes later.
The numbers are fuzzy, of course, and there are plenty of methodological caveats, but there is little dispute about the desirability of such an approach.
And yet neither individuals nor communities seem to act on the basis of this knowledge.
Individuals often lack willpower or access to healthy food or convenient exercise facilities, and are surrounded by poor examples that encourage instant gratification rather than effort and restraint.
And, on a broader, institutional scale, the money spent and the money to be gained do not belong to the same pocket.
Instead of just complaining, I recently decided to create HICCup, the Health Intervention Coordinating Council, a self-appointed counseling service aimed at persuading local institutions to embrace a long-term perspective and launch a full-scale intervention in their communities.
For practical reasons, there are a few guidelines – but anyone who wants to do this without following our rules is welcome to do so.
For starters, HICCup will focus on communities of 100,000 people or fewer.
The majority of the community and its institutions must be enthusiastic.
If most community members work for just a few employers and obtain health care from just a few providers, the effort of corralling the players will be easier.
And, of course, community leaders – the mayor, city council members, and others – must work together rather than undermine one another.
So, how will this be funded?
Not by HICCup.
The trick is to capture some of what is being spent on health care already.
As a rough calculation, assume $10,000 in annual per capita health-care costs, or $1 billion per year in a community of 100,000.
(There are also all the separate costs of bad health, which are much harder to count or capture.)
That money ultimately comes from individuals and employers who pay it in taxes, insurance premiums, or direct payments, and should be intercepted somewhere between the payers and the health-care delivery system.
Instead of spending $1 billion a year, imagine spending $1.2 billion the first year, but, say, only $750 million in the fifth year.
That sounds like an attractive proposition – but someone must make the initial investment in exchange for a claim to the later savings.
(And, one way or another, the investor will need to repurpose the health-care facilities and workers to some other role, including prevention, serving outsiders, or conversion to another use entirely.)
This is where the first miracle is needed – a benevolent but ultimately profit-driven billionaire or hedge fund, or a philanthropy that sees a way to do good while earning money for future goodness.
There are a lot of billionaires out there, some with vision.
There are health-care companies that might bite, hedge funds looking for large-scale projects, and so-called social-impact bonds.
There also are large employers that might decide to work with other employers in certain communities.
All of these entities would be taking a substantial leap of faith.
But I think it is doable – especially if they work together to figure out the numbers, study the effects of small-scale healthy-living/preventive health-care efforts, and encourage one another to move forward.
Regardless, each investor must work with existing institutions – if only to access revenue streams initially and benefit from the lowered costs later on.
Although grants are a nice source of funding for demonstration projects and research, only a for-profit approach that attracts broader investment will ensure that this scheme catches on.
The funder makes a deal with whoever is responsible for the health-care costs: upfront investment in exchange for continued payment of the $1 billion yearly baseline, with the funder to keep the future savings against originally predicted costs.
The money may be paid by employers, private insurers, or government health-care funds (the trickiest source).
Community officials and voluntary organizations also need to sign on – or, indeed, they could drive the process and find the investors themselves.
They could also contribute with complementary changes in school meals and gym classes; zoning and other planning measures to encourage cycling, walking, and the like; provision of health counseling; and perhaps by working with local restaurants and food stores to subsidize healthy choices and discourage unhealthy ones.
The X Prize Foundation once promoted this idea, but dropped it when a funder lost interest.
But there are many smaller-scale examples, such as Oklahoma City, which lost one million pounds of collective weight in a population of about 600,000; we hope the people involved will join with HICCup to share their experiences, good and bad.
Indeed, HICCup will not choose which communities participate.
They will choose themselves.
HICCup’s role will be to advise them and help them to communicate and learn from other communities going through the same process.
We also want to be a clearinghouse for vendors of health-oriented tools, services, and programs.
There are many bargains to be struck between communities and vendors offering discounts in exchange for wholesale adoption of their tools or programs.
There is, however, one unbreakable rule: To work with HICCup, communities must collect and publish a lot of independently vetted data (without personal information, of course).
For starters, they will need benchmarks of current conditions and projected costs, and then detailed statistics on the adoption of the measures, their impact and costs, and what happens over time.
HICCup will spend a lot of time with lawyers and actuaries!
Indicators to be measured include not just rates of obesity, high blood pressure, and incidence of disease and related costs, but also absenteeism, school grades and graduation rates, employment statistics, accidents, and the like.
Although the funder keeps the reduction in health-care costs, the community gets all of the many payoffs from a healthier population – including an enhanced reputation.
It is now time to try this on a broad scale.
Five years from now, we will wonder what took us so long to get started.
So, again, who will those investors be?
How Does the Weak Dollar Affect Oil Prices?
Around the world, there is anguished hand-wringing about the high price of oil.
But if political leaders and policymakers want lower oil prices, they should be promoting policies that strengthen the dollar.
The implications of pricing oil in any single-currency are more far-reaching than most people think.
For example, some oil-producing countries ask their customers to pay in euros, but that does not mean that their oil is priced in euros.
And even if dollar prices were to be replaced by euro prices, the impact of single-currency pricing on the oil market would be the same.   
While oil-exporting countries receive revenues in dollars (or their euro equivalent), they use different currencies to import goods and services from various countries.
Any change in the exchange rate of the dollar affects the purchasing power of these countries, and therefore their real income. 
Likewise, international oil companies sell most of their oil in dollars, but they operate in various countries and pay some of their costs in local currencies.
Any change in the value of the dollar therefore affects their cost structure and profitability. In turn, it affects reinvestment in exploration, development, and maintenance.
The relationship between the value of the dollar and oil prices is very complex.
While they can feed on each other to produce a vicious cycle, their short-term relationship is distinct from their long-term relationship.
In the short-term, dollar depreciation does not affect supply and demand, but it does affect speculation and investment in oil futures markets.
As the dollar declines, commodities – including oil – attract investors.
Investing in futures becomes both a hedge against a weakening dollar and an investment vehicle that could yield substantial profit, particularly in a climate of vanishing excess oil production capacity, increasing demand, declining interest rates, a slumping real estate market, and crisis in the banking industry.
OPEC might be correct to blame American policies and speculators for higher prices.
It is also correct that if OPEC had excess capacity, it would have already used it to flush out speculators to bring oil prices down.
OPEC can regain control in one of two ways: use its “claimed” excess capacity to flush out speculators, or use its financial surpluses to overtake them.
Recourse to the latter option means that, even without excess capacity, OPEC can still be in the driver’s seat.
In the long run, however, statistical analysis of various oil industry variables indicates that a weaker dollar affects supply by reducing production, regardless of whether oil is owned and produced by national or international oil companies.
A weak dollar also affects demand by increasing consumption.
The result of a decrease in supply and an increase in demand is higher prices.
The lower dollar also reduces the purchasing power of oil exporters.
If nominal oil prices remain constant while the dollar declines, the real income of the oil-producing countries declines, resulting in less investment in additional capacity and maintenance.
The same is true of oil companies.
Consequently, oil prices increase.
Indeed, because oil prices were rising while the dollar was declining, capacity expansion by oil firms failed to meet forecasts for non-OPEC production in the last three years.
Even oil production in the United States has not matched the increase in oil prices, as rising import costs for tools and equipment – partly a reflection of the dollar’s weakness and other factors – have forced project delays and cancellations.
Of course, the lower dollar means cheaper oil in Europe, Asia, and all countries with appreciating currencies.
Oil prices hit records in the US in 2004 and 2005, but not in Europe, which partly explains why economic growth there has not been affected.
When Americans paid $120 per barrel, Europeans paid only about €76 per barrel.
Several factors have prevented high oil prices from affecting the demand for petroleum products in the US in recent years, such as increased government spending, low interest rates, tax breaks, and an increase in real incomes.
To be sure, the weaker dollar has forced some American families to spend their vacations in the US instead of Europe.
But, since many Americans use gas-guzzling SUV’s for their vacations, demand for gasoline has remained high.
Unless and until US consumption patterns change or a rebounding dollar increases oil production, Americans will bear the brunt of single-currency oil pricing.  
How Economic Superpowers Rise
Anti-Japanese riots across China have heightened tensions in Asia.
Indeed China-mania, a mixture of hopes, but mostly fears, is sweeping the world due to China’s rapid economic rise.
Should the world really be more fearful than hopeful?
Americans fear their markets being flooded by Chinese goods.
Mexico, Brazil, Central Europe, Indonesia, and even Sri Lanka are worried about competition from lower wages.
Europeans may be more cheerful, believing that the Chinese market will open not only for European engineering products and machine tools to equip the new workshop of the world, but also for luxury goods and even the tourism demanded by a new and affluent Chinese middle class.
Everyone feels that a seismic shift is under way.
Such rapid industrial rises are rare, but not unprecedented.
The most interesting analogies are Germany’s rise in the 19th century and Japan’s in the 20th.
Even prior to that time, England was the economic Wunderkind of Europe.
What had been an offshore European island with bad weather emerged as the world’s major economy, whose products, from textiles to railroad equipment, came to dominate world markets.
England was a pioneer in industrialization, and was deeply shocked by the presumption of newcomers who soon entered the same stage.
By the end of the 19th century, however, Germany, with much lower wages levels, had overtaken England in steel production, and was clearly dominant in the new technologies of electrical goods, chemicals, and dyes, as well as in many aspects of fine engineering.
But Germany also swamped world’s markets with mass consumption goods: cheaper musical instruments than the traditional makers in France or Italy could produce, and lithographic prints used for Christmas cards and seaside postcards.
Indeed, German products were omnipresent.
When an irate British writer, E.E. Williams, wrote a protest entitled “Made in Germany,” he began by recording his discomfort that the pencil he was using was a German product as well.
The ‘Made in Germany’ scare of the late 19th century foreshadowed the reaction in the United States to Japan’s industrial success in the 1960’s and 1970’s.
In particular, Americans were frightened by Japanese consumer products – televisions, which wiped out domestic production, and automobiles, which seemed so malignly efficient.
In both the German and the Japanese cases, the already-existing industrial powers complained that there was some sort of nefarious and unfair mechanism behind the newcomer’s advantages.
Such explanations included government intervention or a new sort of industrial organization, and unfair patent infringements by the new producers who copied products and then blocked off their own markets from import competition.
But the economics of the rise of industrial Germany and Japan should hold comforting lessons for us today.
The fears were misplaced, because the world benefited from cheaper and more readily available products.
Thanks to German manufacturers, pianos were no longer restricted to aristocratic salons or the professional middle class, but began appearing in respectable working-class homes.
Thanks to Japanese car producers, American manufacturers learned to produce more efficiently and competitively.
The classical liberal free-trade argument about the universal economic benefits of greater commerce and open markets proved to be unambiguously correct.
It did not matter that the catch-up countries’ economic “miracles” were produced in part by illiberal policies guided by government bureaucracies.
The outcome was an endorsement of the lessons of economic liberalism.
But changing economic balances also lead to changing political balances.
At the moment, it looks as if there is nothing to fear from China.
Like Germany in the mid-19th century, or Japan in the 1960’s, China sees many advantages in participating in the international order more or less as it is currently configured.
Can this change?
Germany certainly became assertive, owing mostly to the social pressures and tensions incited by rapid economic growth.
When it feared that it might be overtaken by the next rising economic power, the vast Russian empire, assertiveness turned into aggression.
By the early 20th century, Germans had concluded that Russia’s faster demographic growth and rapid industrialization posed a military threat.
China can already see considerable problems in the medium term.
In forty years, a demographic implosion within China, the consequence of its one-child policy, will make European and Japanese concerns about aging populations look trivial.
Before then, profound inequalities between China’s poor countryside and its dynamic industrial centers will generate tensions, which may be increased by the gender imbalance – young men greatly outnumber young women.
Combine this with a tottering authoritarian regime, and something like the pre-1914 German scenario looks realistic.
A government impressed by past national achievement, but fearful of being overtaken and deeply worried about its own legitimacy, is likely to look for an outlet in foreign policy to mobilize domestic support or ward off opposition.
So there is no need for a strategy to deal with China’s economic rise; but there is a need to lock in China’s prosperity and reduce the chances of political eruption.
Japan in the second half of the 20th century had stable politics, due in large part to a good constitution and democratic institutions.
If China is to avoid the fate of early 20th century Germany, it must bolster successful economic modernization with constitutional and political reform.
Our Children’s Economics
TOKYO – The economics profession has not had a good crisis.
Queen Elizabeth II may have expected too much when she famously asked why economists had failed to foresee the disaster, but there is a widespread sense that much of their research turned out to be irrelevant.
Worse still, much of the advice proffered by economists was of little use to policymakers seeking to limit the economic and financial fallout.
Will future generations do better?
One of the more interesting exercises in which I engaged at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos was a collective effort to imagine the contents of a Principles of Economics textbook in 2033.
There was no dearth of ideas and topics, participants argued, that existing textbooks neglected, and that should receive more attention two decades from now.
Economists working on the border of economics and psychology, for example, argued that behavioral finance, in which human foibles are brought to bear to explain the failure of the so-called efficient markets hypothesis, would be given more prominence.
Economic historians, meanwhile, argued that future textbooks would embed analysis of recent experience in the longer-term historical record.
Among other things, this would allow economists-in-training to take the evolution of economic institutions more seriously.
Development economists, for their part, argued that much more attention would be paid to randomized trials and field experiments.
Applied econometricians pointed to the growing importance of “big data” and to the likelihood that large data sets will have significantly enhanced our understanding of economic decision-making by 2033.
Overall, however, the picture was one in which the economics of 2033 differed only marginally from the economics of today.
A textbook two decades from now might be more sophisticated than this year’s edition, fully integrating contributions that today constitute the frontiers of economic research.
But it would not differ fundamentally in structure or approach from today’s economics.
The consensus, in other words, seemed to be that there would be nothing in the next 20 years as transformative as Alfred Marshall’s synthesis of the 1890’s or the revolution initiated by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930’s.
In contrast to the economics of those years, economics today is a mature, well-established discipline.
And, like any mature discipline, it advances incrementally rather than in revolutionary steps.
This presumption is almost certainly mistaken.
It reflects the same error made by scholars of technology who argue that all of the radical breakthroughs have already been made.
As this view is sometimes put, the next 20 years will see no breakthrough as revolutionary as the steam engine or the transistor.
Technological progress will be incremental rather than revolutionary.
Indeed, insofar as the increments are small, the result is likely to be slower productivity growth and a “Great Stagnation.”
In fact, the history of technology has repeatedly refuted this pessimistic view.
We can’t say what the next radical innovation will be, but centuries of human experience suggest that there will be (at least) one.
Similarly, we can’t say what the next revolution in economic analysis will be, but more than a century of modern economic thinking suggests that there will be one.
All of this suggests that the economics textbook of 2033 will look very different from the economics textbook of today.
We just can’t say how.
Indeed, one might question the very premise that, two decades from now, there will be textbooks as we know them.
Today, introductory economics is taught using a textbook in which an eminent professor authoritatively bestows the conventional wisdom on his or her (typically, his) students.
Knowledge, as encapsulated in the textbook and interpreted by the professor, is delivered from above.
This, of course, is also how newspapers traditionally delivered the news.
Editors and publishers assembled and collated stories, and the newspaper that they produced was then delivered to the subscriber’s doorstep.
But the last decade has seen a veritable revolution in the news business.
News is now assembled and disseminated via Web sites, wikis, and the comment sections of blogs.
News, in other words, is increasingly delivered from the bottom up.
Rather than relying on editors, everyone is becoming their own news curator.
Something similar is likely to happen to textbooks, especially in economics, where everyone has an opinion and first-hand experience with the subject.
Textbooks will be like wikis, with faculty adopters and students modifying text and contributing content.
There still may be a role for the author as gatekeeper; but the textbook will know longer be the font of wisdom, and its writer will no longer control the table of contents.
The outcome will be messy.
But the economics profession will also become more diverse and dynamic – and our children’s economics will be healthier as a result.
The Tyranny of Political Economy
CAMBRIDGE – There was a time when we economists steered clear of politics.
We viewed our job as describing how market economies work, when they fail, and how well-designed policies can enhance efficiency.
We analyzed trade-offs between competing objectives (say, equity versus efficiency), and prescribed policies to meet desired economic outcomes, including redistribution.
It was up to politicians to take our advice (or not), and to bureaucrats to implement it.
Then some of us became more ambitious.
Frustrated by the reality that much of our advice went unheeded (so many free-market solutions still waiting to be taken up!), we turned our analytical toolkit on the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats themselves.
We began to examine political behavior using the same conceptual framework that we use for consumer and producer decisions in a market economy.
Politicians became income-maximizing suppliers of policy favors; citizens became rent-seeking lobbies and special interests; and political systems became marketplaces in which votes and political influence are traded for economic benefits.
Thus was born the field of rational-choice political economy, and a style of theorizing that many political scientists readily emulated.
The apparent payoff was that we could now explain why politicians did so many things that violated economic rationality.
Indeed, there was no economic malfunction that the two words “vested interests” could not account for.
Why are so many industries closed off to real competition?
Because politicians are in the pockets of the incumbents who reap the rents.
Why do governments erect barriers to international trade?
Because the beneficiaries of trade protection are concentrated and politically influential, while consumers are diffuse and disorganized.
Why do political elites block reforms that would spur economic growth and development?&#160; Because growth and development would undermine their hold on political power.
Why are there financial crises?
Because banks capture the policymaking process so that they can take excessive risks at the expense of the general public.
In order to change the world, we need to understand it.
And this mode of analysis seemed to transport us to a higher level of understanding of economic and political outcomes.
But there was a deep paradox in all of this.
The more we claimed to be explaining, the less room was left for improving matters.
If politicians’ behavior is determined by the vested interests to which they are beholden, economists’ advocacy of policy reforms is bound to fall on deaf ears.
The more complete our social science, the more irrelevant our policy analysis.
This is where the analogy between human sciences and natural sciences breaks down.
Consider the relationship between science and engineering.
As scientists’ understanding of the physical laws of nature grows more sophisticated, engineers can build better bridges and buildings.
Improvements in natural science enhance, rather than impede, our ability to shape our physical environment.
The relationship between political economy and policy analysis is not at all like this.
By endogenizing politicians’ behavior, political economy disempowers policy analysts.
It is as if physicists came up with theories that explained not only natural phenomena, but also determined which bridges and buildings engineers would build.
There would then scarcely be any need for engineering schools.
If it seems to you that something is wrong with this, you are on to something.
In reality, our contemporary frameworks for political economy are replete with unstated assumptions about the system of ideas underlying the operation of political systems.
Make those assumptions explicit, and the decisive role of vested interests evaporates.
Policy design, political leadership, and human agency come back to life.
There are three ways in which ideas shape interests.
First, ideas determine how political elites define themselves and the objectives they pursue – money, honor, status, longevity in power, or simply a place in history.
These questions of identity are central to how they choose to act.
Second, ideas determine political actors’ views about how the world works.
Powerful business interests will lobby for different policies when they believe that fiscal stimulus yields only inflation than when they believe that it generates higher aggregate demand.
Revenue hungry governments will impose a lower tax when they think that it can be evaded than when they think that it cannot.
Most important from the perspective of policy analysis, ideas determine the strategies that political actors believe they can pursue.
For example, one way for elites to remain in power is to suppress all economic activity.
But another is to encourage economic development while diversifying their own economic base, establishing coalitions, fostering state-directed industrialization, or pursuing a variety of other strategies limited only by the elites’ imagination.
Expand the range of feasible strategies (which is what good policy design and leadership do), and you radically change behavior and outcomes.
Indeed, this is what explains some of the most astounding turnarounds in economic performance in recent decades, such as South Korea’s and China’s breakout growth (in the 1960’s and the late 1970’s, respectively).
In both cases, the biggest winners were “vested interests” (Korea’s business establishment and the Chinese Communist Party).
What enabled reform was not a reconfiguration of political power, but the emergence of new strategies.
Economic change often happens not when vested interests are defeated, but when different strategies are used to pursue those interests.
Political economy undoubtedly remains important.
Without a clear understanding of who gains and who loses from the status quo, it is difficult to make sense of our existing policies.
But an excessive focus on vested interests can easily divert us from the critical contribution that policy analysis and political entrepreneurship can make.
The possibilities of economic change are limited not just by the realities of political power, but also by the poverty of our ideas.
How Effective is Disaster Relief?
When disaster strikes, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are among the first on the scene.
The United Nations estimates that there are now more than 37,000 international NGOs, with major donors relying on them more and more.
Inevitably, there are problems.
Both the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami saw chaotic competition among NGOs.
Yet there have also been landmark successes.
More than 1,400 NGOs operating in 90 countries helped to get 123 countries to ratify the treaty banning landmines.
But the sheer scale of the disaster relief “industry” – plus the longer-term development efforts of NGOs – is raising serious concerns about how to measure their performance.
Flexibility allows NGOs to be innovative in ways that organizations like the UN often cannot.
But there are few international rules on what an NGO actually is, and the lack of control can lead to unpredictable consequences.
In Chad recently, the French NGO L’Arche de Zoé tried to smuggle children out of the country without obtaining permission from either parents or the government.
Among the questions being asked by NGOs, the UN, and national donors is how to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes.
The wake-up call for most NGOs came after the Rwandan genocide, when hundreds of small organizations tried to set up ad hoc operations in refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. Some camps turned into staging posts for armed factions.
In the ensuing chaos, more than 50,000 refugees died from cholera.
There was also mayhem following the Indian Ocean tsunami.
At one point, more than 400 NGOs were on the ground in Aceh, Indonesia, competing for resources, personnel, and funding.
Many of the lessons learned in Rwanda were forgotten or ignored as smaller NGOs with little or no experience in dealing with disasters caused much of the confusion.
The situation in Indonesia led the UN to adopt a new “cluster” system to improve coordination.
And, after a review of the Rwanda debacle, 400 NGOs and UN organizations working in 80 countries got together in the Sphere Project to develop a common humanitarian mandate and handbook of standards outlining the minimum performance required of any NGO working in a disaster zone.
As the number of post-intervention reviews increases, a rudimentary framework for evaluating the impact of NGOs has appeared.
Rather than simply looking at project inputs and outputs, the emphasis has turned towards measuring the overall impact of an operation.
The idea is to find out if the lives of the people on the receiving end were changed for the better in any sustained way.
More and more donors are also insisting that NGOs provide measurable proof that they make a difference.
That sounds fine in theory, but in practice there are drawbacks.
By demanding quantifiable results, donors may force program managers to choose easily achieved targets over less measurable actions that accord with sound humanitarian principles.
Or reporting about aid programs may be skewed to keep donor funds flowing.
The greatest danger is that humanitarian relief will be tailored to meet donors’ demands, rather than actual needs.
Until recently, the record on evaluating responses to humanitarian emergencies has been patchy at best.
CARE, as both a relief and development agency, can take a long-term approach to disasters, matching emergency relief with a rehabilitation and recovery phase.
But this is not an option for NGOs that focus only on emergency responses.
Once their allotted time is up – or their funds run out – they tend to pack up and leave.
Even for NGOs that stick around, determining their relief efforts’ impact in the middle of a crisis is difficult, if not impossible.
Emergencies are chaotic: staff and resources are stretched, the local population is very unlikely to be able to provide meaningful feedback, and pre-crisis baseline data are largely unavailable, so comparisons are complicated.
Moreover, all too often, events move too quickly to be measured accurately.
And, until recently, donors who were willing to pay for relief were less likely to finance follow-up evaluations.
As a result, emergency relief evaluations often rely on little more than guesswork and assumptions.
A 2004 report by the Humanitarian Policy Group cited a survey carried out in Ethiopia after UN agencies said that humanitarian efforts had averted widespread famine in 2000.
The claim sounded credible until the subsequent survey showed that the area’s crude mortality rate had actually risen to six times the normal base rate.
Most of the deaths were from communicable diseases, which malnourished people may well have contracted after crowding into feeding centers.
The HPG therefore recommended long-term monitoring of future humanitarian responses, and said that success or failure should be judged in a broad context rather than by a narrow focus on a specific project.
Many people who survive an earthquake or a flood, for instance, may soon face another crisis if the disaster also destroys their only means of earning a living.
New and more sophisticated analytical tools are needed to understand these long-term effects, along with sufficient training to ensure that new methods are applied properly in the field.
A recent innovation has been the Coping Strategy Index, devised by the World Food Program and CARE, which analyzes how people cope with short-term food crises while also taking into account their future vulnerability to hunger.
NGOs do the lion’s share of the world’s humanitarian work, and some mistakes are inevitable.
But as we deepen our experience of humanitarian relief and development, we must learn the lessons of the past and understand how much more there is to know.
Avoiding Algeria in Egypt
PORTO – The military coup that has overthrown Egypt’s first democratically elected president and led to the arrests of Muslim Brotherhood leaders across the country poses an enormous danger not only for Egypt’s democratic transition, but for the democratic hopes of the entire Arab world as well.
The fact that the coup was undertaken with massive popular support is a sign of the enormous difficulties faced by the Muslim Brotherhood during its first turn in power.
President Mohamed Morsi’s government struggled to address Egypt’s inherited economic and social crises in the face of the enormous public expectations created by the 2011 revolution, whose protagonists sought not only freedom, but also economic development and social justice.
Of course, the Muslim Brotherhood was also a victim of its own mistakes, particularly the failure of Morsi and his government to reach out to the secular opposition, elements of which had contributed to his election.
The Morsi government seemed incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority is not enough, especially nowadays.
Indeed, the breadth of the opposition to Morsi reflects a major global tendency toward the empowerment of the educated and connected middle classes, whose members tend to be suspicious of political parties and demand more direct political participation.
In this sense, Egypt’s difficulties differ only in scope, not in kind, from those faced by governments in Turkey, Brazil, and even Europe.
Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood dominated government from its first days in power.
But it also faced opposition from a variety of other, far less democratically minded, forces, including holdovers from Hosni Mubarak’s regime, who continue to wield influence in official institutions.
The judiciary, for example, dissolved the first elected legislative assembly.
Likewise, the interior minister refused to protect the Brotherhood’s headquarters from repeated attack.
Moreover, some secular intellectuals demonized the Brotherhood.
Like their Algerian counterparts – who in 1992 approved of the Algerian army’s suppression of an Islamist electoral victory, leading to years of brutal fighting that left perhaps a half-million dead – many Egyptians didn’t mind repressing Islamists.
Morsi and the Brotherhood also faced competition from Saudi-backed Salafists.
Indeed, on the night of the coup, these ultra-conservative Islamists appeared together with military leaders and the secular political leader Mohamed ElBaradei to announce Morsi’s overthrow.
The prospects for Egypt’s democratic transition have become increasingly difficult to predict, but one thing is clear: the military cannot and must not be trusted. During the period after the fall of Mubarak, when the army exercised full power, 12,000 civilians were charged in military courts, virginity tests were imposed on women (particularly those protesting against the military), demonstrators were killed, and myriad human-rights violations were committed with impunity.
Of course, it is possible for soldiers to assure a transition to democracy, as they did four decades ago in my homeland, Portugal, following their overthrow of the Salazar/Caetano dictatorship.
But the record of military-led transitions elsewhere has been poor: democracy may be proclaimed to be the coup’s raison d’être, but the transition stops there.
Moreover, in this case, the Egyptian army appears far more interested in protecting its enormous economic interests than it is in securing the benefits of a civilian government responsive to its citizens.
Trust should still be put in young Egyptians and their demands for freedom and democracy – demands that link the movement that overthrew Mubarak to the demonstrations that led to Morsi’s removal.
But the predominant goal should be to support the creation in Egypt of a pluralistic society that defends the rights of all to political participation and free and fair elections.
Today, this requires opposition to any Mubarak-style repression of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Immediately following the coup, the European Union adopted an ambivalent position toward it.
This, too, is reminiscent of Algeria in 1992, when most European governments supported the annulment of the Islamists’ electoral victory.
(Likewise, the EU refused to recognize Hamas’s electoral victory in Gaza in 2006.)
Continuing fear of political Islam in much of the West explains past support for dictatorial regimes.
Today, the EU and the US should demand the liberation of all members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including Morsi, and the integration of the Brotherhood into any political solution.
The international community should also be concerned with the coup’s regional implications.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s cynical declaration of support for the coup is a sign that some want to turn today’s struggle in the Arab world into a bloody contest between Islamists and secularists.
In the long term, any crackdown on the Brotherhood would lead its members and supporters –&#160;already bitterly disappointed in democracy – to reject elections entirely.
That outcome could have a very negative impact on Islamist movements elsewhere.
For many, the extremists who criticized the Brotherhood and other Islamist parties for choosing a democratic route to power will have been vindicated, and a new wave of violence in the region may begin.
Hope remains that Egypt will not become Algeria in 1992 (or Chile in 1973).
But to avoid that grim fate, it is imperative that Muslim Brotherhood members’ fundamental rights now be protected.
US President Barack Obama, who has expressed deep concern about the overthrow of Morsi, is perhaps the only leader able to mediate in such a situation and work for a consensus solution that prevents a civil war.
To achieve this, he would need to use all of the leverage at his disposal, including cutting off the massive military assistance that the US provides to Egypt’s armed forces, as he has threatened to do.
He can also use the reserve of trust that he established by reaching out to the Brotherhood during Morsi’s presidency.
But will Obama take the initiative?
His speech in Cairo in 2009 – which called for “A New Beginning” in the region – inspired many in the Arab world.
Now it is time for more than words.
How Europe Can Rescue Europe
LONDON – At their meeting in Rome last Thursday, the leaders of the eurozone’s four largest economies agreed on steps towards a banking union and a modest stimulus package to complement the European Union’s new “fiscal compact.”
Those steps are not enough.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel resisted all proposals to provide relief to Spain and Italy from the excessive risk premiums that both countries are now confronting.
As a result, the EU’s upcoming summit could turn into a fiasco, which may well prove lethal, because it would leave the rest of the eurozone without a strong enough financial firewall to protect it from the possibility of a Greek exit.
Even if a fatal calamity can be avoided, the division between creditor and debtor countries will be reinforced, and the “periphery” countries will have no chance to regain competitiveness, because the playing field is tilted against them.
This may serve Germany’s narrow self-interest, but it will create a very different Europe from the open society that fired people’s imagination and propelled European integration for decades.
It will make Germany the center of an empire and permanently subordinate the “periphery.”
That is not what Merkel or the overwhelming majority of Germans stand for.
Merkel argues that it is against the rules to use the European Central Bank to solve eurozone countries’ fiscal problems – and she is right.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said much the same.
Indeed, the upcoming summit is missing an important agenda item: a European Fiscal Authority (EFA) that, in partnership with the ECB, could do what the ECB cannot do on its own.
In particular, the EFA could establish a Debt Reduction Fund – a modified form of the European Debt Redemption Pact that was proposed by Merkel’s Council of Economic Advisers and endorsed by Germany’s Social Democrats and Greens.
In exchange for specified structural reforms in Italy and Spain, the Fund would acquire and hold a significant portion of their outstanding stock of debt.
It would finance the purchases by issuing European Treasury bills – joint and several obligations of the member countries – and pass on the benefit of cheap financing to the countries concerned.
The Treasury bills would be assigned a zero-risk rating by the authorities and treated as the highest-quality collateral for repo operations at the ECB.&nbsp;The banking system has an urgent need for risk-free liquid assets.
Banks are currently holding more than €700 billion of surplus liquidity at the ECB, earning only one quarter of 1% interest.&nbsp;This assures a large and ready market for the bills at 1% or less.
Should a participating country subsequently fail to abide by its commitments, the EFA could impose a fine or other penalty, which would be proportionate to the violation, thereby preventing enforcement from becoming a nuclear option that can never be exercised.
This would provide strong protection against moral hazard.
A successor government in, say, Italy, would find it practically impossible to break any commitments undertaken by Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s current administration.
With practically half of Italy’s debt financed by European Treasury Bills – producing an effect similar to a reduction in the average maturity of its debt – a successor government would be all the more responsive to any punishment imposed by the EFA.
After a suitable period, the participating countries would enter into debt-reduction programs tailored in a way that does not jeopardize their growth.
This would be the prelude to the establishment of a full political union and the introduction of Eurobonds.
Of course, the issuance of European Treasury bills would require the approval of the Bundestag, but it would be in conformity with the German Constitutional Court’s requirement that any commitment approved by the Bundestag be limited in time and size.
It is not too late to turn this proposal into a political declaration that outlines not only the long-term goal of a political union, but also a road map toward a fiscal and banking union.
Guided by this declaration, the eurozone’s financial-rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), could immediately take over the ECB’s holdings of Greek bonds; the ECB could start accumulating Spanish and Italian bonds; and Italy and Spain could implement the structural reforms needed to qualify for the Debt Redemption Fund.
This agenda would bring immense relief to the financial markets.
Equally important, it would change Europe’s political dynamics from negative to positive.
The main obstacle is that German politicians remain mired in a “can’t do” mode.
Merkel insists that a political union should precede a full-fledged fiscal and banking union.
That is both unrealistic and unreasonable.
The three have to be developed together, step-by-step.
There can be no treaty or constitutional clause preventing the establishment of the EFA if the German electorate, as represented by the Bundestag, approves it; otherwise, the ESM could not have been created.
If the rest of Europe is united behind this proposal, and the Bundestag rejects it, Germany must take full responsibility for the financial and political consequences.
How France Will Reform
PARIS – The world is changing rapidly – and it will not wait for anyone.
The only way to thrive is to keep pace with this transformation.
That is why France is pursuing reforms.
Of course, reform means change.
But it does not mean giving in to external pressure, or giving up what makes France French.
Rather, it is the key to consolidating our history, our pride, our traditions, our way of life, and our values in a dynamic global environment, for the sake of today’s citizens and tomorrow’s.
It is the key to building a stronger, more prosperous France.
Clearly, much is at stake in the ongoing reform process.
The good news is that many factors work in France’s favor, including diverse geography, a vibrant science and technology sector, a rich culture, and vast human capital.
Indeed, these factors help to explain why France remains the world’s fifth-largest economy.
But, as globalization transforms the world economy, France must adapt in order to enable its businesses to compete abroad as well as at home.
A robust business sector is decisive in an open economy, as it shapes a country’s ability to preserve – and improve – its citizens’ living standards.
That is why everything possible must be done to enable France to create more and better wealth.
By helping French businesses recover lost margins, we can empower them to invest and create employment.
That is precisely what the “responsibility pact,” which came into force on January 1, and the tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs aim to do.
As we help French businesses to expand abroad, we must also work to encourage inward foreign investment.
Both are key to a country’s commercial attractiveness – among the most important dimensions of global competition.
This stronger France will tackle whatever challenges the world throws at it head on.
At the same time, it will demonstrate its capacity to eliminate drags on creativity and wealth creation.
The “law on growth and activity” that will be voted on this year will unleash the business sector’s energy, including by stimulating competition.
Moreover, opening up regulated professions will help to reduce the inequalities with which the French public has become increasingly frustrated.
To create more wealth in an open economy is one of my government’s priorities.
But more wealth alone will not cure France’s ills.
The most successful countries are those where employers and employees feel bound to a common fate.
It is thus urgent to improve social dialogue and bolster trust in France.
This objective underlies our “simplification schemes” for negotiation and consultation in the business sector.
And it is helping to guide vocational education and training reform, which will benefit not only those who wish to enhance their skills at work, but also those whose lack of training is preventing them from finding employment.
These initiatives are just part of a broader shift.
Through a variety of mechanisms, we are working to make citizens’ lives easier, streamline business activities, and relieve the authorities of extraneous work that diverts attention from important strategic tasks.
French citizens will soon begin to feel the impact of these efforts in their daily lives.
Despite the tremendous potential of these initiatives, they will be for naught if they are not perceived as being fair.
France, after all, has long been defined by a strong egalitarian impulse.
Consider education.
In reworking our “priority education” program, we can adjust teaching methods to address school inequalities, while channeling additional resources to disadvantaged areas.
This includes ensuring that all schools have enough computers, so that all students can benefit from today’s technological breakthroughs, with no digital divide among students or regions.
The fact that the impact will not be felt for years should not be allowed to diminish its urgency.
Indeed, the entire process of building a strong and equitable economy should aim not just to improve citizens’ lives today; it must also prepare France for the future.
And, when it comes to boosting a country’s long-term prospects, the most successful initiatives often take time to produce visible results.
In a society that overvalues immediacy, it can be difficult to take a long-term view.
But my government will not be deterred from forward-thinking action that will ensure that tomorrow’s France is the France our citizens want and deserve.
It is up to the state to set an example for reform.
This is all the more true in France, where citizens place high expectations on the state – not to do everything, but certainly to draw strategic lines and enable local actors to succeed.
In short, the government must put its agenda-setting power at the service of the people.
When it comes to preparing for the future, one exceptionally large project lies ahead: the energy transition.
We all know that we are headed toward a new growth model – one that is more sober and sustainable, that depends less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources.
This new approach to growth will entail new habits, new attitudes, and new modes of living.
With the energy transition law, my government aims to get ahead of this trend by creating the legislative framework for future “green” growth.
The goals of the French government’s reform agenda are clear: A stronger France, able to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment; a fairer France, without which no effort, whether individual or collective, could be considered a success; and a more steadfast France that can serve as a stable and prosperous home for our children.
In the interest of France and its people, we are committed to the reforms needed to realize this vision.
How India Survived the Financial Crisis
NEW DELHI – As the world economy begins to recover, Indians are looking back with particular satisfaction at how they coped with the recent crisis.
Despite an unprecedented global recession, India remained the second fastest growing economy in the world.
Whereas most countries suffered negative growth in at least one quarter over the last two years, India’s GDP grew by more than 6% throughout this period – and by 7.9% in the last quarter of 2009.
India’s achievement is all the more striking given that the Pakistani terrorist attacks on Mumbai – India’s financial nerve center and commercial capital – in late November 2008 came in the midst of the crisis.
The terrorists dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant, a success story of the era of globalization, and a magnet for investors and tourists.
Indeed, in late 2008, foreign investors did withdraw $12 billion from India’s stock markets. But India’s resilience in the face of adversity, and its mature restraint in the face of violent provocation, encouraged investors to return.
Foreign direct investment totaled $27.3 billion in 2008-2009, despite the global financial crisis, and reached $1 billion in just one week in May 2009.
India’s ability to stave off the economic gales was helped by the fact that it is much less dependent than most countries on global flows of trade and capital.
India relies on external trade for about 20% of its GDP (the figure for China is roughly double). The country’s large and robust internal market accounts for the rest.
Indians continued producing goods and services for other Indians, and that kept the economy humming.
Though India’s merchandise exports did register declines of about 30%, its exports of services continued to do well throughout the crisis.
Indians abroad stayed loyal to India: remittances from overseas Indians remained robust, reaching $46.4 billion in 2008-2009, the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries.
India’s generally conservative financial system played a vital role, too.
Its banks and financial institutions were not tempted to buy the mortgage-supported securities and credit-default swaps that ruined several Western financial institutions.
Among the drivers of growth, domestic capital formation retained much of its momentum from preceding years.
Moreover, India’s government adopted a pro-active fiscal policy, rolling out two rounds of stimulus packages.
The authorities pursued pro-growth policies, including lower interest rates, expanded credit, and a reduction in excise duties.
There are still challenges ahead.
Reform is pursued hesitantly by a coalition government constantly wary of voters’ reactions.
A decision to de-regulate petrol and diesel prices has sparked massive street protests and stoked fears of rampant inflation.
Privatization of India’s bloated public sector (from massive coal and steel enterprises to the loss-making national carrier Air India) has been slow to get off the ground.
And, of course, the persistent complaints of corruption and bureaucratic red tape have not faded with liberalization.
The country’s infrastructure remains woeful, as any visitor flying into an Indian airport notices. Power shortages are frequent.
Some 40% of the population still lives below a poverty line drawn just this side of the funeral pyre.
Yet all these problems are being dealt with by a confident Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has steered the ship of state through some particularly treacherous waters.
India is simultaneously tackling the “hardware” of development (ports, roads, airports) and its “software” (health care, education).
Success will not occur overnight, but progress has been impressive and is continuing.
In the last 15 years, India has pulled more people out of poverty than in the previous 45 – roughly 10 million people per year on average in the last decade.
The country has visibly prospered, and, despite population growth, per capita income has grown faster, and to a greater level, than ever before.
The current financial crisis, far from prompting India to retreat, is an opportunity to safeguard and build on those gains.
India can advance with the confidence that it can cope with the world from a very secure base.
As the 2010 monsoon nourishes India’s plains, that’s an encouraging place to be.
How Inequality Fueled the Crisis
CHICAGO – Before the recent financial crisis, politicians on both sides of the aisle in the United States egged on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-backed mortgage agencies, to support low-income lending in their constituencies.
There was a deeper concern behind this newly discovered passion for housing for the poor: growing income inequality.
Since the 1970’s, wages for workers at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution in the US –such as office managers – have grown much faster than wages for the median worker (at the 50th percentile), such as factory workers and office assistants.
A number of factors are responsible for the growth in the 90/50 differential.
Perhaps the most important is that technological progress in the US requires the labor force to have ever greater skills.
A high school diploma was sufficient for office workers 40 years ago, whereas an undergraduate degree is barely sufficient today.
But the education system has been unable to provide enough of the labor force with the necessary education.
The reasons range from indifferent nutrition, socialization, and early-childhood learning to dysfunctional primary and secondary schools that leave too many Americans unprepared for college.
The everyday consequence for the middle class is a stagnant paycheck and growing job insecurity.
Politicians feel their constituents’ pain, but it is hard to improve the quality of education, for improvement requires real and effective policy change in an area where too many vested interests favor the status quo.
Moreover, any change will require years to take effect, and therefore will not address the electorate’s current anxiety.
Thus, politicians have looked for other, quicker ways to mollify their constituents.
We have long understood that it is not income that matters, but consumption.
A smart or cynical politician would see that if somehow middle-class households’ consumption kept up, if they could afford a new car every few years and the occasional exotic holiday, perhaps they would pay less attention to their stagnant paychecks.
Therefore, the political response to rising inequality – whether carefully planned or the path of least resistance – was to expand lending to households, especially low-income households. The benefits – growing consumption and more jobs – were immediate, whereas paying the inevitable bill could be postponed into the future.
Cynical as it might seem, easy credit has been used throughout history as a palliative by governments that are unable to address the deeper anxieties of the middle class directly.
Politicians, however, prefer to couch the objective in more uplifting and persuasive terms than that of crassly increasing consumption.
In the US, the expansion of home ownership – a key element of the American dream – to low- and middle-income households was the defensible linchpin for the broader aims of expanding credit and consumption.
Why did the US not follow the more direct path of redistribution, of taxing or borrowing and spending on the anxious middle class?
Greece, for example, got into trouble doing precisely this, employing many thousands in the government and overpaying them, even while it ran up public debt to astronomical levels.
In the US, though, there have been strong political forces arrayed against direct redistribution in recent years.
Directed housing credit was a policy with broader support, because each side thought that it would benefit.
The left favored flows to their natural constituency, while the right welcomed new property owners who could, perhaps, be convinced to switch party allegiance.
More low-income housing credit has been one of the few issues on which President Bill Clinton’s administration, with its affordable-housing mandate, and that of President George W. Bush, with its push for an “ownership” society, agreed.
In the end, though, the misguided attempt to push home ownership through credit has left the US with houses that no one can afford and households drowning in debt.
Ironically, since 2004, the homeownership rate has been in decline.
The problem, as often is the case with government policies, was not intent.
It rarely is.
But when lots of easy money pushed by a deep-pocketed government comes into contact with the profit motive of a sophisticated, competitive, and amoral financial sector, matters get taken far beyond the government’s intent.
This is not, of course, the first time in history that credit expansion has been used to assuage the concerns of a group that is being left behind, nor will it be the last.
In fact, one does not even need to look outside the US for examples.
The deregulation and rapid expansion of banking in the US in the early years of the twentieth century was in many ways a response to the Populist movement, backed by small and medium-sized farmers who found themselves falling behind the growing numbers of industrial workers, and demanded easier credit.
Excessive rural credit was one of the important causes of bank failures during the Great Depression.
The broader implication is that we need to look beyond greedy bankers and spineless regulators (and there were plenty of both) for the root causes of this crisis.
And the problems are not solved with a financial regulatory bill entrusting more powers to those regulators.
America needs to tackle inequality at its root, by giving more Americans the ability to compete in the global marketplace. This is much harder than doling out credit, but more effective in the long run.
How Japan Fuels Global Financial Instability
Over the past several years, much attention has focused on the role of China’s trade surplus in creating today’s global financial imbalances.
But too little attention has been paid to the role of Japan’s policy of near-zero interest rates in contributing to these imbalances.
As global financial uncertainty rises, it is time for Japan to change course.
Japan’s ultra-low interest rate policy was initiated in the 1990’s to put a floor under the economy following the bursting of its asset price bubble.
However, over time these ultra-low interest rates have promoted a highly speculative financial “carry” trade: speculators borrow yen at low interest rates and then buy dollars and other currencies that are invested in higher-yield assets elsewhere.
There are two key features of this carry trade.
First, it contributes to yen depreciation and dollar appreciation as carry traders switch out of yen.
Second, it increases global asset demand, generating asset price inflation.
The yen’s depreciation versus the dollar has contributed to continuing large US trade deficits with Japan.
It has also pressured other East Asian countries to under-value their exchange rates in order to remain competitive with Japan.
Given China’s under-valued currency, East Asia’s two largest economies have thus anchored down exchange rates throughout the region, thereby increasing the region’s trade surplus at the expense of jobs and growth in the rest of the global economy.
Funds switched out of Japan have shifted to other financial markets, with the chase for yield driving up asset prices and lowering interest rates.
In the US, this has complicated the Federal Reserve’s task.
The Fed has been trying to slow demand growth and cool the housing price bubble to avoid inflation, but carry trade speculators have been easing credit.
Most importantly, the carry trade generates global financial fragility by creating fundamental – and dangerous –mismatches.
First, carry traders borrow in yen but invest in dollars and other currencies.
Second, carry traders borrow short-term money in Japan but may invest in longer-term assets outside Japan.
Unexpected yen appreciation could cause large carry trade exchange rate losses, as could unexpected closing of the interest rate gap with Japan.
Such losses, or just the thought of them, have the potential to trigger global contagion as carry traders close positions in US markets to repay loans in Japan.
In addition to the global dangers of the carry trade, the policy of ultra-low interest rates may also be bad for Japan.
This is because ultra-low interest rates may hurt Japan’s households and lower consumption, and this effect may be larger than the benefit that a weak yen confers on Japan’s exports.
Higher interest rates can spur consumption if their impact on income outweighs the increased incentive to save.
This may well be the case for Japan, which has a rapidly aging population.
Current ultra-low interest rates may be scaring people about the adequacy of future income.
Raising rates could alleviate those fears, increasing consumer confidence and spending.
Additionally, raising interest rates would be a form of expansionary fiscal policy.
This is because Japan has a large public debt, and increasing interest payments on that debt would put extra money in the hands of households.
The policy of ultra-low interest rates was justified in the aftermath of the bursting of Japan’s asset price bubble, but Japan stabilized its economy long ago.
At this stage, the policy has become a contributor to global financial fragility, and it may be retarding Japan’s own prosperity by contributing to consumer anxieties.
That means Japan should decisively abandon ultra-low interest rates, albeit gradually so as to allow an orderly unwinding of speculative positions.
How Long for Low Rates?
CAMBRIDGE – How long can today’s record-low, major-currency interest rates persist?
Ten-year interest rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany have all been hovering around the once unthinkable 1.5% mark.
In Japan, the ten-year rate has drifted to below 0.8%.
Global investors are apparently willing to accept these extraordinarily low rates, even though they do not appear to compensate for expected inflation.
Indeed, the rate on inflation-adjusted US Treasury bills (so-called “TIPS”) is now negative up to 15 years.
Is this extraordinary situation stable?
In the very near term, certainly; indeed, interest rates could still fall further.
Over the longer term, however, this situation is definitely not stable.
Three major factors underlie today’s low yields.
First and foremost, there is the “global savings glut,” an idea popularized by current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 2005 speech.
For various reasons, savers have become ascendant across many regions.
In Germany and Japan, aging populations need to save for retirement.
In China, the government holds safe bonds as a hedge against a future banking crisis and, of course, as a byproduct of efforts to stabilize the exchange rate.
Similar motives dictate reserve accumulation in other emerging markets.
Finally, oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seek to set aside wealth during the boom years.
Second, in their efforts to combat the financial crisis, the major central banks have all brought down very short-term policy interest rates to close to zero, with no clear exit in sight.
In normal times, any effort by a central bank to take short-term interest rates too low for too long will boomerang.
Short-term market interest rates will fall, but, as investors begin to recognize the ultimate inflationary consequences of very loose monetary policy, longer-term interest rates will rise.
This has not yet happened, as central banks have been careful to repeat their mantra of low long-term inflation.
That has been sufficient to convince markets that any stimulus will be withdrawn before significant inflationary forces gather.
But a third factor has become manifest recently.
Investors are increasingly wary of a global financial meltdown, most likely emanating from Europe, but with the US fiscal cliff, political instability in the Middle East, and a slowdown in China all coming into play.
Meltdown fears, even if remote, directly raise the premium that savers are willing to pay for bonds that they perceive as the most reliable, much as the premium for gold rises.
These same fears are also restraining business investment, which has remained muted, despite extremely low interest rates for many companies.
It is the combination of all three of these factors that has created a “perfect storm” for super low interest rates.
But how long can the storm last?
Although highly unpredictable, it is easy to imagine how the process could be reversed.
For starters, the same forces that led to an upward shift in the global savings curve will soon enough begin operating in the other direction.
Japan, for example, is starting to experience a huge retirement bulge, implying a sharp reduction in savings as the elderly start to draw down lifetime reserves.
Japan’s past predilection toward saving has long implied a large trade and current-account surplus, but now these surpluses are starting to swing the other way.
Germany will soon be in the same situation.
Meanwhile, new energy-extraction technologies, combined with a softer trajectory for global growth, are having a marked impact on commodity prices, cutting deeply into the surpluses of commodity exporters from Argentina to Saudi Arabia.
Second, many (if not necessarily all) central banks will eventually figure out how to generate higher inflation expectations.
They will be driven to tolerate higher inflation as a means of forcing investors into real assets, to accelerate deleveraging, and as a mechanism for facilitating downward adjustment in real wages and home prices.
It is nonsense to argue that central banks are impotent and completely unable to raise inflation expectations, no matter how hard they try.
In the extreme, governments can appoint central bank leaders who have a long-standing record of stating a tolerance for moderate inflation – an exact parallel to the idea of appointing “conservative” central bankers as a means of combating high inflation.
Third, eventually the clouds over Europe will be resolved, though I admit that this does not seem likely to happen anytime soon.
Indeed, things will likely get worse before they get better, and it is not at all difficult to imagine a profound restructuring of the eurozone.
Nevertheless, whichever direction the euro crisis takes, its ultimate resolution will end the extreme existential uncertainty that clouds the outlook today.
Ultra-low interest rates may persist for some time.
Certainly Japan’s rates have remained stable at an extraordinarily low level for a considerable period, at times falling further even as it seemed that they could only rise.
But today’s low interest-rate dynamic is not an entirely stable one.
It could unwind remarkably quickly.
How Military Should Japan Be?
Is it time for Japan to prime its weapons and sail out into the world in defense of peace?
The very idea still incites howls of protest in Asia - not least in Japan, where popular attachment to the country's postwar "peace" constitution remains powerful.
Yet Japan's modestly named Self-Defense Forces are involved in many regional hot spots (no combat duty, of course) and seek to play a more active part in UN peacekeeping.
If a shooting war ever breaks out in Asia, Japan is nowadays prepared to do a lot more than fill the petrol tanks.
It is past time for these modest changes, because the Asia/Pacific region's many fault lines affect the interests of the world's great and emerging powers in fundamental ways.
Northeast Asia contains the last remnants of the Cold War: the divided Korean Peninsula and hostile glares across the Taiwan Straits.
Southeast Asia forms its own unique geo-political environment, with a wide variety of ethnic groups, cultures, and religions in tension - as the current Islamic unrest in Thailand attests.
Beyond these conventional strategic concerns, the emergence of global terrorism and the Iraq War re-enforce Japan's sense that the strategic environment has changed profoundly.
The roles and obligations of the Self-Defense Forces must gradually shift and diversify, and their zone of action broadened.
Neat binary concepts like "peacetime" and "wartime" are no longer viable.
The world must get used to a twilight security environment of sudden and peripheral emergencies.
Japan's laws are primed for this change, because the obligations of the Self-Defense Forces are relatively clear in these circumstances.
The "Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law" allows the Self-Defense Forces to participate in the fight against international terrorism, although the form of participation is limited to logistical support.
Nor are the Self-Defense Forces' operations and obligations any longer restricted to Japanese territory and the adjacent seas.
Ever since Japan dispatched minesweepers to the Persian Gulf after the Gulf War in 1991, the Self-Defense Forces have been expanding their activities beyond Japan and its immediate vicinity to include international peacekeeping missions, emergency relief operations, multilateral military exercises, and naval refueling support in the Indian Ocean.
Self-Defense Force units have been dispatched to southern Iraq to provide humanitarian aid and support reconstruction efforts.
Of course, the obligation of the Self-Defense Forces not to engage in offensive combat operations remains unchanged.
With its expanded roles, however, the Self-Defense Forces are well prepared to engage in other military operations, such as shadowing and chasing spy ships, anti-terror activities, and missions to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.
Japan's warships can help with sanctions monitoring and minesweeping.
Its ships and aircraft can rescue stranded nationals.
But these incremental changes in Japan's military capacity and policies, though necessary and effective, can be sustained only with a clear national consensus on the country's defense interests.
The international community's demand that Japan participate directly in resolving global tensions has helped, by changing the terms of domestic debate.
The old deadlock on security issues is relaxing, and the Japanese public, recognizing the changed international environment, mostly embraces the Self-Defense Forces' deployment in pursuit of international and regional responsibilities.
Every Japanese citizen may have his or her own opinion, but a clear majority appear to agree that Japan must become a prominent nation in promoting international and regional security, as well as economic growth.
To achieve these ends, Japan must be endowed with responsibilities equivalent to the country's national power, while securing the safety, comfort, and prosperity of Japan and preserving the people's identity as Japanese with pride and honor.
Achieving these goals requires fulfilling several conditions.
Japan's political leadership needs to be founded on a competitive but stable political structure.
Only a truly popular political mandate can assure that the Japanese people are fully aware of their international responsibilities as an influential nation in the international community.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi seems to grasp much of this, and so is undertaking discussions on security and defense that aim to help revise the "National Defense Program Outline."
Those with bitter memories of Japanese behavior half a century ago should be reassured; this debate is about how to defend peace, not about how to promote or wage war.
Many of Japan's neighbors were understandably reassured by the Cold War arrangement whereby America promised to defend Japan, relieving the country of the need for a powerful military.
The one-sided nature of this alliance rankled little when Japan was just one among many protected by America's global shield.
As Japan prospered under America's protection, it prided itself on being a "civilian" power, using its trade and aid, rather than tanks and guns, to encourage stability.
But America, in its global war on terror, has justifiably lost interest in bearing Asia's many military burdens alone.
Hence, Japan must be seen to be doing more to support its inseparable ally, as well as international peacekeeping efforts in general.
A rich and powerful Japan in a region as dangerous as East Asia cannot go on playing military bit parts forever.
The question is whether Japan's Self-Defense Forces work alongside America and the world in defense of world peace now, or eventually do so alone in defense of Japan.
How Musharraf Survives
The devastating Kashmir earthquake is once again testing the skills of one of the world’s great political survivors.
General Pervez Musharraf, president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, has few friends and many enemies.
Pakistan’s major political parties oppose him.
For the religious right and the mullahs, he is an agent of America, the great Satan, and has thus betrayed the cause of Islam.
Somewhere out there, gunning for Musharraf, are Islamic militants furious at being dumped after they fought his covert wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir.
Many in Musharraf’s own army despise him for the same reason.
For Pakistan’s small and embattled liberal and left-wing forces, he is yet another military dictator who seized and holds power by force, undermining the development of democracy.
So how does Musharraf survive?
In large part, he can thank 9/11.
Faced by a United States bent upon bloody vengeance, Pakistan’s military establishment scurried to join the US-led coalition and take up arms against its own creation, the Taliban.
Only a few senior officers with an Islamic bent resisted this straightforward betrayal.
They were soon marginalized, drawing praise from Washington.
With US help, an economy that had nearly run aground was suddenly righted by a wave of international aid and loan write-offs.
Even more important was a decision, taken in the hope of choking off funds to extremist groups, to require all expatriate Pakistani earnings to be remitted through official banking channels.
In a curious way, nuclear weapons also are crucial to Musharraf’s survival, for they create conditions that distract Pakistan’s highly ideological army from its objective of war with India.
The dispute over Kashmir had occupied the minds of military planners throughout Pakistan’s history, and war had been the raison d’etre for maintaining the world’s eighth-largest standing army.
But nukes, a belief in deterrence, and the growing realization that Kashmir is a lost cause, have freed the army from the hard life of the trenches.
Ideology is increasingly irrelevant as the officer class scrambles to build vast personal fortunes.
A look at Pakistan’s economic landscape says it all.
The CEO’s of many, if not most corporations, public and private, are retired military officers – many fairly young.
The military owns airlines and freight companies, petrochemical factories, power generation plants, sugar mills, cement and fertilizer plants, construction firms, banks and insurance companies, advertising agencies, and more.
Vast tracts of prime real estate in cities, sold to officers for a pittance, have turned into mega housing developments.
Musharraf defends the military acquisitions, claiming that they are economically efficient, and angrily dismisses criticism as the ranting of unpatriotic Pakistani pseudo-intellectuals.
But they are “efficient” only in the sense that they dampen the threat to Musharraf posed by the military.
No so Pakistan’s Islamists, however, whom Musharraf infuriated yet again last month, when he ordered his foreign minister to initiate the first official contact with Israel.
But the Islamists’ call for nationwide protests flopped.
The military, after decades of rule, has dismantled all forms of political organization – parties, trade unions, and student associations – leaving a Pakistani society immobilized, apathetic, and incapable of articulating its preferences.
As Islamists’ anger at Musharraf’s betrayals increases, so does his global standing and image as a world statesman.
Scenes of wild-eyed mullahs demonstrating in the streets of Pakistani cities are a boon to his position.
Surely the Pakistani public needs to be tamed by a strongman.
No harm if it is an army general.
But the truth is more complex.
Musharraf flits effortlessly between personae.
At one moment he is the “responsible” world leader who speaks charmingly to the international media about moderate Islam; at the next, he is the cunning conspirator who rigs elections, destroys political opponents, breaks promises on relinquishing power, enters into mutually beneficial relationships with mullahs, and castigates human-rights activists as “Westernized fringe elements” that “are as bad as the Islamic extremists.”
To forestall the possibility of a coup, the army is being cleansed of hardline Islamists.
Soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty.
This process has deepened pro- and anti- US divisions within the army, both among commissioned and non-commissioned officers, but nothing in Pakistan today suggests that radical change is imminent.
To be sure, more incidents of global terrorism associated with Pakistan, such as July’s London bombings, will bring new pressures.
The US and Europe will make their usual demands to close down the country’s hate-spewing madrassas, and to reform a public-school system that, unhindered by the government, churns out young militants burning to kill and die for Islam.
For Musharraf, this means that continuing to hunt with the hounds and run with the hares might get harder.
But the current constellation of forces suggests that, barring unforeseen developments, his survival instincts will serve him well for years to come.
How New is Egypt’s “New” Foreign Policy?
CAIRO – In the months since Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation, his successors have signaled a shift in foreign policy by reaching out to former adversaries. Egypt’s government has welcomed Iranian diplomats and embraced the Palestinian group Hamas. Many interpret such moves as clear evidence of Egypt’s desire for a diplomacy that is not subordinate to American interests.
But Mubarak never entirely fit his detractors’ portrayal of him as an American lackey. In fact, Mubarak’s need to please his Saudi Arabian benefactors, not the United States, was paramount in his thinking. Although he sometimes supported American policies, Mubarak frequently rebuffed the US when its positions did not align with his own.
Since the end of the October 1973 war, Arab-Israeli peace has been a cornerstone of America’s Middle East agenda. The US often looked to Egypt, the most important and influential Arab country, to play a leading role in promoting this goal. And, when it suited him, Mubarak played his part. When the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat humiliated Mubarak before the US secretary of state and the international media by refusing to sign an annex to an Israeli-Palestinian accord brokered in Cairo, Mubarak told him, “Sign it, you son of a dog!”
On the other hand, when Arab public opinion opposed Palestinian concessions, Mubarak remained aloof from US peace initiatives. For example, in 1996, he declined President Bill Clinton’s invitation to come to Washington, along with Arafat and the leaders of Israel and Jordan, to settle a bout of Palestinian violence. And when Clinton asked Mubarak to pressure Arafat to facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal during negotiations at Camp David in 2000, he refused.
Mubarak had a rocky relationship with Israel, and held America’s closest Middle East ally at arm’s length throughout his presidency. For almost ten of his 30 years in office, Egypt had no ambassador in Tel Aviv. Mubarak never made an official state visit to Israel, and he frequently refused Israeli prime ministers’ requests to come to Cairo. When the US sought to extend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994, Mubarak mobilized the Arab world against the initiative, because Israel refused to sign the NPT.
Instead, Mubarak’s relationship with the Saudis usually determined his foreign policy. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and threatened to attack Saudi Arabia, Mubarak quickly dispatched troops to defend the kingdom. He was keen to support the Saudis and their Persian Gulf allies, who provided him with a steady flow of aid and an outlet for surplus Egyptian labor.
Though Mubarak’s opposition to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1991 happened to align with US policy, he was unwilling to back other American campaigns against Arab leaders. When President Ronald Reagan���s deputy national security adviser, John Poindexter, asked Mubarak to launch a joint US-Egyptian attack against Libya in 1985, the Egyptian president scolded his visitor, saying, “Look, Admiral, when we decide to attack Libya, it will be our decision and on our timetable.”
Mubarak again refused to acquiesce in US plans to isolate Libya in the 1990’s for its involvement in the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Instead of ostracizing Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Mubarak welcomed him to Cairo. After the United Nations imposed an international flight ban against Libya in 1992, its land crossings with Egypt proved crucial to Libya’s economy (and possibly Qaddafi’s political survival). Libya withstood the sanctions in part by importing food and oil infrastructure supplies via Egypt, and by exporting petroleum and steel with Mubarak’s help.
In fact, Mubarak’s Libya policy was driven largely by economic and security concerns, and rarely took US interests into consideration. More than one million Egyptians worked in Libya, which was also a large export market. And Qaddafi was eager to help Mubarak subdue Islamist threats to the Egyptian regime. Unlike neighboring Sudan, which harbored Egyptian radicals, like al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who were bent on destabilizing the country, Libya turned them over to Mubarak.
While Qaddafi delivered terrorists to Mubarak, the Egyptian president declined American requests to do the same. After Palestinians in 1985 hijacked the Italian ship Achille Lauro, killed an American, and berthed in Egypt, the US asked Mubarak to extradite them. But Mubarak refused, saying that Secretary of State George Shultz was “crazy” if he believed that Egypt would betray the Palestinian cause.
Egypt’s new leaders have inherited Mubarak’s dilemma – how to realize the country’s aspiration to lead the Arab world without angering its Saudi benefactors. For this reason, the Egyptian-Iranian rapprochement will yield more photo opportunities than tangible results. On opposite sides of religious and ethnic divides, a close bilateral relationship would seem unlikely under even the best circumstances. And, with Egypt in need of massive financial aid to offset the economic losses caused by its February revolution, its leaders can ill afford to alienate the Saudis, who view Iran, not Israel, as the gravest threat to regional stability.
Egypt is entering a new era. But the radical policy upheavals predicted by analysts will prove to be small tremors. Saudi interests will continue to weigh heavily on Egyptian foreign policy.
And that, above all, means preserving the status quo.
America’s Fiscal Cliff Dwellers
WASHINGTON, DC – In early 2012, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke used the term “fiscal cliff” to grab the attention of lawmakers and the broader public.
Bernanke’s point was that Americans should worry about the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts that are currently scheduled to begin at the end of this year.
But there is not really any kind of “cliff” in the sense that if you stepped over the edge, you would fall fast, land on something hard, and not get up for a long time.
In the modern US economy, the scheduled changes constitute more of a fiscal “slope” – meaning that the full effect of the tax increases would not be felt immediately (income withholding takes time to adjust), while the spending cuts would also be phased in (the government has some discretion regarding implementation).
This slope offers President Barack Obama a real opportunity to restore the federal government’s revenue base to what it was in the mid-1990’s.
The choice of words to describe America’s fiscal situation matters, given the hysteria that has been whipped up in recent months, primarily by people who want to make big cuts in the country’s two main entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare.
Their logic is that if we are about to rush off a cliff, we need to take extreme measures.
And cutting pensions and health care for the elderly certainly qualifies as extreme – as well as completely inappropriate and unnecessary.
If, instead, the US faces a fiscal slope, then people who refuse to consider raising taxes – namely, Republicans in the US Congress’s House of Representatives – have a very weak hand indeed.
It has become clear that the House Republicans will steadfastly refuse to vote for any increases in tax rates during the current lame-duck congressional session.
House Speaker John Boehner, who offered relatively conciliatory remarks immediately after the election, now says that he would accept higher revenue with lower rates – precisely what the temporary tax cuts enacted by George W. Bush’s administration were supposed to deliver, but manifestly did not.
It is very unlikely that congressional Democrats and Republicans can reach an agreement on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class, while allowing them to expire for the rich.
They will spar with each other for another six weeks, then go to the brink of the purported “cliff” and see who blinks at the last moment.
The sensible course of action for Obama would be to step off the “cliff” by vetoing any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, which would then expire at the end of 2012.
Once tax rates were restored to their previous levels, Obama could present his own tax-cut package to Congress – for example, with a proposal in early January that provided greater benefit to lower-income Americans, as he promised during his re-election campaign.
These tax cuts should also be linked to the state of the economy, so that they would wind down as employment recovers (for example, to its level in 2007, relative to total population).
If the economy looks weaker than anticipated in early 2013, the proposed tax cuts could be larger (as long as they were phased out during the economic recovery).
This approach would significantly transform America’s longer-run fiscal prospects.
Then, as America heads steadily down the fiscal slope in early 2013, the House Republicans would have a choice.
Do they vote, week after week, against tax cuts that would help 100 million Americans, while the economy deteriorates around them?
Or do they embrace a deal that cuts taxes and tax rates relative to where they would be otherwise?
In effect, the House Republicans can be forced to sign onto a deal that both supports the economy and restores revenue to the level that prevailed before the disastrous experiment of Bushonomics.
Obama has already put spending cuts on the table – probably to a greater extent than would please his electoral base (he does have a tendency to do this).
The big question is whether the US can strengthen revenue in an appropriate manner that is consistent with renewed economic growth.
America should aim to return to the tax rates of the mid-1990’s, when the economy was booming and the federal budget was in much better shape.
But it should do this fully only once the economy has completely recovered.
Ordinarily, partisan political gridlock in Washington would prevent any such sensible change.
Fortunately, the fiscal slope gives Obama the opportunity to bring it about – and even to write some history in the process.
That means vetoing any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and then working to enact the Obama tax cuts.
How Obama Leads
CAMBRIDGE – Two years ago, Barack Obama was a first-term senator from a mid-western state who had declared his interest in running for the presidency.
Many people were skeptical that an African-American with a strange name and little national experience could win.
But as his campaign unfolded, he demonstrated that he possessed the powers to lead – both soft and hard.
Soft power is the ability to attract others, and the three key soft-power skills are emotional intelligence, vision, and communications.
In addition, a successful leader needs the hard-power skills of organizational and Machiavellian political capacity.
Equally important is the contextual intelligence that allows a leader to vary the mix of these skills in different situations to produce the successful combinations that I call “smart power.”
During his campaign, Obama demonstrated these skills in his calm response to crises, his forward-looking vision, and his superb organizational ability.
In addition, his contextual intelligence about world politics has been shaped from the bottom up with experience in Indonesia and Kenya, and his understanding of American politics was shaped from the bottom up as a community organizer in Chicago.
Obama continued to demonstrate these leadership skills in his almost flawless transition.
By selecting his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, as his Secretary of State, and reaching across party lines to retain Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense, he showed openness to strong subordinates.
In his inaugural address, he sounded the themes of smart power – a willingness “to extend an open hand to those who unclench their fists” – but also stressed themes of responsibility as Americans confront sobering economic problems.
Moreover, Obama has started his term in decisive fashion.
In his first weeks in office, he began to fulfill his campaign promises by outlining a massive economic stimulus plan, ordering the closure of the Guantánamo Bay prison, promoting new fuel-efficiency standards to save energy, giving an interview to Al Arabiya, and sending a top emissary to the Middle East.
George W. Bush once said that his role as leader was to be “the decider.”
But even if Bush had been better as a decider, people want something more in a leader.
We want someone who reinforces our identity and tells us who we are.
We judge leaders not only by the effectiveness of their actions, but also by the meanings that they create and teach. 
Most leaders feed upon the existing identity and solidarity of their groups.
But some leaders see moral obligations beyond their immediate group and educate their followers.
Nelson Mandela could easily have chosen to define his group as black South Africans and sought revenge for the injustices of Apartheid and his own imprisonment.
Instead, he worked tirelessly to expand the identity of his followers both by words and deeds.
When Obama was faced with a campaign crisis over incendiary racial remarks by his former pastor, he did not simply distance himself from the problem, but made use of the episode to deliver a speech that served to broaden the understanding and identities of both white and black Americans.
The crisis on September 11, 2001, produced an opportunity for Bush to express a bold new vision of foreign policy.
But he failed to produce a sustainable picture of America’s leadership role in the world.
A successful vision is one that combines inspiration with feasibility.
Bush failed to get that combination right. 
Obama will need to use both his emotional and contextual intelligence if he is to restore American leadership.
Contextual intelligence is the intuitive diagnostic skill that helps a leader align tactics with objectives to produce smart strategies in different situations.
A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that the world was a uni-polar American hegemony.
Neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the United States was so powerful that it could do whatever it wanted, and that others had no choice but to follow. 
This new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power – that is, the ability to affect others to get the outcomes one wants – in world politics.
The US may be the only superpower, but preponderance is not empire.
America can influence but not control other parts of the world.
Whether certain resources will produce power depends upon the context.
To understand power and its contexts in the world today, I have sometimes suggested the metaphor of a three-dimensional chess game.
On the top board of military power among countries, the US is the only superpower.
On the middle board of economic relations among countries, the world is already multipolar.
America cannot get the outcomes it wants in trade, antitrust, or other areas without the cooperation of the European Union, China, Japan, and others.
On the bottom board of transnational relations outside the control of governments – pandemics, climate change, the drug trade, or transnational terrorism, for example – power is chaotically distributed.
Nobody is in control. 
This is the complex world in which Obama takes up the mantle of leadership.
He inherits a global economic crisis, two wars in which US and allied troops are deployed, crises in the Middle East and South Asia, and a struggle against terrorism.
He will have to deal with this legacy and chart a new course at the same time.
He will have to make difficult decisions while creating a larger sense of meaning in which America once again exports hope rather than fear.
That will be the test of his leadership.
Oily Dirt
EDMONTON – Calm discussion of the environment nowadays is about as plausible as reasoned dialogue on witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts.
Consider the hyperbolic debate over the Keystone XL pipeline, which would funnel oil from Canada’s Athabasca tar sands in northeastern Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast.
The Alberta government – and the oil companies that influence it – would upgrade “tar sands” to “oil sands,” apparently thinking that a better name somehow silences environmental critics.
Environmentalists opposing the pipeline refer, with equal deftness, to “dirty oil.”
Bystanders understandably wonder which is worse – awkward rebranding or awkward puns.
Neither gaucherie is entirely deceptive.
The tar sands are hundreds of square kilometers of bitumen, a viscous and corrosive tarlike deposit.
Bitumen permeates the dirt at the surface or, where thin layers of compost and sediment intervene, somewhat below basement levels.
Grasping a handful of dirt from a riverbank does leave one’s hand more oily than tarred, and the greasy dirt is somewhat sandy.
This highlights the real deception by both sides.
Awkwardly for oil companies, bitumen is not ordinary oil.
Awkwardly for environmentalists, Nature put corrosive bitumen in the dirt.
Had BP spilled hundreds of billions of barrels of bitumen across hundreds of square kilometers, environmentalists would rightly demand that no expense be spared to rid the dirt of every trace of oil.
A double standard applies, because, whatever Nature does is, well, natural, and therefore good.
Environmentalists’ awkwardness is, or ought to be, disconcerting.
But oil companies’ awkwardness is more substantial. They remove bitumen from the dirt in two ways.
An older technology features vast strip mines, huge diggers, and trucks carting oily dirt to industrial-scale pressure cookers that drain off the bitumen.
A newer technology leaves the surface untouched by pumping steam into the subsoil.
This heats the bitumen, making it runny enough to be pumped out.
Both processes leave toxic residues and somewhat less oily dirt.
Environmentalists make several arguments for leaving the bitumen in the dirt.
They disparage hideous strip mines and toxic tailing ponds that even superstar marketers cannot “greenwash.” &#160;The scale is unusual, but open-pit mines and tailing ponds are normal mining operations everywhere.
Moreover, the newer bitumen technology does without strip mines.
Environmentalists correctly note that producing heat for either process uses more energy than does overcoming gravity to pump up ordinary oil.
Burning natural gas to heat oily dirt releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, exacerbating global warming.
Unfortunately, biodiesel from soy is little better on this count; and California heavy oil and farm ethanol are both far worse.
We are running a global experiment while living in a test tube.
Given this, the oil industry’s defense – “I’m no worse a scoundrel” – seems dishonorable.
US President Barack Obama has a limited opportunity to preserve the bitumen companies’ integrity.
They want to access the American market and use Gulf Coast ports to export more widely, but Keystone XL is not their only option.
If Obama blocks the pipeline, they will build others, and other export facilities – if not on Canada’s environmentally delicate Pacific coast, then at some already-industrialized Atlantic port.
These developments will come anyway, and, once they do, the United States will become a mere bystander.
By offering conditional approval of the Keystone XL, Obama could advance the pipeline’s very genuine diplomatic and economic benefits, while reducing its environmental costs.
The benefits are huge.
Flooding global markets with Canadian oil would constrain global oil prices. More important, it would advance the cause of peace.
Addiction to Middle East oil distorts foreign policies, causes wars, and ravages the environment.
Recall how Iraqi soldiers retreating from Kuwait in 1991 set hundreds of wellheads ablaze.
The infernos spewed CO2 into the air and flaming oil across delicate desert ecosystems for months.
War is not green.
America cannot realistically expect its allies – let alone countries like Iran and Venezuela, with which its relations are strained – to adopt principled foreign policies when Middle East Realpolitik distorts its own foreign policy.
In the short term, Canadian oil would liberate the US from this hypocrisy.
In the longer term, were shale gas and oil to satisfy US demand, Canadian oil could wean America’s allies from their Middle East oil addiction, giving them new foreign-policy options, too.
Obama’s approval should be conditional on Canada enforcing serious environmental safeguards.
Many bitumen companies claim that they already abide by such safeguards; but environmentalists’ skepticism is justified.
Competition presses each company to keep its costs down.
Only strong regulations, transparency, and severe penalties can create a level playing field.
One obvious condition is mandatory CO2 “sequestration” (removing CO2 from the air and storing it deep underground).
Mandatory sequestration could make net CO2 emissions from bitumen extraction no worse than those from conventional oil wells, and perhaps even better.
Another obvious condition is mandatory timetables for restoring strip mines and tailing ponds to their natural condition.
The companies want the bitumen that Nature put in the oily dirt.
Let them take it, but let’s also ensure they leave no worse a mess than Nature intended.
The Political Economy of 2013
NEWPORT BEACH – Watching America’s leaders scramble in the closing days of 2012 to avoid a “fiscal cliff” that would plunge the economy into recession was yet another illustration of an inconvenient truth: messy politics remains a major driver of economic developments.
In some cases during 2012, politics was a force for good: consider Prime Minister Mario Monti’s ability to pull Italy back from the brink of financial turmoil.
But, in other cases, like Greece, political dysfunction aggravated economic problems.
Close and defining linkages between politics and economics are likely to persist in 2013.
Having said this, we should also expect much greater segmentation in terms of impact – and that the consequences will affect both individual countries and the global system as a whole.
In some countries – for example, Italy, Japan, and the United States – politics will remain the primary driver of economic-policy approaches.
But elsewhere – China, Egypt, Germany, and Greece come to mind – the reverse will be true, with economics becoming a key determinant of political outcomes.
This duality in causation speaks to a world that will become more heterogeneous in 2013 – and in at least two ways: it will lack unifying political themes, and it will be subject to multi-speed growth and financial dynamics that imply a range of possible scenarios for multilateral policy interactions.
With an election looming in Italy, the country’s technocratic interim administration will return the reins of power to a democratically elected government.
The question, both for Italy and Europe as a whole, is whether the new government will maintain the current economic policy stance or shift to one that is less acceptable to the country’s external partners (particularly Germany and the European Central Bank).
Monti may or may not be involved in the new government.
The further removed from it he is, the greater the temptation will be to alter the policy approach in response to popular pressures.
This would involve less emphasis on fiscal and structural reforms, raising concerns in Berlin, Brussels, and Frankfurt.
Japan’s incoming government has already signaled an economic-policy pivot, relying on what it directly controls (fiscal policy), together with pressure on the Bank of Japan, to relax the monetary-policy stance, in an effort to generate faster growth and higher inflation.
In the process, officials are weakening the yen.
They will also try to lower Japan’s dependence on exports and rethink sending production facilities to lower-wage countries.
The economic impact of politics in the US, while important, will be less dynamic: absent a more cooperative Congress, politics will mute policy responses rather than fuel greater activism.
Continued congressional polarization would maintain policy uncertainty, confound debt and deficit negotiations, and impede economic growth.
From stymieing medium-term fiscal reforms to delaying needed overhauls of the labor and housing markets, congressional dysfunction would keep US economic performance below its capacity; over time, it would also eat away at potential output.
In other countries, the causal direction will run primarily from economics to politics.
In Egypt and Greece, for example, rising poverty, high unemployment, and financial turmoil could place governments under pressure.
Popular frustration may not wait for the ballot box.
Instead, hard times could fuel civil unrest, threatening their governments’ legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness – and with no obvious alternatives that could ensure rapid economic recovery and rising living standards.
In China, the credibility of the incoming leadership will depend in large part on whether the economy can consolidate its soft landing.
Specifically, any prolonged period of sub-7% growth could encourage opposition and dissent – not only in the countryside, but also in urban centers.
Then there is Germany, which holds the key to the integrity and unity of the eurozone.
So far, Chancellor Angela Merkel has been largely successful in insulating the German economy from the turmoil elsewhere in Europe.
Unemployment has remained remarkably low and confidence relatively high.
And, while growth has moderated recently, Germany remains one of Europe’s best-performing economies – and not just its paymaster.
While some would have favored greater policy activism, Merkel’s Germany has provided a steady anchor for a eurozone struggling to end bouts of financial instability and put an end to questions about its survival as a well-functioning monetary union (one that aspires to becoming much more).
A change in German leadership would, therefore, raise questions about Europe’s policy underpinning.
How politics and economics interact nationally and globally is one of the important questions for 2013 and beyond.
There are three scenarios: good economics and effective politics provide the basis for a growing and more cooperative global economy; bad economics interact with dysfunctional politics to ruin the day; or the world muddles through, increasingly unstable, as a tug of war between economics and politics plays out, with no clear result or direction.
Part of the answer depends on what happens in three countries in particular – China, Germany, and the US.
Their economic and political stability is essential to the well-being of a world economy that has yet to recover fully from the 2008 global financial crisis.
Current indications, albeit incomplete, suggest that the three will continue to anchor the global economy in 2013.
That is the good news.
The bad news is that their anchor may remain both tentative and insufficient to restore the level of growth and financial stability to which billions of people aspire.
The Siren Song of “Strongmania”
CLAREMONT – Political strongmen are back in style.
Not long ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the only leaders worthy of the label.
Today, he has much more competition.
The trend can be seen in traditionally autocratic regimes.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is arguably the country’s most powerful leader since the death of Mao Zedong four decades ago.
But something similar can be seen in countries that had been touted as model young democracies.
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had long been moving toward autocracy, has concentrated power further in the wake of last month’s failed military coup.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has reversed a post-communist success story with a sharp turn toward illiberalism.
Even in the Philippines, where the People Power Revolution overthrew Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, voters have just elected as their president Rodrigo Duterte, an avowed populist strongman and trigger-happy warrior against drug lords.
Even the world’s most stable democracies have been infected by strongmania.
In Austria, Norbert Hofer, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, is likely to be elected to the presidency in October.
And in the United States, Donald Trump has capitalized on the frustration and prejudices of parts of the American electorate to gain a chance – fortunately, weakening by the day – of becoming the country’s next president.
This embrace of leaders who promise that they alone can fix society’s problems and restore some idealized past reflects widespread ignorance of the nature and consequences of populist rule.
In fact, history has not been kind to such rulers.
Like today’s leaders, they would often ride to power on a wave of public anger against the perceived failures of democracy – failures that they had no intention of fixing.
Instead, once in office, they would often pursue an entirely different agenda – one that usually made things much worse.
One need look no further than Venezuela, where today’s economic meltdown can be traced back to the disastrous rule of populist par excellence Hugo Chávez.
People loved Chávez’s social-welfare schemes, seemingly unconcerned that they were based on oil revenues and foreign debt.
As long as the benefits flowed, Chávez was free to expropriate industries and otherwise discourage private competition.
Unsurprisingly, economic diversification stalled, and when oil prices collapsed, so did the economy.
This highlights a key reason why strongmen nearly always lead their countries toward catastrophe.
After winning over voters with their apparent decisiveness and directness, such leaders capture enough authority to make quick decisions and demonstrate short-term results – thereby keeping voters on their side as they claim still greater authority.
But decisiveness carries a high cost.
With nobody checking their behavior, strongmen rarely account for long-term risks.
In the end, the prosperity they promised never arrives, at least not for long.
Instead, the economy usually ends up in ruins.
And that’s not the worst of it.
Voters surrender freedoms for that promised prosperity, as Russia under Putin illustrates.
Putin promised stability and order, and consolidated his power by taking down his political opponents, liberals and oligarchs alike.
Then he began methodically destroying Russia’s fragile democratic institutions, stifling the press, and curtailing civil liberties, including freedom of assembly.
Less than a decade later, he had erected a personal autocratic regime on the ruins of a flawed new democracy.
And, as in Venezuela, the absence of economic modernization and diversification tied the economy’s fate to the global oil market.
The ability to criticize the government freely is the core difference between democracy and dictatorship.
So how can anyone believe that a leader who curtails people’s right to speak out can save a flawed democracy?
In fact, the combination of freedom of expression and electoral competition is the key to improving democracies, because it enables systemic failures – not to mention leaders’ missteps – to be subjected to public scrutiny.
China’s autocratic government is famous for avoiding such scrutiny by suppressing freedom of information.
Its many elements of Internet censorship – from blocking politically sensitive Wikipedia articles to filtering certain key words out of online searches – come together to form the so-called Great Firewall of China.
That firewall, together with press censorship, enables China’s leaders to conceal their failures and highlight their achievements, however dubious.
Putin behaves similarly, using the press to emphasize, say, how Russia’s annexation of Crimea has reminded the country’s Western opponents of its “greatness.”
Orbán and Erdoğan seem to be operating from the same playbook.
Moreover, like China, Russia has embraced extravagant spectacles like the Olympic Games, in an effort to showcase the country’s magnificence and the beneficence of its leaders.
Coverage of such events fills the media space that should be used to discuss serious governance issues.
If that were not enough to convince voters of the dangers posed by populist autocrats, one might also consider the human toll of living under their rule.
Perhaps the dozens of journalists who have been arrested in Turkey since the coup attempt, or the families of Putin’s many opponents who have ended up dead, could provide some insight into the cost of living in constant fear of the government.
The growing popularity of strongmen in much of the world may or may not herald the dawn of a new autocratic age.
Strongmen tend to self-destruct, owing to colossal mistakes that doom their grandiose ambitions.
Unfortunately, they tend to leave a severely compromised democracy and a derelict economy in their wake.
Ultimately, the best defense against such outcomes is to prevent populist autocrats from getting elected in the first place.
Countries that have elected such leaders should stand as a warning to others tempted to go down a similar path.
The Competition Factor
BRUSSELS/MEXICO CITY – Since the global economic downturn began in 2008, debate has centered on the macroeconomic strategies and instruments used to address the crisis and foster recovery.
But correcting imbalances and addressing short-term slowdowns or recessions, while important, should not be allowed to overshadow the need to establish long-term conditions for solid and sustainable economic growth.
So far, macroeconomic policy has borne both the blame for economic malaise and the hope that it can be overcome.
But we should be devoting as much attention to the microeconomic problems – such as poor incentives, market failures, and regulatory shortcomings – that led us into the crisis in the first place.
Indeed, just as microeconomic problems in the financial sector triggered a credit crunch and fueled a global recession, so microeconomic factors hold the key to recovery.
Many economies need to fix the financial sector and restore credit, while many more need to raise productivity in order to boost growth and create jobs.
Some industries suffer from counterproductive and ill-conceived regulation; others are ailing as a result of monopolistic behavior by dominant firms, or because they face a lack of effective competition and transparency in utilities and financial services.
Fixing these problems would help us to return to a path of growth and prosperity for all.
To achieve this, we first must follow the Hippocratic oath and avoid doing more harm.
Governments around the world should ignore the temptation to relax competition in order to provide relief to particular industries or economic groups.
The renowned American economist Mancur Olson argued that stagnation in developed economies results from cartels and lobbies becoming more numerous and powerful over time, until they eventually drain a country’s economic dynamism.
Preserving a competitive environment in which markets remain open and contestable is the best tonic, because firms must constantly innovate and perform better under such conditions.
This, in turn, makes our societies more creative and, ultimately, more prosperous.
Efforts to relax competition have many faces.
But all of them make an economy less productive and redistribute wealth to small, coordinated groups with vested interests and a strong inclination to lobby the government.
The most common approach is protectionism, which has been part of the political discourse in various countries in recent years.
But official measures to help national producers at the expense of domestic business customers and consumers are always short-sighted, for they fail to help producers to address the challenges that they will have to face sooner or later anyway.
Similarly, old-fashioned dirigisme – such as attempts to “pick winners,” foster national “champions,” or keep failed business models alive through state subsidies – is both harmful and doomed to fail.
And misplaced regulation – for example, in the service sector – remains a barrier to healthy competition in many countries.
Once we have stopped doing harm, we must start doing the right things.
Economic policy is like gardening: pulling on plants will not make them grow faster, but a successful gardener can provide them with the right environment in which to flourish.
Relying on competition can help societies to unleash well-functioning markets’ power to provide goods and services.
To achieve this, policymakers must have a sound enforcement framework at their disposal, take an economy-wide approach, and attract the participation of all stakeholders.
Sound enforcement implies legal tools and resources to pursue and implement an economic policy, along with an institutional design that reduces meddling by vested interests.
Consider, for example, the importance of impartial and effective antitrust authorities, or subsidy schemes that are sufficiently well designed to ensure that they truly serve the public interest.
An economy-wide approach is needed because markets are interconnected.
Misguided regulation or market failures that harm competition anywhere can burden the entire economy.
The global crisis erupted because major problems in the functioning of the banking sector had been left unaddressed.
The poor functioning of input markets, such as markets for energy or intermediary products, can also do a lot of economic harm, not least because it hampers external competitiveness.
Finally, strengthening competition throughout the economy requires broad support.
This cannot be achieved without bridging ideological divisions and overcoming political pressures from particular economic groups.
Advocacy can play a key role, by educating not only policymakers, but also citizens and businessmen, about the benefits of competition.
There should be a wide consensus that a pro-competitive environment is one of the keys to economic prosperity.
Australia provides a good example of how pro-competitive policies deliver results.
Its economy was one of the OECD’s worst in terms of productivity growth in the 1980’s; a decade later, Australia was in third place.
In the interim, all of the country’s economic regulation was examined from the standpoint of maximizing competition, and a national pro-reform consensus was forged.
Currently, significant efforts are underway in several countries, including Mexico.
Structural reforms to boost productivity will also be crucial to ensure Europe’s economic recovery and the survival of its social model.
The “Single Market Acts I &amp; II” provide a comprehensive agenda to tap fully the potential of an integrated and competitive market of 500 million consumers to catalyze growth and prosperity in the European Union.
We know from experience that competition works.
By basing economic policy on this experience, we could not only avert Olson’s grim prophecy. We could also accelerate economic recovery, increase the pace of innovation, and raise livelihoods for millions of people worldwide.
Financial Inclusion Now
KUALA LUMPUR – Making the financial system accessible to the world’s poorest people can unlock their economic potential, improve their lives, and benefit the wider economy.&nbsp;So it is no surprise that financial inclusion of the poor has become an important component of public policymaking.
Central banks and regulators worldwide are taking the lead in making financial inclusion a priority, in addition to their traditional mandates of maintaining monetary and financial stability.
Financial inclusion is about providing an opportunity for the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked and financially underserved to participate in the formal financial system, thereby helping to lift them out of poverty and enter the economic mainstream.
Greater financial inclusiveness promises a more cohesive society and more balanced growth and development.
Moreover, financial systems themselves stand to benefit from becoming more comprehensive and progressive.
The additional consumers participating in the formal financial system will strengthen national economies and, in turn, enrich the global economy.
Indeed, as developing countries move toward middle-income status, financial inclusion is a key component of continued progress.
In countries with high levels of financial exclusion, consumers are left to rely on unregulated informal services.
These inferior substitutes often imply exorbitant costs for borrowers – and financing that is usually too short term for productive investment activity.
Moreover, the lack of consumer protection and regulatory and supervisory frameworks exposes informal activities to vulnerabilities that can harm borrowers and jeopardize financial stability.
Increasing the availability of formal financial services to those who have long been denied them requires establishing a balanced regulatory framework.
Oppressive, blanket regulation, which may be necessary in complex and unpredictable financial markets, may not be relevant in a rural community –&nbsp;or, worse, it may stifle efforts to promote financial inclusion.
Indeed, proportionality is an important aspect of regulation, enabling prudential measures that, rather than exceed or underestimate, are commensurate with the risks that need to be addressed.
Little wonder, then, that high levels of exclusion in developing and emerging countries have prompted policymakers to embrace proportionate regulation, thereby gaining the flexibility to encourage innovation in the provision of financial services while preserving financial stability.
Bangladesh, for example, has adapted its financial regulations for microfinance institutions.
This has helped to catalyze the growth of sustainable microfinancing to local women-owned enterprises.
Kenya’s “test and learn” approach to regulation has unleashed the potential of mobile-phone-based financial-service delivery through M-PESA, which offers consumers a safe and convenient alternative to cash.
There are many other examples of successful implementation of proportionate regulation that have resulted in greater financial inclusion without compromising financial stability.
In Malaysia, agent-banking regulation (which safeguards consumers’ interests while supporting financial institutions’ business models) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas.
Similarly, Mexico’s “tiered” approach to financial access – according to which requirements for opening bank accounts are proportionate to risk, with low-value accounts subject to higher transaction restrictions – has expanded access to basic accounts, while mitigating the risk of money laundering.
And Pakistan and Indonesia, by basing capital requirements for microfinance institutions on the size of the population that they expect to serve, are enabling these institutions to serve distinct market niches sustainably.
Policymakers in many countries have recently been considering the role of financial standard-setting bodies (SSBs) in advancing financial inclusion.
In particular, they are focusing on the specific challenges that arise when applying supervisory standards in a developing country that is pursuing financial stability and inclusion.
Although global standards supposedly reflect the principles of proportionality, they provide insufficient guidance for the national regulators, banking institutions, and financial-sector assessors who are trying to apply them effectively in diverse environments.
This lack of contextual clarity has led to excessively conservative interpretations of the regulations – and thus to the creation of unintended barriers to financial inclusion.
Addressing this will require input from policymakers with practical experience applying international standards, particularly in emerging economies.
At the same time, in order to ensure continued progress toward financial inclusion, representatives from developing and emerging economies must play a greater role in shaping future standards.
The Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a network of central bankers and financial policymakers from more than 80 developing countries, is already contributing to more effective and proportionate global regulation by facilitating increased engagement with SSBs. This September, Malaysia’s central bank will advance the process by hosting AFI’s Global Policy Forum.
Such collaborative efforts among developing countries ultimately foster closer cooperation between them and their developed counterparts.
This will lead to better outcomes for the global financial system, the global real economy, and, most important, the people who have been excluded from both for far too long.
Occupy QE
NEW HAVEN – The Federal Reserve continues to cling to a destabilizing and ineffective strategy.
By maintaining its policy of quantitative easing (QE) – which entails monthly purchases of long-term assets worth $85 billion – the Fed is courting an increasingly treacherous endgame at home and abroad.
By now, the global repercussions are clear, falling most acutely on developing economies with large current-account deficits – namely, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa.
These countries benefited the most from QE-induced capital inflows, and they were the first to come under pressure when it looked like the spigot was about to be turned off.
When the Fed flinched at its mid-September policy meeting, they enjoyed a sigh-of-relief rally in their currencies and equity markets.
But there is an even more insidious problem brewing on the home front.
With its benchmark lending rate at the zero-bound, the Fed has embraced a fundamentally different approach in attempting to guide the US economy.
It has shifted its focus from the price of credit to influencing the credit cycle’s quantity dimension through the liquidity injections that quantitative easing requires.
In doing so, the Fed is relying on the “wealth effect” – brought about largely by increasing equity and home prices – as its principal transmission mechanism for stabilization policy.
There are serious problems with this approach.
First, wealth effects are statistically small; most studies show that only about 3-5 cents of every dollar of asset appreciation eventually feeds through to higher personal consumption.
As a result, outsize gains in asset markets – and the related risks of new bubbles – are needed to make a meaningful difference for the real economy.
Second, wealth effects are maximized when debt service is minimized – that is, when interest expenses do not swallow the capital gains of asset appreciation.
That provides the rationale for the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy – but at the obvious cost of discriminating against savers, who lose any semblance of interest income.
Third, and most important, wealth effects are for the wealthy.
The Fed should know that better than anyone.
After all, it conducts a comprehensive triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which provides a detailed assessment of the role that wealth and balance sheets play in shaping the behavior of a broad cross-section of American consumers.
In 2010, the last year for which SCF data are available, the top 10% of the US income distribution had median holdings of some $267,500 in their equity portfolios, nearly 16 times the median holdings of $17,000 for the other 90%.
Fully 90.6% of US families in the highest decile of the income distribution owned stocks – double the 45% ownership share of the other 90%.
Moreover, the 2010 SCF shows that the highest decile’s median holdings of all financial assets totaled $550,800, or 20 times the holdings of the other 90%.
At the same time, the top 10% also owned nonfinancial assets (including primary residences) with a median value of $756,400 – nearly six times the value held by the other 90%.
All of this means that the wealthiest 10% of the US income distribution benefit the most from the Fed’s liquidity injections into risky asset markets.
And yet, despite the significant increases in asset values traceable to QE over the past several years – residential property as well as financial assets – there has been little to show for it in terms of a wealth-generated recovery in the US economy.
The problem continues to be the crisis-battered American consumer.
In the 22 quarters since early 2008, real personal-consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70% of US GDP, has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1%, easily the weakest period of consumer demand in the post-World War II era.
That is the main reason why the post-2008 recovery in GDP and employment has been the most anemic on record.
Trapped in the aftermath of a wrenching balance-sheet recession, US families remain fixated on deleveraging – paying down debt and rebuilding their income-based saving balances.
Progress has been slow and limited on both counts.
Notwithstanding sharp reductions in debt service traceable to the Fed’s zero-interest rate subsidy, the stock of debt is still about 116% of disposable personal income, well above the 43% average in the final three decades of the twentieth century.
Similarly, the personal saving rate, at 4.25% in the first half of 2013, is less than half the 9.3% norm over the 1970-1999 period.
This underscores yet another of QE’s inherent contradictions: its transmission effects are narrow, while the problems it is supposed to address are broad.
Wealth effects that benefit a small but extremely affluent slice of the US population have done little to provide meaningful relief for most American families, who remain squeezed by lingering balance-sheet problems, weak labor markets, and anemic income growth.
Nor is there any reason to believe that the benefits at the top will trickle down.
With real consumption stuck on a 1% growth trajectory, the bulk of the US population understandably views economic recovery and job security very differently from those enamored of wealth effects.
The Fed’s goal of pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.5% is a noble one.
But relying on wealth effects targeted at the rich to achieve that goal remains one of the great disconnects in the art and practice of economic policy.
The Occupy Wall Street movement began two years ago this month.
While it can be criticized for its failure to develop a specific agenda for action, it galvanized attention to income and wealth inequality in the US and around the world.
Unfortunately, the problem has only worsened.
Lost in the angst over inequality is the critical role that central banks have played in exacerbating the problem.
Yes, asset markets were initially ecstatic over the Fed’s decision this month not to scale back QE.
The thrill, however, was lost on Main Street.
That is precisely the point.
The Fed’s own survey data, which underscore the concentration of wealth at the upper end of the US income distribution, fit the script of the Occupy movement to a tee.
QE benefits the few who need it the least. That is not exactly a recipe for a broad-based and socially optimal economic recovery.
Russia’s European Game in Syria
PARIS – This much is clear in Syria: There is no good solution.
There has not been a good solution since that black Wednesday in August 2013, when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s war machine, by using chemical weapons, crossed the “red line” that US President Barack Obama had warned would trigger an American military response.
The moderate opposition still stood, and the Islamic State had not yet emerged from the shadows.
Yet, in a shocking last-minute about-face, Obama declined to intervene.
That lapse cannot be undone.
But in the hell of bad solutions on offer for Syria, some are worse than others.
And the one devised by Russian President Vladimir Putin is probably the most infernal of all.
Russian airstrikes have been concentrated on targets around the cities of Idlib, Homs, and Hama – areas where, according to independent observers, jihad watchers, and other groups that scrutinize the videos placed online by the Russian authorities themselves, the Islamic State is not established.
This means that the primary objective of the Russian attacks is to weaken the entire opposition, including the democratic opposition, fighting the Assad regime.
The goal of Russia’s intervention is therefore not to contribute to the “struggle against terrorism,” as the Kremlin’s propagandists claim, but to restore political control, at any cost, to the regime that spawned the terrorism in the first place.
More precisely, Russia’s aim is to rescue (after a long period of arm’s-length support) a dictatorship that American and French authorities describe as being responsible for causing more than 250,000 deaths since 2011.
The regime’s behavior no doubt fueled the terrifying rise of the Islamic State as well, providing Assad with a trump card in his bid for international support – and Russia with a fig leaf.
One might argue that the past is past and that, in view of the general disaster in Syria, Russia’s intervention will at least have the benefit of halting the country’s free fall.
But the first consequence of Putin’s offensive – one employing methods tested in the two Chechen wars and not burdened, to put it mildly, by the precautions observed by Western armed forces – will be to increase, not reduce, the number of civilian casualties.
The world was rightly horrified by America’s recent blunder in bombing the Médecins Sans Frontières’ hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan.
But how many Syrian Kunduzes will result from Russian airstrikes if the Kremlin continues to favor unguided bombs over guided missiles?
(This is just one example of Russia’s tactics, but one that reveals much about how Putin intends to prosecute his latest foreign adventure.)
And can anyone believe, even fleetingly, that Russia’s intervention will lessen, rather than aggravate, Syria’s refugee crisis?
Putin’s methods are forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee indiscriminate airstrikes, clearing the way for the death squads of a regime that in recent months had been showing signs of exhaustion, and dashing any remaining hope of creating effective safe zones in northern Jordan and southern Turkey.
Now even the last holdouts among the regime’s opponents will be appearing on the roads of Europe.
They will not appear on the roads of Russia, mind you: Unlike Germany or France, Putin will not hesitate, while terrorizing tomorrow’s refugees, to slam the door in their faces.
Nor is Putin shy about his intentions in Syria.
One piece of news reported by Russian media but curiously unheeded in the West is that the missile cruiser Moskva, with its dozens of anti-aircraft ordnance, has been deployed to Latakia.
But the Islamic State has not, unbeknownst to everyone but Putin, acquired an air force that needs to be neutralized.
Rather, the Kremlin evidently will view as a legitimate target any aircraft that might pass over territory that it comes to regard as being under its control.
And, because any such plane would necessarily be flying the flag of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Turkey, or another member of the coalition fighting the Islamic State, it is not hard to envisage how Russia’s involvement could lead to international escalation of Syria’s civil war.
Fortunately, we are not there yet.
But let us not pretend that Russia’s military operations, which, to date, have been aimed solely at providing Russia with mastery over Syrian airspace and protecting its interests on the ground, are bolstering efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Putin is not just a fireman who sets fires; he is an old-school imperialist.
His operation in Syria is partly designed to divert attention from his dismemberment of Ukraine.
And his thinly veiled threats against the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, and now Turkey – whose airspace and relations with NATO have been probed by Russian aircraft – reveal a strategy of aggression that has as its chief goal the weakening of Europe.
Europeans must wake up to Putin’s design before it is too late.
In France, the siren song of appeasement is becoming a national rallying cry, from the far-right National Front to far-left elements – and among a growing number of mainstream politicians of all stripes.
Indeed, the Kremlin has assiduously cultivated party secretariats across Europe.
A web of invisible links has brought into being what could be called “Putin’s Party” in Europe.
If Putin’s Party were enticing only the usual European populist demagogues, from Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom to Viktor Órban in Hungary, it would be bad enough.
But when even leaders who are normally considered to be responsible statesmen, such as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, begin justifying Putin’s actions, Europe risks frittering away the very security on which its prosperity is built.
How Scary is Disruptive Technology?
CAMBRIDGE – The steady stream of improvements in driverless cars has convinced me that before too long the roads will be filled with cars and trucks operating without humans at the wheel.
Likewise, I am convinced that the revolution in artificial intelligence will allow computers and robots to do many of the tasks that white-collar workers now do.
It’s not surprising, therefore, that many people are worried about the fate of those whose jobs are vulnerable – or have already been lost – to the latest disruptive technology.
What will happen to the millions of men and women who now drive trucks and taxis when the trucks and taxis can drive themselves?
What will happen to the accountants and health workers when computers can do their jobs?
Some analysts have estimated that, with many fewer employees needed to produce the current volume of goods and services, a large share of current employment could be made redundant.
I hear these worries and realize that they cannot be easily dismissed.
But I am optimistic that the United States, at least, will adapt successfully to the new technology.
There may be some losers as well as winners, but the American public as a whole will be better off.
And those who lose their jobs to the new technology will soon find other employment.
I believe that there is little reason to worry that the new technology will create large-scale unemployment.
The changes in technology will increase the economy’s output and raise the potential standard of living of the population.
Those who want to work will continue to find jobs.
Why am I so optimistic?
Simply put: history.
Rapid technical change is not something new.
We have experienced technological change that substitutes machines and computers for individual workers for many years.
And yet, despite the ups and downs of the business cycle, the US economy continues to return to full employment.
This has been most dramatic in manufacturing.
Robots and automated machines have replaced production workers in manufacturing for many years, driving employment in the sector from 13 million in 1950 to only nine million now, even as the real value of manufacturing output rose by 75%.
And those who are no longer employed in manufacturing have found jobs elsewhere in the economy.
Computers have also replaced workers in a wide range of service industries.
We no longer see many elevator operators.
Switchboard operators are gone.
Most of us get our boarding passes at airports from automated check-in machines.
Law firms and accounting firms use computers to do what professional employees used to do.
And yet the US unemployment rate is now just 4.9%, even lower than its average in recent decades.
Among US college graduates – who constitute 40% of the US labor force – the unemployment rate is just 2.7%.
Because college graduates comprise a larger share of the younger age cohorts than of the older population, the overall unemployment rate will be held down as that group ages and its share of the labor force grows.
The rising output per worker made possible by the increased use of robots and computers also will allow employees to work fewer hours and enjoy more leisure.
Employees in the US currently work an average of 1,790 hours a year, 30% more than their German counterparts, who average just 1,371 hours per year.
A reduction in working hours per employee translates into quality-of-life improvements like longer vacations and longer weekends.
Fewer working hours will also provide more opportunities for travel, eating out, and other activities that create jobs for service workers.
The aging of the population will increase the need for service-sector employees in hospitals and nursing homes as well.
These trends will fuel higher demand for workers in the service sector, which now accounts for 81% of employment in the US.
The share of workers in the US service sector increases year after year; it is where those who lose jobs in manufacturing or construction find new ones.
And computers and robots simply cannot replace many of these jobs.
Although they can provide some of the services that older people will increasingly need, for example, they cannot provide the services that involve actually touching clients and patients.
People choosing careers will bear such considerations in mind as they select occupations.
That, too, will hold down the unemployment rate in the future.
The US unemployment rate currently is less than half the rate in the European Union.
There are many reasons for the disparity; but a critical one is the absence in the US of labor laws and union rules that prevent employees and firms from adapting to the new technologies.
If the US maintains a relatively free labor market, employees will adjust positively to the changing technology.
How Slow Will China Go?
SEOUL – China’s economic performance over the last few decades has been outstanding.
Despite possessing very different institutions than those seen in the advanced economies, no doubt a result of its communist system, China managed to achieve 8.7% average annual per capita GDP growth from 1980 to 2015.
The key has been its unique strategy of “crossing the river by feeling the stones,” whereby it has gradually tested, implemented, and adjusted reforms and growth-enhancing policies.
But, while China’s economic development has been exceptional in many ways, its growth performance is not unique.
Both Japan and South Korea also transformed their economies through rapid industrialization and export-oriented policies, backed by strong investment, before experiencing slowdowns.
If China is to manage its current challenges – in particular, sharply decelerating growth – it should look to these countries’ experience for guidance.
All three countries have followed a similar path, but at a different time.
Based on per capita GDP, China is more than 40 years behind Japan and about 20 years behind South Korea.
Specifically, Japan’s annual per capita GDP growth averaged 8.6% in the 1960s, before plummeting to 3-4% in the 1970s and 1980s.
South Korea’s GDP growth dropped from 7-8% in the 1970s and 1980s to 4% in the 2000s.
China’s three-decade-long run of double-digit growth came to an end in 2010, with the annual rate now below 7%.
In each case, the decline in growth came when per capita income reached about $8,000.
The growth trajectory experienced by these three Asian countries can be explained by the “convergence” phenomenon – the tendency of poor countries to grow faster than rich countries, once they address certain structural and policy factors.
The economic logic of this “catch-up” process is straightforward: for countries with lower levels of per capita output, there is a larger gap between current and potential capital stock and technology.
That gap can be closed rapidly through the adoption and imitation of existing technologies, which improve productivity, and through high rates of accumulation of physical capital, owing to higher returns on investment.
And, indeed, Japan, South Korea, and China all maintained high levels of investment throughout the catch-up process, peaking at nearly 40% of GDP in Japan in the 1970s.
South Korea reached similar levels in the 1990s; and China’s investment spending currently stands at more than 45% of GDP.
As countries move closer to their potential per capita output levels, the power of convergence diminishes, forcing its beneficiaries to adjust their growth models accordingly.
Reducing investment, due to its lower returns, is an important component of that adjustment.
Another is increasing technological innovation, to avoid a sharp slowdown in productivity growth.
A third is shifting output from low-value-added agricultural and manufacturing goods to higher-value-added domestic services.
China, like Japan and South Korea before it, is now pursuing this adjustment.
But it faces serious obstacles, beginning with limited institutional and human capabilities – a constraint that could hinder domestic innovation and efficient resource allocation.
China also faces diminishing labor input growth, owing to low fertility rates and rapid population aging.
According to the United Nations, the average growth rate of the working-age population will be -0.1% in 2010-2020, a sharp decline from 1.5% in 2000-2010.
In addition, as employment moves to the services sector, overall productivity growth could fall, as it did in Japan and South Korea.
In China, GDP growth per worker in the services sector was only 1.3% in 1981-2010, compared to 15.1% in the manufacturing sector.
Of course, China should not be working to restore past rates of GDP growth. That would be a waste of time.
As former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Harvard University professor Robert Barro have pointed out, a slowdown was inevitable for China, just as it was for Japan and South Korea.
My work suggests that China’s GDP growth rate will decline to 5-6% in the coming decade, and 3-4% in the long run.
With its catch-up glory days in the past, China should aim for higher incomes through steady growth and lower volatility.
To achieve this, it must focus specifically on crisis prevention and management. That is where Japan and South Korea went wrong.
In the 1980s, Japan allowed asset bubbles to grow.
That may have spurred growth for a while, but when the bubbles burst, the financial system’s huge debts helped push the economy into a bout of deflation and stagnation from which it has still not fully emerged.
Similarly, South Korea was thrown into financial crisis in 1997, when panicked foreign investors fled, hitting the over-leveraged corporate sector hard as the air was sucked out of the under-supervised financial system.
As it stands, China seems to be moving along a similar path.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, Chinese corporate debt has increased rapidly in recent years, from 99% of GDP in 2008 to 166% in 2015, with more than half of the debt owed by poorly performing state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
This does not bode well for the corporate sector or the financial system.
But it is not too late to change course.
To avert a crisis, China’s leaders must act now to address the weaknesses in the corporate and financial sectors and to improve macroeconomic- and financial-policy frameworks.
To keep productivity – and incomes – rising, they must continue to implement structural reforms that support labor-market flexibility and the development of human capital, while privatizing SOEs and liberalizing the financial sector.
Like its neighbors, China will have to confront slower growth, and its social consequences, head-on.
But the country’s future is anything but predetermined.
With the right approach, it can manage a smooth transition from middle- to high-income status – a transition that would not only improve the wellbeing of China’s 1.3 billion citizens, but also reduce risks and uncertainties in the global economy.
A Healthier Global Health Agenda
LONDON – On September 25, world leaders will meet in New York at a special session of the United Nations to chart a path to a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Described as a “generational opportunity,” the potential is indeed great.
But indications so far suggest that optimal health goals could be derailed.
The SDGs will succeed the Millennium Development Goals, which were adopted in 2000 and expire in 2015.
The MDGs have proved instrumental in galvanizing political will and focusing financial resources on a limited set of basic needs in low- and middle-income countries.
The lives of millions of people, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have been improved.
The SDG framework has been the subject of a year of widespread consultation, lobbying, and debate.
Consensus is emerging in a few areas: the new goals should address the unfinished MDGs; they should include not only poverty, but also planetary limits, including climate change; and they should be universal in scope, addressing challenges such as widening inequality in poor and rich countries alike.
A universal health goal also makes a lot of sense.
Some conditions, such as neglected tropical diseases, are unique to developing countries, while others, like AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal mortality, affect poor countries disproportionately.
But, for the most part, a universal set of maladies has emerged over the past decade, accounting for the vast bulk of ill health and preventable death in all regions of the world.
Unfortunately, the proposed health agenda seems to ignore this trend.
The Global Burden of Disease Study, conducted by hundreds of scientists collaborating over many years, provides the best comparable estimates regarding causes of death and disability and their underlying risk factors.
The data are clear about what makes us sick and kills us prematurely.
Non-communicable diseases accounted for two out of every three deaths worldwide in 2010, and projections indicate that by 2030, NCDs will be the most common cause of death in Africa.
These deaths are largely driven by a few risky behaviors: tobacco smoking (second in the global ranking of risk factors), alcohol use (ranked third), obesity and poor nutrition (ranked sixth and seventh, respectively), and physical inactivity (ranked tenth).
In late July, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon published a short report to inform the upcoming General Assembly debate.
While clear about the need to address the existing MDGs, the report only briefly mentions the burden of NCDs.
While it calls for action to “promote healthy behaviors” it does not include any measures to curb smoking, reduce excessive alcohol consumption, or improve diets; instead, the report focuses solely on water, sanitation, and hygiene (all good things, to be sure).
Why do NCDs, the world’s biggest killers, have such a low profile, given the evidence concerning current and future health needs?
A look at the consultative processes that shaped the Secretary-General’s report provides some clues.
Of the 99 papers reviewed for the health consultation, 15 came from organizations promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights, while only five were from NCD-focused groups (six if a paper from a group supported by the alcohol industry is included).
Equally important, much evidence was simply ignored.
A review of the documents presented to the Secretary-General’s High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, chaired by the Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, reveals a broad range of recommendations, rooted in a deep understanding of current and future global health problems.
The experts recognized that the world’s health problems are shifting away from communicable diseases toward NCDs.
They gave a strong recommendation to include “interventions to reduce the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.”
But the High Level Panel nonetheless arrived at a position that The Lancet, a leading medical journal, characterized as embodying a “weak” commitment to addressing NCDs.
Relegating NCDs to a low position on the global health agenda is not new.
An independent committee of experts convened by the World Health Organization found that the tobacco industry used creative, secretive, and effective tactics to divert the WHO’s focus from NCDs for years.
Recent publications reveal that the food industry pursued similar strategies to influence global health policy.
How can we overcome the role that vested interests may be playing in setting a global health agenda that fails to address key drivers of disease?
Perhaps one answer lies in listening more to the communities directly affected by major health conditions.
For example, people living with and affected by HIV organized vibrant social movements that issued demands for change at national and global levels, dismantled legal and social barriers that exacerbated risk, and articulated norms and standards in human-rights terms.
As a result, huge progress has been made in preventing infections and keeping people living with HIV alive.
The UN General Assembly could do well to listen and learn from that experience.
Everyone, including the most marginalized and vulnerable, has a right to good health, which is essential to human dignity and economic development.
But upholding this right requires that policymakers focus on what makes people sick.
An agenda that powerful corporate interests would rather stifle might be a bitter pill for world leaders, but it is one that they should swallow sooner rather than later.
Starved for Science
AMSTERDAM – In the Mekong Delta, farmers obtain 6-7 tons of rice per hectare in dry seasons and 4-5 tons per hectare in wet seasons, using fast-maturing rice varieties that allow up to three consecutive yields annually.
By contrast, West African rice farmers harvest only 1.5 tons per hectare of traditional upland rice annually, while other cereals yield no more than one ton – a figure comparable to yields in medieval Europe.
Such disparities are unnecessary.
Indeed, the proliferation of agricultural technology – from more efficient machinery to higher-yielding or more robust crop varieties – has the potential to narrow the productivity gap considerably, even if differences between climates and producers remain.
For example, a new variety of African upland rice, Nerica, triples annual yields.
Likewise, over the last four decades, improved breeding methods, higher-quality feed, and better veterinary care have more than doubled average milk production worldwide.
Nevertheless, regional discrepancies remain massive: cows in the Netherlands can produce roughly 9,000 liters of milk annually, while Zebu cattle in the tropics produce only about 300 liters.
The need to increase agricultural output becomes more urgent every day.
The global population is set to reach nine billion by 2050, while people in the developing world – where nearly all of the population growth will occur – are seeking more varied diets.
By 2030, demand for animal products will double, with overall food demand rising by 40%.
Science has much to contribute to global food security.
While genetic modification is not essential to feed the world, it does provide significant advantages, enabling scientists to introduce or enhance traits – virus resistance in cassava, for example, or improved digestibility of feed – that cannot be realized with conventional breeding.
To be sure, raising yields is not the same as feeding the world.
If a vast swath of the population cannot afford the food that is produced, the size of the yield is irrelevant.
While nearly one billion people have been lifted out of poverty (defined by the World Bank as an income of less than $1.25 per day, in purchasing-power-parity terms) in the last 20 years, such progress will prove more difficult for the next billion.
Given this, policymakers should redouble their efforts to reduce poverty by supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
They should commit to advancing sound agricultural management, maintaining well-functioning markets, and increasing investment in agriculture.
At the same time, these objectives, while pressing, should not obscure the need to focus on yields – increases in which have accounted for three-quarters of food-production growth in recent decades.
Fortunately, the most significant potential limitations – land, water, and nutrients – seem unlikely to constrain global output excessively in the foreseeable future.
But, while none is in short supply globally, local shortages may occur.
Although crop land per capita will continue to decline, more arable land is available worldwide than previously thought.
The example of the use of the Brazilian cerrado, once considered useless, augurs well for the African savannas.
Underused land reserves also exist elsewhere in South America, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.
A more immediate challenge is ensuring that crops receive sufficient water, which requires building and maintaining efficient irrigation systems to stabilize yields and enable farmers to harvest an additional crop each year.
As it stands, only 4% of arable land in Sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated, compared to 38% in Asia.
While the Middle East will face serious water shortages, Africa, where most population growth is set to occur, contains numerous unexploited water sources.
Fertilizer use has become significantly more efficient in recent years, a trend that will continue.
Reserves of minerals like phosphate will remain plentiful in the next decades, and nitrogen is not limited.
Technology to extract nutrients from waste already exists, reducing dependency on mining.
Moreover, pigs and poultry are ideal food-waste processors, and their effluents can serve again as nutrient and energy sources, turning future food chains into interconnected production cycles.
Perhaps the most pressing constraint on agricultural production is the impending labor shortage, as rural young people, who traditionally comprise the agricultural labor force, flock to cities.
With small farmers unable to provide sufficient surpluses, agricultural production will become increasingly consolidated and mechanized, raising fossil-fuel consumption, which will have to be offset by the introduction of more efficient technologies.
Of course, future food production is subject to significant uncertainty.
Population growth may not slow down as rapidly as expected.
Protectionism threatens open markets and GDP growth.
And price volatility, whether triggered by drought or short-sighted national policies, could deter investments in agriculture and decrease the poor’s purchasing power.
Whether climate change will be a source of yield uncertainty in the coming decades remains unclear as well.
Although precipitation may be affected, higher temperatures would enable agricultural production in colder regions, and CO2 is known to bolster plant growth, even in dry areas.
In addition, while food hygiene, traceability, and labeling are improving, any amount of negligence when it comes to food safety could have far-reaching consequences in the complex and interconnected global food chain.
Rising demand for animal products highlights microbiological risks, with animal-welfare measures sometimes creating new hazards.
For example, open pens for poultry may increase the spread of communicable diseases like avian influenza.
Despite such risks, the outlook for future food security is promising.
Our food is safer and our diets are more diverse than ever before; production methods are becoming increasingly sustainable, clean, and efficient; and we are constantly becoming better at protecting biodiversity.
Yet many in Europe and the United States – which have benefited most from agricultural advances – are mistrustful of this progress, viewing scientific advancement and free trade as a dangerous combination.
To the extent that this perception impedes progress, it is the real threat to global food security.
How Terrorism\u0027s Victims Became Perpetrators
Why is America in trouble?
September 11 was a traumatic event that shook the nation to its core. But it would not have changed the course of history for the worse if President Bush had not responded as he did.
Declaring war on terrorism was understandable, perhaps even appropriate, as a figure of speech. The problem is that President Bush meant it literally.
I believe there is a direct connection between this and the abuse of detainees by US soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison.
What happened at Abu Ghraib was not a case of a few bad apples, but a pattern tolerated and even encouraged by American authorities.
For example, the Judge Advocate General Corps routinely observes military interrogations from behind a two-way mirror; that practice was discontinued in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The International Red Cross and others started complaining about abuses as early as December 2002.
It is easy to see how terrorism can lead to torture.
Last summer, I took an informal poll at a meeting of Wall Street investors to find out whether they would condone the use of torture to prevent a terrorist attack.
The consensus was that they hoped somebody would do it without their knowing about it.
Americans, sadly, are now victims who have turned into perpetrators.
Indeed, since September 2001, the war on terror has claimed more innocent victims than those terrorist attacks.
This fact is unrecognized at home because the victims of the war on terror are not Americans.
But the rest of the world does not draw the same distinction, and world opinion has turned against America.
The Bush administration knew what it was doing when it declared war on terror and used that pretext for invading Iraq.
Perhaps Bush did not personally recognize this, but Vice President Dick Cheney and a group of extremists concentrated in and around the Pentagon did.
These people are guided by the belief that international relations are relations of power, not law.
Because America is the most powerful nation on earth, it ought to use that power more assertively.
They advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein even before Bush was elected and won him to their cause after September 11.
The invasion of Afghanistan could be justified on the grounds that the Taliban provided Bin Laden and Al Qaeda with a secure training ground. Invading Iraq could not be similarly justified.
Nevertheless, the ideologues in the administration were determined to pursue it because, in the words of Paul Wolfowitz, "it was doable."
President Bush managed to convince the nation that Saddam Hussein had some connection with the suicide bombers of September 11, and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction.
When both claims proved false, he argued that America invaded Iraq to liberate the Iraqi people.
That claim was even more far-fetched.
If America had really cared for the Iraqi people, more troops would have been sent to provide protection not only for the Ministry of Oil, but for museums and hospitals, too.
Instead, Iraq was devastated by looting.
Now that America's position has become unsustainable, the Bush administration is handing over power to local militias in Falluja and elsewhere.
This prepares the ground for religious and ethnic divisions and possible civil war à la Bosnia, rather than democracy.
I would love to pin the blame for all this on Bush and his team. But that would ignore that Bush was playing to a receptive audience.
Indeed, after all that has happened, a majority of the US electorate continues to have confidence in Bush on national security matters.
If this continues and Bush is reelected, Americans must ask the question: "What is wrong with us?"
America needs profound soul-searching.
The terrorists seem to have hit upon a weak point in America's collective psyche. They have made Americans fearful and found a willing co-conspirator in the Bush administration.
For reasons of its own, the Bush administration has found it advantageous to nurture the fear that September 11 engendered.
By declaring war on terror, Bush united the country behind him.
But fear is a bad counselor.
By succumbing to fear Americans are doing the terrorists' bidding: unleashing a vicious cycle of violence that may result in a permanent state of war.
The war on terror need never end; because the terrorists are invisible, they will never disappear.
The war on terror polarizes the world.
In battles for survival, whether in Yugoslavia or Israel, everyone sticks with his own tribe or nation, whether its policies are right or wrong.
This is the state of mind that Bush sought to foster when he declared that those who are not "with us" are with the terrorists.
That attitude cannot be reconciled with an open society, a concept based on the recognition that nobody possesses ultimate truth.
Might is not necessarily right. It is not enough to reject the Bush administration's policies; Americans must reaffirm the values and principles of an open society.
The war on terror is an aberration. America must defend itself against terrorist attacks, but that cannot be allowed to become the overarching objective of its existence.
Today, no single country or combination of countries can stand up to American military might.
The main threat to America's dominant position comes not from outside, but from within.
If Americans fail to recognize that they may be wrong, they risk undermining the country's dominant position.
Being the most powerful nation gives America privileges, but it also imposes obligations.
If Americans want to preserve their privileged position, they must not use it to dictate to the rest of the world, but for the well being of others.
Indeed, many problems-maintaining peace, ensuring law and order, protecting the environment, reducing poverty, and fighting terrorism-require collective action.
Americans cannot do anything they want, but little can be done without US leadership or active participation.
Instead of undermining and demeaning international institutions because they do not necessarily follow America's will, the US should strengthen and improve them.
Instead of engaging in preemptive military actions, the US should pursue preventive actions of a constructive nature, creating a better balance between carrots and sticks in the prevailing world order.
Emerging Markets’ Euro Nemesis
BRUSSELS – Emerging markets’ currencies are crashing, and their central banks are busy tightening policy, trying to stabilize their countries’ financial markets.
Who is to blame for this state of affairs?
A few years ago, when the US Federal Reserve embarked on yet another round of “quantitative easing,” some emerging-market leaders complained loudly.
They viewed the Fed’s open-ended purchases of long-term securities as an attempt to engineer a competitive devaluation of the dollar and worried that ultra-easy monetary conditions in the United States would unleash a flood of “hot money” inflows, driving up their exchange rates.
This, they feared, would not only diminish their export competitiveness and push their external accounts into deficit; it would also expose them to the harsh consequences of a sudden stop in capital inflows when US policymakers reversed course.
At first sight, these fears appear to have been well founded.
As the title of a recent paper published by the International Monetary Fund succinctly puts it, “Capital Flows are Fickle: Anytime, Anywhere.”
The mere announcement that the Fed might scale down its unconventional monetary-policy operations has led to today’s capital flight from emerging markets.
But this view misses the real reason why capital flowed into emerging markets over the last few years, and why the external accounts of so many of them have swung into deficit.
The real culprit is the euro.
Quantitative easing in the US cannot have been behind these large swings in global current-account balances, because America’s external deficit has not changed significantly in recent years.
This is also what one would expect from economic theory: in conditions approaching a liquidity trap, the impact of unconventional monetary policies on financial conditions and demand is likely to be modest.
Indeed, the available models tell us that, to the extent that an expansionary monetary policy actually does have an impact on the economy, its effect on the current account should not be large, because any positive effect on exports from a weaker exchange rate should be offset by larger imports due to the increase in domestic demand.
This is what has happened in the US, and its recent economic revival has been accompanied by an expansion of both exports and imports.
The impact of the various rounds of quantitative easing on emerging markets (and on the rest of the world) has thus been approximately neutral.
But austerity in Europe has had a profound impact on the eurozone’s current account, which has swung from a deficit of almost $100 billion in 2008 to a surplus of almost $300 billion this year.
This was a consequence of the sudden stop of capital flows to the eurozone’s southern members, which forced these countries to turn their current accounts from a combined deficit of $300 billion five years ago to a small surplus today.
Because the external-surplus countries of the eurozone’s north, Germany and Netherlands, did not expand their demand, the eurozone overall is now running the world’s largest current-account surplus – exceeding even that of China, which has long been accused of engaging in competitive currency manipulation.
This extraordinary swing of almost $400 billion in the eurozone’s current-account balance did not result from a “competitive devaluation”; the euro has remained strong.
So the real reason for the eurozone’s large external surplus today is that internal demand has been so weak that imports have been practically stagnant over the last five years (the average annual growth rate was a paltry 0.25%).
The cause of this state of affairs, in one word, is austerity.
Weak demand in Europe is the real reason why emerging markets’ current accounts deteriorated (and, with the exception of China, swung into deficit).
Thus, if anything, emerging-market leaders should have complained about European austerity, not about US quantitative easing.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s talk of “tapering” quantitative easing might have triggered the current bout of instability; but emerging markets’ underlying vulnerability was made in Europe.
The fickleness of capital markets poses once again the paradox of thrift.
As capital withdraws from emerging markets, these countries soon will be forced to adopt their own austerity measures and run current-account surpluses, much like the eurozone periphery today.
But who will then be able – and willing – to run deficits?
Two of the world’s three largest economies come to mind: China, given the strength of its balance sheet, and the eurozone, given the euro’s status as a reserve currency.
But both appear committed to running large surpluses (indeed, the two largest in the world).
This implies that, unless the US resumes its role as consumer of last resort, the latest bout of financial-market jitters will weaken the global economy again.
And any global recovery promises to be unbalanced – that is, if it materializes at all.
A Time for Action in the Middle East
LONDON – The announcement, following the use of chemical weapons in Syria, of an emergency summit in Jordan this week of military leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar is a welcome development.
Western policy is at a crossroads: commentary or action; shaping events or reacting to them.
After the long and painful campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, I understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil, to watch but not to intervene, to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard, even harsh business of changing reality on the ground.
But we have to understand the consequences of wringing our hands instead of putting them to work.
People wince at the thought of intervention.
But contemplate the future consequences of inaction and shudder: Syria, mired in the carnage between the brutality of Bashar al-Assad and various affiliates of Al Qaeda, a breeding ground of extremism infinitely more dangerous than Afghanistan in the 1990’s; Egypt in chaos, with the West, however unfairly, looking as if it is giving succor to those who would turn it into a Sunni version of Iran; and Iran itself, despite its new president, still a theocratic dictatorship, with a nuclear bomb.
The West would appear confused, its allies would be dismayed, and its enemies would be emboldened.
This is a nightmare scenario, but it is not far-fetched.
Start with Egypt.
To many in the West, it is clear that the Egyptian military has removed a democratically elected government and is now repressing a legitimate political party, killing its supporters and imprisoning its leaders.
So we are on a steady track toward ostracizing the new government.
In doing so, we think that we are upholding our values.
I completely understand this view.
But to embrace it would be a grave strategic error.
The fallacy of this approach lies in the Muslim Brotherhood’s nature.
We think of it as a normal political party.
It is not. If you want to join the UK Conservative Party or the German Christian Democrats or America’s Democratic Party, you can do so easily, and they will welcome you with open arms.
In all of these countries, all parties respect basic democratic freedoms.
The Muslim Brotherhood is not such a party.
Becoming a member is a seven-year process of induction and indoctrination.
The Brotherhood is a movement run by a hierarchy that is more akin to the Bolsheviks.
Read their speeches – those put out not for Western ears, but for their own.
What they were doing in Egypt was not “governing badly.”
If you elect a bad government, then tough – you live with it.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, was systematically changing the constitution and taking control of the commanding heights of the state in order to make it impossible for its rule to be challenged.
And it was doing so in pursuit of values that contradict everything for which democracy stands.
So you can rightly criticize the actions or overreactions of Egypt’s new military government; but it is difficult to criticize the intervention that brought it into being.
Now all of the choices that Egypt faces are ugly.
There are large numbers of soldiers and police among the casualties, as well as civilians; and, partly as a byproduct of the fall of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, Egypt is awash with weapons.
But simply condemning the military will not bring a return to democracy any nearer.
Egypt is not a creation of nineteenth- or twentieth-century global power games.
It is an ancient civilization stretching back thousands of years, imbued with fierce national pride.
The army has a special place in its society.
The people do want democracy, but they will be disdainful of Western critics whom they will see as utterly naive in the face of the threat to democracy that the Muslim Brotherhood posed.
We should support the new government in stabilizing the country; urge everyone, including the Muslim Brotherhood, to get off the streets; and let a proper and short process to an election with independent observers be put in place.
A new constitution that protects minority rights and the basic ethos of the country should be drafted, and all political parties should operate according to rules that ensure transparency and commitment to the democratic process.
This is the only realistic way to help those – probably a majority – who want genuine democracy, not an election used as a route to domination.
In Syria, we know what is happening – and that it is wrong to let it happen.
But leave aside any moral argument and just think of the world’s interests for a moment.
Doing nothing would mean Syria’s disintegration, divided in blood, with the countries around it destabilized and waves of terrorism rolling over the region.
Assad would remain in power in the richest part of the country, with bitter sectarian fury reigning in the country’s eastern hinterland.
Iran, with Russia’s support, would be ascendant – and the West apparently impotent.
I hear people talk as if nothing can be done: the Syrian defense systems are too powerful, the issues too complex, and in any event, why take sides when one is as bad as the next?
But others are taking sides.
They are not terrified of the prospect of intervention.
They are intervening in support of a regime that is assaulting civilians in ways not seen since the dark days of Saddam Hussein.
It is time we took a side: the side of the people who want what we want; who see our societies, for all their faults, as something to admire; who know that they should not be faced with a choice between tyranny and theocracy.
I detest the implicit notion behind so much of our commentary that the Arabs or, even worse, the people of Islam, are unable to understand what a free society looks like, that they cannot be trusted with something so modern as a polity where religion is in its proper place.
It is not true.
What is true is that there is a life-and-death struggle going on over the future of Islam, with extremists aiming to subvert both its open-minded tradition and the modern world.
In this struggle, we should not be neutral.
Wherever this extremism is destroying the lives of innocent people – from Iran to Syria, Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, as well as elsewhere in Africa, Central Asia, and the Far East – we should be at their side.
As one of the architects of policy after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, I know the controversy, anguish, and cost of the decisions taken.
I understand why the pendulum has swung so heavily the other way.
But it is not necessary to revert to that policy to make a difference.
And the forces that made intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq so difficult are of course the very forces at the heart of the storm today.
They have to be defeated.
We should defeat them, however long it takes, because otherwise they will not disappear.
They will grow stronger, until we will reach another crossroads; at that point, there will be no choice.
How the West Was Re-Won
PARIS – In 2005, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, a prestigious exhibit sponsored by the Chinese Government, “The Three Emperors,” celebrated the greatness of Chinese art.
The show’s central piece was a giant painting in the European (Jesuit) style depicting the envoys of the Western world lining up to pay respect to the Chinese emperor.
The message could not have been more explicit: “China is back.”
The West would have to pay tribute to China in the future the way it had kowtowed to it in the past.
In 2012, China is on the verge of becoming the world’s largest economy and is by far the leading emerging power.
Yet two simultaneous phenomena suggest that the West may have been buried prematurely by its own Cassandras and by Asian pundits who sometimes behave like “arrogant Westerners.”
First, the West, particularly Europe, is slowly taking the measure of the Asian challenge.
Second, it is doing so at the very moment that the emerging countries are starting to feel the consequences of a world economic crisis that has Europe as its epicenter.
In other words, a new balance of strengths and weaknesses is emerging beneath the surface of events – and runs contrary to current mantras.
Europe has awakened to the Asian challenge just as its own crisis exposes and intensifies the emerging countries’ economic, political, and social weaknesses.
A few years ago, in my book The Geopolitics of Emotion, I stressed the differences that existed between a Western world dominated by fear and an Asia animated by hope.
While the West accumulated debts, Asia had startled the world with its long economic boom.
This continues to be the case, but nuances are appearing.
There is more fear today in the West, but also a little less hope in Asia.
Indeed, global investors are starting to hedge their bets, as if preparing themselves for a more genuinely balanced world spanning different continents and cultures.
Asia may have caught up with the West; Latin America may be on track to do so; and Africa may be slowly positioning itself to grow.
The Arab world, too, with its ongoing revolution, may also be joining the game, overcoming the humiliation that had been its peoples’ animating emotional force.
The West, meanwhile, may be slowly adapting to the new realities of a world that it no longer dominates, but in which it still occupies an essential role, owing to values whose universalism is now formulated in a more restrained and coherent way.
Indeed, to fear, hope, and humiliation, I would now add a fourth and decisive cultural mood: modesty.
Today’s West is very different from the historical West.
It is a reduced entity, increasingly aware that it can no longer be the center of the world, if only because of its shrinking demographic weight.
Europe accounted for 20% of the world’s population at the beginning of the eighteenth century; the population of the West as a whole will constitute slightly more than 10% in 2050.
The West is also fragmented: the American West is growing increasingly apart from the European West.
The question is no longer one of shared interests or common security goals, but of culture, as the United States, in particular, increasingly looks to Asia and Latin America and attracts immigrants from those regions.
As for the Asian West, Japan will continue to remain alone and unique.
Given this, it might seem premature, to say the least, to announce the “return of the West,” especially at a time when the US economy remains fragile, Europe’s financial crisis is fueling an existential funk, and Japan’s deep structural malaise continues.
Still, across Europe, particularly in the south, one is witnessing a willingness to learn from others.
There is a growing awareness, even in France – not known for its humility – that benchmarking is necessary, and that tough sacrifices will have to be made.
In other words, Europeans are beginning to understand that they have lived well beyond their means materially, and well below their means intellectually, spiritually, and ethically – a process that might be described as the beginning of Europe’s “Montization,” to pay tribute to Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s embodiment of responsibility and courage.
Just imagine: a more virtuous Europe encountering a more “decadent” China, whose venal elites are starting to turn on each other?
What we may be witnessing is the consolidation of a truly multipolar world, in which the West no longer dominates, but is not about to be replaced by Asia or the emerging world in general.
The West is not “striking back.”
But a more modest West may stabilize its position with respect to China, particularly at a time when China has become both more arrogant and less confident in its own political and social system.
America’s Rehearsals for Retirement
BERKELEY – As the first wave of America’s baby boomers begins to retire, the retirement system is revealing its flaws.
More than half of all workers (and more than 60% of low-income workers) are at risk of lacking sufficient savings to maintain their living standards after they stop working.
In a recent international comparison, America’s retirement system received a passing grade of C; but, for a large and growing number of Americans, the system is failing.
The slow recovery from the Great Recession has exacerbated the challenge.
Homes are most Americans’ major retirement asset, and, despite a recent pickup, housing prices are still 28% below their 2006 peak, while 28% of all homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their property is worth.
Discretionary employer retirement plans are a major pillar of America’s retirement system.
But nearly 16 million Americans are either unemployed or have dropped out of the labor force, while more than half of the jobs created during the recovery are low-wage positions that usually do not offer such plans.
By contrast, most of the 625,000 public-sector jobs lost during the recovery offered generous pensions.
Nearly 60% of all employed private-sector workers aged 25-64 are not covered by employer retirement plans, and coverage rates vary by income: 73% of all workers in the top earnings quartile are covered by such plans, compared to only 38% in the bottom quartile.
Plan participation also varies by income, with low-income workers much less likely to participate than high-income workers.
The lack of universal coverage also means that workers move in and out of plans as they change jobs; more than one-third of all households end up with no employer-based pension coverage.
By contrast, in several other countries, mandatory employer and employee participation in national employer-based plans means nearly universal coverage.
Personal retirement savings, another pillar of the US retirement system, are woefully inadequate for most households, partly because the decades-long stagnation in median wages has made it difficult to save.
According to a recent study, one-third of Americans aged 45-54 have nothing saved specifically for retirement.
Meanwhile, three-quarters of near-retirees – those aged 50-64 – have annual incomes below $52,201 and average total retirement savings of less than $27,000.
The United States relies on generous tax incentives to encourage personal retirement savings, but these incentives are poorly targeted and yield limited returns.
More than 80% of the value of these incentives goes to the top 20% of taxpayers, who earn more than $100,000 a year.
Moreover, while the incentives cost the US Treasury nearly $100 billion annually, they induce little new saving; instead, they cause high-income taxpayers to shift their savings to tax-advantaged assets – a major reason why President Barack Obama proposes capping the tax deduction for retirement saving.
A more radical proposal would convert the tax deduction into a means-tested and refundable matching government contribution – deposited directly into a taxpayer’s individual retirement account (IRA).
Taxpayers are more responsive to matching incentives than they are to tax incentives, because the former are easier to understand and more transparent.
Lack of coverage in employer-based plans and insufficient personal savings leave more than one-third of all households (and more than 75% of low-income households) entirely dependent on Social Security for their retirement income.
And, because Social Security replaces only about 40% of pre-retirement income for low-wage workers and less than a third for median-wage workers, those who rely on it as their sole source of income live at or below the poverty line.
(Replacement rates in other developed countries are in the 70% range, compared to a benchmark of 80% recommended by retirement experts.)
Addressing the looming retirement crisis in the US requires increasing worker coverage in employer-based plans.
Here, automatic enrollment, unless workers opt out, has proved effective, boosting employee participation to more than 90%.
Indeed, recent research indicates that automatic enrollment is much more effective than tax incentives for increasing retirement saving.
But many employers do not offer retirement plans, while almost all workers are eligible for tax-advantaged IRAs.
As Obama has proposed, employers that do not offer retirement plans should be required to offer automatic contributions to their workers’ IRAs through regular payroll deductions.
Matching government contributions should be used in lieu of, or in addition to, tax deductions to encourage low-income workers to participate.
California and several other US states are also evaluating new state-administered retirement-savings programs for private-sector workers without access to employer-based plans.
The California plan, based on a proposal by Teresa Ghilarducci and her colleagues, would automatically enroll eligible employees, defined as private-sector workers at firms with five or more employees that do not offer retirement plans.
Contributions would be made through automatic payroll deductions by employers at a default rate of 3% of gross pay, but employees could opt out or adjust their contribution rates.
Under this scheme, each worker would have an individual account balance (treated as an IRA from a tax perspective), but the assets that secure the plan’s benefits would be held in a pooled trust, with a real return guaranteed by private insurance and paid out as an annuity upon retirement.
Accounts would be linked to workers, not to their employers, ensuring portability between jobs.
(The lack of portability and the absence of annuity payouts are major shortcomings of most employer plans.)
An independent board would oversee the state plan’s administration, relying on a competitive bidding process to select investment managers.
Senator Tom Harkin recently proposed a national plan with many similar features, open to all workers whose employer plans do not meet minimum requirements.
The countries that outrank the US on the global retirement index in terms of coverage, adequacy of benefits, and long-term sustainability have national pension plans in addition to their basic social-security-type programs.
Some are mandatory, some have automatic enrollment, and some rely on matching government contributions to encourage participation.
In the US, making saving easier and more financially rewarding through better-targeted tax incentives, matching government contributions, automatic IRAs, and state-wide retirement plans would help boost retirement savings, especially for low- and middle-income households.
Improving financial literacy would also help.
The current obsession with government deficits and budgetary constraints should not deflect attention from the need for reforms that address the looming retirement crisis confronting many Americans.
How to Default on Sovereign Debt
ITHACA – The financial brinkmanship over Greece’s debts has raised the question of whether (or when) the country will default.
To be sure, it would be far better for Greece and its creditors to reach a negotiated solution.
But that outcome is far from guaranteed.
The Greek government barely managed to make a significant payment last month, and even larger payments fall due throughout the summer, starting in June with an installment of more than €1.5 billion on its liabilities to the International Monetary Fund.
As Greek officials consider their options, they would do well to bear in mind that there are better and worse ways to default on sovereign debt – especially given countries’ desire to reestablish their creditworthiness as soon as possible.
In the coming weeks and months, the Greek government would be wise to consider three guidelines:
Don’t name-call: Default is painful, even if it does turn out to be the right choice in the long run.
In the midst of all that pain, it is tempting to point fingers.
But it is important to resist this urge.
More likely than not, sovereign debtors will have to interact with the same creditors and international actors again.
It is hard to know how much harm Argentina’s undiplomatic pronouncements during its default saga did to its efforts at navigating the United States’ legal system; what is clear is that its ill-considered official rhetoric did not help its case.
In the Greek context, there has already been enough name-calling for several debt crises.
Issuing a statement of regret at the inability to reach a negotiated solution, offering clear short- and long-term plans to manage the default, and outlining a compelling strategy for recovery and growth would be far preferable.
Explain yourself: In the aftermath of a default, it may seem that no one is listening to even the most rational of explanations.
Creditors will likely insist that the default was a terrible mistake and argue that recovery is impossible unless the decision is quickly reversed.
Some commentators may actually wish an insubordinate country ill, if only to prove a point or teach would-be followers a lesson.
But other actors, including potential future creditors, could be more open to persuasion.
Creditworthiness is generally understood to depend on two things: willingness to pay and ability to pay.
A default is a concrete demonstration of the limits of a state’s willingness to pay, at least in the short term.
And yet things are not necessarily so black and white.
A country that is defaulting can emphasize that the rejection of a particular debt payment does not necessarily entail a rejection of the logic of debt payments as a whole.
In the case of Greece, some investors and commentators may sympathize with the authorities’ contention that austerity measures have only hampered its recovery.
They may accept that a default could be part of a policy package designed to improve the country’s economic fundamentals and thus its capacity to repay its debt in the long term.
Repay some debt: It sounds counterintuitive, but countries in default should consider paying some of their debts – on their own terms and on a graduated basis – as a way to rebuild creditworthiness.
If the explanation for a default includes an assertion that payments should be tied to economic recovery, then it can make sense to specify the conditions for resuming payments – and follow through when the conditions are met.
To be sure, this could weaken a debtor’s leverage – the promise of future repayment – in bringing creditors back to the negotiating table.
But it would also demonstrate to old and potential new creditors alike not only a capacity, but also a willingness, to make payments, thereby creating incentives for external actors to support economic recovery.
Even after the Soviet Union’s repudiation of czarist Russia’s debts – perhaps the twentieth century’s most notorious (and most misunderstood) debt default – certain creditors expressed interest in lending to the new regime, in part because Soviet agencies repaid debt that they considered legitimate.
More recently, Ecuador continued payments on the small portion of debt that it considered acceptable after defaulting on its international debts in 2008 (under circumstances far less extreme than Greece’s).
This repayment contributed to a slow improvement in its credit rating and its eventual return to international capital markets in 2014.
Even if Greece reaches an agreement in time to make the first IMF installment due in early June, it may not have enough to cover the even larger payments required of it through the rest of the summer.
Chances are that the Greek government and its creditors will be back at the negotiating table again.
A unilateral default, one hopes, will not be necessary.
But if Greece does take that route, it should seek to make its path as smooth as possible.
How to Emerge from the Crisis in 2009
WASHINGTON, DC – In the maelstrom of events and news that characterize the current global crisis, it is often difficult to keep a clear head and a sense of what is really going on.
But when one takes a step back (something easier to do on days when markets are closed), the picture becomes clearer, and so do the required policies.
Let me first set the scene by making three observations on where we are today.
First, in the advanced countries, we have probably seen the worst of the financial crisis.
There are still land mines, from unknowable credit default swap (CDS) positions to hidden losses on balance sheets, but the worst days of frozen money markets and obscene risk spreads are probably over.&nbsp;
Second, and unfortunately, the financial crisis has moved to emerging countries.
In crossing borders, the sharp portfolio reallocations and the rush to safer assets are creating not only financial but also exchange-rate crises.
Add to this the drop in output in advanced countries, and you can see how emerging countries now suffer from both higher credit costs and decreased export demand.
Third, in the advanced economies, the hit to wealth, and even more so the specter of another Great Depression, has led people and firms to curtail spending sharply.
Not only have they revised their spending plans, but, in many cases, they have delayed purchases, waiting for the uncertainty to clear.
The result has been a sharp drop in output and employment, reinforcing fears about the future, and further decreasing spending.&nbsp;
Let me now turn to policy.
If my characterization of events is correct, then the right set of policies is straightforward:
First, the measures put in place earlier to repair the financial system must be refined and consolidated.
One silver lining of the worst days of the crisis in October was to scare governments into action on the financial front.
Central banks generously provided liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But governments soon realized that the main issue was solvency.
They pledged to implement programs aimed at asset purchases (to clarify the balance sheets of financial institutions), recapitalization (to make sure that, if solvent, they could operate and continue to lend), and guarantees (to reassure depositors and some investors that their funds were safe).
The basic architecture for these measures is now in place, but the implementation has been often haphazard.
Lessons from previous banking crises around the world could have been learned faster.
The twists and turns in some of the programs, most notably in the United States, have left markets confused, and have led private investors to stay on the sidelines, waiting for policy clarification before taking a stake in financial institutions.
I have little doubt that learning by doing will eventually lead to coherent programs.
But time has been lost.&nbsp;
Second, emerging market countries must get help in adjusting to the financial crisis.
It is not just a question of providing them with liquidity so that they can simply maintain their exchange rates in the face of a large capital outflows.
Many investors who want out will not return for some time, and countries must accept this fact and adjust accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In some cases, they can do this on their own, so all that is needed is liquidity support to avoid a collapse of the exchange rate and allow for the adjustment to occur.
In other cases, the capital outflows only worsen already difficult situations.
These countries need more than liquidity; they need financial help to carry out the necessary adjustments.
Are the proper help measures in place?
Yes and no.
For a few countries, the main central banks have provided access to liquidity through swap lines.
The International Monetary Fund, for its part, has created a new liquidity facility, enabling countries that pre-qualify to apply and get funds with little or no conditionality.
For the time being, these arrangements have been sufficient.
But liquidity provision needs to be provided on a more coherent and comprehensive basis.
As for countries that need more help, this is the IMF’s natural function. A number of countries have already obtained funds under program lending.
One may reasonably worry that the available funds will be depleted before the crisis is over.
Third, governments must counteract the sharp drop in consumption and investment demand.
In the absence of strong policies, it is too easy to think of scary scenarios in which depressed output and troubles in the financial system feed on each other, leading to further large drops in output.
It is thus essential for governments to make clear that they will do everything to eliminate this downside risk.
Can they credibly do it?
The answer is yes.
With interest rates already low, the room for monetary policy is limited.
But the room for fiscal policy is wider, so governments must do two things urgently.
First, in countries in which there is fiscal space, they must announce credible fiscal expansions; we – the IMF – believe that, as a whole, a global fiscal expansion about 2% of world GDP is both feasible and appropriate.
Finally, and just as importantly, governments must indicate that, if conditions deteriorate, further fiscal expansion will be implemented.
Only with such a commitment will people and firms be confident that we are not headed for a repeat of the Great Depression, and start spending again.&nbsp;
My strong belief is that if these policies are followed, by the end of 2009, if not sooner, the world economy will start recovering from the crisis.
In the lower-middle-income countries, social protection reaches about a quarter of those living in extreme poverty, leaving about a half-billion people without coverage.
How to End the Greek Tragedy
SANTIAGO – European leaders, faced with the reality of an insolvent Greece, are reportedly now considering a “Plan B” that would involve reducing the burden of its future debt payments.
This is a welcome contrast to the options considered so far, all of which involved – under different guises – foisting more debt onto a country that has too much of it already.
Greek public debt today stands at nearly 160% of the country’s official GDP. Suppose Greece took 25 years to bring it down to the Maastricht ceiling of 60%.
If the real interest rate on Greek debt were 4% (more or less what Greece is paying now for the emergency loans from the European Union) and annual GDP grew by 2% on average, the required primary fiscal surplus each year for the next quarter-century would be 5.7% of GDP.
That is an unimaginably large burden, and it risks condemning Greece to permanent recession and social unrest.
A possible counterargument is that Greece has a large informal economy, so its actual GDP is larger than the official figure. As a result, the debt ratios commonly applied to Greece could be overstated.
But informal output is of little use for debt service if it cannot be taxed.
In any case, the scope for tax increases is severely limited in an economy that is shrinking quickly.
The conclusion is clear: Greece’s debt-service burden is too large, and it must be reduced.
This can be accomplished in two ways: sharply cutting the interest rate paid by Greece, or reducing the face value of the debt.
Some analysts – most prominently Jeffrey Sachs – have argued that the best way forward is to cut the yield on Greek debt to that of German public debt. Germany currently pays a little over 3% nominal interest on 10-year debt, half of what Greece is being charged for emergency loans – and far less than Greece would pay if it attempted to raise money in private markets.
This approach has several advantages: by leaving the face value of the debt unaltered, EU officials could argue that restructuring Greece’s debt did not amount to a default, thereby limiting contagion.
European banks holding Greek government debt could keep pretending that it is worth its full value.
And the European Central Bank would have fewer excuses to refuse Greek bonds as collateral.
The question is whether the change in coupons – possibly coupled with an extension of maturities – would be enough to stabilize the Greek economy and restore growth.
Even with German-level interest rates, Greece would have to run a primary surplus of at least 2% of GDP – still quite large, and far from today’s deficit.
And, with the face value of the debt unchanged, the psychological drag on expectations and investment might linger.
The alternative is to cut the face value of Greece’s debt.
European leaders seem to be moving in this direction.
The required cut is large: eliminating half of Greece’s public debt obligation would leave it at nearly 80% of GDP, a ratio higher than Spain’s.
Talk of “haircuts” for private investors immediately triggers concerns about contagion.
But markets are already assigning a high probability to a Greek default.
The rating agencies have long placed Greek debt deep in junk territory, and are now giving Portuguese and Irish debt the same status.
Rising spreads in Spain and Italy show that contagion is already occurring, even in the absence of an official decision to write down Greek debt.
The EU is pinning its hopes on one mechanism to reduce Greek debt: loans from the European Financial Stability Facility that would allow Greece to buy its own debt at a discount in the secondary market.
But, while allowing the EFSF to finance buybacks is a step forward, a slew of theoretical and empirical research, generated by developing countries’ efforts to buy back their debt in the 1980’s and 1990’s, has shown that it is far from a cure-all.
The main reason is simple: as debt is reduced, its price rises in the secondary market, sharply curtailing the benefits to the borrower.
So far, policymakers are talking only about exchanging old Greek bonds for cash (in buybacks) or new Greek bonds.
It would be far preferable to exchange them for Eurobonds, backed by the full faith and credit of all eurozone countries.
Nor are European ministers, still struggling to catch up with reality, yet considering involuntary debt exchanges.
But, if the past 18 months are any guide, they soon will be.
How to Fail to Recover
NEW YORK – Some people thought that Barack Obama’s election would turn everything around for America.
Because it has not, even after the passage of a huge stimulus bill, the presentation of a new program to deal with the underlying housing problem, and several plans to stabilize the financial system, some are even beginning to blame Obama and his team.
Obama, however, inherited an economy in freefall, and could not possibly have turned things around in the short time since his inauguration.
President Bush seemed like a deer caught in the headlights –�paralyzed, unable to do almost anything – for months before he left office.
It is a relief that the US finally has a president who can act, and what he has been doing will make a big difference.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, what he is doing is not enough.
The stimulus package appears big – more than 2% of GDP per year – but one-third of it goes to tax cuts.
And, with Americans facing a debt overhang, rapidly increasing unemployment (and the worst unemployment compensation system among major industrial countries), and falling asset prices, they are likely to save much of the tax cut.
Almost half of the stimulus simply offsets the contractionary effect of cutbacks at the state level.
America’s 50 states must maintain balanced budgets.
The total shortfalls were estimated at $150 billion a few months ago; now the number must be much larger – indeed, California alone faces a shortfall of $40 billion.
Household savings are finally beginning to rise, which is good for the long-run health of household finances, but disastrous for economic growth. Meanwhile, investment and exports are plummeting as well.
America’s automatic stabilizers –�the progressivity of our tax systems, the strength of our welfare system – have been greatly weakened, but they will provide some stimulus, as the expected fiscal deficit soars to 10% of GDP.
In short, the stimulus will strengthen America’s economy, but it is probably not enough to restore robust growth. This is bad news for the rest of the world, too, for a strong global recovery requires a strong American economy.
The real failings in the Obama recovery program, however, lie not in the stimulus package but in its efforts to revive financial markets.
America’s failures provide important lessons to countries around the world, which are or will be facing increasing problems with their banks:
- Delaying bank restructuring is costly, in terms of both the eventual bailout costs and the damage to the overall economy in the interim.
- Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem, so they give the banking system just enough to survive, but not enough to return it to health.
- Confidence is important, but it must rest on sound fundamentals.
Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made, and that the business acumen of financial-market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored.
- Bankers can be expected to act in their self-interest on the basis of incentives.
Perverse incentives fueled excessive risk-taking, and banks that are near collapse but are too big to fail will engage in even more of it.
Knowing that the government will pick up the pieces if necessary, they will postpone resolving mortgages and pay out billions in bonuses and dividends.
- Socializing losses while privatizing gains is more worrisome than the consequences of nationalizing banks.
American taxpayers are getting an increasingly bad deal.
In the first round of cash infusions, they got about $0.67 in assets for every dollar they gave (though the assets were almost surely overvalued, and quickly fell in value).
But in the recent cash infusions, it is estimated that Americans are getting $0.25, or less, for every dollar.
Bad terms mean a large national debt in the future.&nbsp; One reason we may be getting bad terms is that if we got fair value for our money, we would by now be the dominant shareholder in at least one of the major banks.
- Don’t confuse saving bankers and shareholders with saving banks.
America could have saved its banks, but let the shareholders go, for far less than it has spent.
- Trickle-down economics almost never works.
Throwing money at banks hasn’t helped homeowners: foreclosures continue to increase.
Letting AIG fail might have hurt some systemically important institutions, but dealing with that would have been better than to gamble upwards of $150 billion and hope that some of it might stick where it is important.
- Lack of transparency got the US financial system into this trouble.
Lack of transparency will not get it out.
The Obama administration is promising to pick up losses to persuade hedge funds and other private investors to buy out banks’ bad assets.
But this will not establish “market prices,” as the administration claims.
With the government bearing losses, these are distorted prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bank losses have already occurred, and their gains must now come at taxpayers’ expense.
Bringing in hedge funds as third parties will simply increase the cost.
- Better to be forward looking than backward looking, focusing on reducing the risk of new loans and ensuring that funds create new lending capacity.&nbsp; Bygone are bygones.&nbsp; As a point of reference, $700 billion provided to a new bank, leveraged 10 to 1, could have financed $7 trillion of new loans.&nbsp;
The era of believing that something can be created out of nothing should be over.
Short-sighted responses by politicians – who hope to get by with a deal that is small enough to please taxpayers and large enough to please the banks – will only prolong the problem. An impasse is looming.
More money will be needed, but Americans are in no mood to provide it – certainly not on the terms that have been seen so far. The well of money may be running dry, and so, too, may be America’s legendary optimism and hope.
How to Fight Secular Stagnation
MILAN – Much of the world, especially the advanced economies, has been mired in a pattern of slow and declining GDP growth in recent years, causing many to wonder whether this is becoming a semi-permanent condition – so-called “secular stagnation.”
The answer is probably yes, but the question lacks precision, and thus has limited utility.
There are, after all, different types of forces that could be suppressing growth, not all of which are beyond our control.
To be sure, there is a strong case to be made that many of the growth-destroying headwinds that we currently face would be difficult, if not impossible, to counter in the near term without endangering future growth and stability.
The result of these persistent conditions can be called “secular stagnation one” (SS1).
The first indication that we are experiencing SS1 relates to technology.
If we are, as the economist Robert Gordon argues, experiencing a slowdown in productivity-enhancing technological innovation, long-term potential growth would be constrained.
But even if innovation has not dropped off too much, or picks up again soon, the structural adaptation and behavioral changes needed to take advantage of the concomitant productivity gains will take time.
A second condition supporting SS1 is rooted in the impact of heightened uncertainty – about growth, job security, policies and regulations, and the many developments that could affect any of those factors – on investment and consumption.
People simply don’t know whether their governments are going to start making progress in combating deflationary pressure, countering rising inequality, addressing social and political fragmentation, and restoring economic growth and employment.
With future demand far from guaranteed, private investment has been declining in many countries, including, most recently, China.
The same goes for household consumption, particularly in the advanced economies, where a larger share of consumption is optional (for example, replacing consumer durables, traveling, and eating out at restaurants).
Given how long it took the US economy, for example, to recover fully from the Great Depression – until World War II, when the government took over much of the demand side of the economy – it seems that a reversal in these trends will not arrive anytime soon.
The third indication that we are stuck in SS1 is debt.
Households, corporations, financial institutions, and governments are all facing balance-sheet constraints, which it seems plausible to assume, are holding back expenditure and investment, elevating savings, and contributing to a broadly deflationary environment.
Actions aimed at supporting deleveraging and balance-sheet repair – such as recognizing losses, writing down assets, and recapitalizing banks – carry longer-term benefits but short-term costs.
Indeed, balance-sheet repair takes time, especially in the household sector, and produces an unavoidable drag on growth.
The picture is somewhat bleak.
But there is more to the story, revealed by another, more precise, question: is there a set of policy responses that could, over time, increase the level and quality of growth?
Here, the answer also seems to be yes, suggesting that we are also facing another type of secular stagnation – call it “secular stagnation two” (SS2) – that is dictated by our unwillingness or inability to implement the right policy mix.
A key element of that policy mix would focus on tackling rising inequality.
While the forces fueling this trend – in particular, globalization and progress in digital technology – will be difficult to counter fully, their adverse effects can be mitigated through redistribution via the tax and social-security systems.
As economies undergo prolonged structural transformations, individuals and families need the resources to invest in new skills.
Moreover, monetary policy, which has been shouldering much of the burden of recovery since the 2008 economic crisis, must be rethought.
The fact is that years of ultra-low interest rates and massive quantitative easing have not increased aggregate demand sufficiently, much less reduced deflationary forces adequately.
But raising interest rates unilaterally carries serious risks, because in a demand-constrained environment, higher interest rates attract capital inflows, thereby driving up the exchange rate and undermining growth in the tradable part of the economy.
Given this, advanced-country policymakers should consider imposing some controls on their capital accounts (much as successful emerging economies do) – a move that would facilitate more independent and tailored approaches to exiting financial repression.
A third priority should be to strengthen fiscal responses, especially with respect to public-sector investment.
Europe, in particular, is paying a heavy price for underusing its fiscal capacity – a decision that has been driven by the political unpopularity of debt and fiscal transfers.
Under the right conditions, the balance sheets of pension and sovereign-wealth funds could also be tapped to fund investment.
There are many more areas where countries may need to consider reforms. These include tax policy, the inefficient or improper use of public funds, impediments to structural change in product and factor markets, and mismatches between the reach of global financial institutions and the capacity of sovereign balance sheets to intervene in case of financial distress.
SS1 will make addressing SS2 much more difficult.
In fact, it seems that not even robust domestic and international policy responses would be sufficient to eliminate the risk that demand and growth will remain subdued for an extended period.
But that is no reason to delay action in the areas where policy can make a difference.
Just as our past policy choices helped to generate the SS1 we face today, failure to implement policies aimed at tackling SS2 could create a much more intractable and potentially unstable situation tomorrow.
National Governments, Global Citizens
CAMBRIDGE – Nothing endangers globalization more than the yawning governance gap – the dangerous disparity between the national scope of political accountability and the global nature of markets for goods, capital, and many services – that has opened up in recent decades.
When markets transcend national regulation, as with today’s globalization of finance, market failure, instability, and crisis is the result.
But pushing rule-making onto supranational bureaucracies, such as the World Trade Organization or the European Commission, can result in a democratic deficit and a loss of legitimacy.
How can this governance gap be closed?
One option is to re-establish national democratic control over global markets.
This is difficult and smacks of protectionism, but it is neither impossible nor necessarily inimical to healthy globalization.
As I argue in my book The Globalization Paradox, expanding the scope for national governments to maintain regulatory diversity and rebuild frayed social bargains would enhance the functioning of the global economy.
Instead, policy elites (and most economists) favor strengthening what is euphemistically called “global governance.”
According to this view, reforms such as those that enhance the effectiveness of the G-20, increase the representativeness of the International Monetary Fund’s Executive Board, and tighten the capital standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision would be sufficient to provide a sound institutional underpinning for the global economy.
But the trouble is not just that these global institutions remain weak. It is also that they are inter-governmental bodies – a collection of member states rather than agents of global citizens.
Because their accountability to national electorates is indirect and uncertain, they do not generate the political allegiance – and hence legitimacy – that truly representative institutions require.
Indeed, the travails of the European Union have revealed the limits of transnational political community-building, even among a comparatively limited and similar set of countries.
Ultimately, the buck stops with national parliaments and executives.
During the financial crisis, it was national governments that bailed out banks and firms, recapitalized the financial system, guaranteed debts, eased liquidity, primed the fiscal pump, and paid the unemployment and welfare checks – and took the blame for everything that went wrong.
In the memorable words of outgoing Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, global banks are “international in life, but national in death.”
But perhaps there is another path, one that accepts the authority of national governments, but aims to reorient national interests in a more global direction.
Progress along such a path requires “national” citizens to begin viewing themselves increasingly as “global” citizens, with interests that extend beyond their state’s borders.
National governments are accountable to their citizens, at least in principle. So, the more global these citizens’ sense of their interests becomes, the more globally responsible national policy will be.
This may seem like a pipedream, but something along these lines has already been happening for a while.
The global campaign for debt relief for poor countries was led by non-governmental organizations that successfully mobilized young people in rich countries to put pressure on their governments.
Multinational companies are well aware of the effectiveness of such citizen campaigns, having been compelled to increase transparency and change their ways on labor practices around the world.
Some governments have gone after foreign political leaders who committed human-rights crimes, with considerable domestic popular support.
Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, cites the example of a Ghanaian citizen providing testimony to the US Congress in the hope of convincing American officials to pressure the World Bank to change its position on user fees in Africa.
Such bottom-up efforts to “globalize” national governments have the greatest potential to affect environmental policies, particularly those aimed at mitigating climate change – the most intractable global problem of all.
Interestingly, some of the most important initiatives to stem greenhouse gases and promote green growth are the products of local pressures.
World Resources Institute President Andrew Steer notes that more than 50 developing countries are now implementing costly policies to reduce climate change.
From the perspective of national interest, that makes no sense at all, given the global-commons nature of the problem.
Some of these policies are driven by the desire to attain a competitive advantage, as is the case with China’s support for green industries.
But when voters are globally aware and environmentally conscious, good climate policy can also be good politics.
Consider California, which at the beginning of this year launched a cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020.
While global action remained stalled on capping emissions, environmental groups and concerned citizens successfully pushed for the plan over the opposition of business groups, and the state’s Republican governor at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger, signed it into law in 2006.
If it proves a success and remains popular, it could become a model for the entire country.
Global polls such as the World Values Survey indicate that there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered: self-expressed global citizenship tends to run 15-20 percentage points behind national citizenship.
But the gap is smaller for young people, the better educated, and the professional classes.
Those who consider themselves to be at the top of the class structure are significantly more globally minded than those who consider themselves to be from the lower classes.
Of course, “global citizenship” will always be a metaphor, because there will never be a world government administering a worldwide political community.
But the more we each think of ourselves as global citizens and express our preferences as such to our governments, the less we will need to pursue the chimera of global governance.
How to Help Burma
RANGOON – Across the Middle East, and now in Burma (Myanmar), one of the great questions of contemporary global politics has resurfaced: How can countries move from a failing authoritarianism to some form of self-sustaining pluralism?
Foreign ministers everywhere, in turn, face crucial policy questions: When a country launches such a political transition, when should other countries help, and what is the best way to do so?
Happy transitions, to paraphrase Tolstoy, are all alike; but every unhappy transition is unhappy in its own way.
The happy transitions across much of Central Europe following the end of the Cold War were made easier by the fact that the old communist order more or less died on its feet and surrendered power peacefully.
This, along with generous support from Western Europe, the United States, and others, helped to create a mood conducive to reconciliation, allowing each country to tackle in a measured, non-vengeful way the many difficult moral issues arising from the recent dark past.
Above all, perhaps, these transitions took place amidst a wider network of legitimate institutions – the European Union, OSCE, NATO, and the Council of Europe – championing the rule of law.
This supportive context provided a roadmap for national policymakers, helping them to build democratic institutions and marginalize extremists.
Elsewhere in the world, things are not so easy.
Discredited regimes may cling all the more ruthlessly and ruinously to power, as in Syria.
Or they may create all sorts of new problems on their way out of power, as in Libya.
Or they may be struggling to introduce democratic accountability while maintaining stability, as in Egypt.
In Burma, we see another model – a bold attempt after decades of military rule to move in a controlled but purposeful way toward a new, inclusive form of government. Here there are striking similarities to what happened in Poland as communism ended.
A military elite favors step-by-step reform, but wants to protect its position and is determined to avoid a descent into chaos.
The opposition is led by a charismatic leader with huge popular support.
And the ruling elite opens a number of parliamentary seats to a popular vote, only to be shocked by a landslide opposition win.
Moreover, as was true in Poland, Burma’s opposition leaders must strike a delicate balance: satisfy their impatient supporters (many of whom have suffered mightily under the old regime), while offering those still in power the prospect of a worthwhile future.
But there are key differences.
Burma has a very different internal political dynamic, not least because of the complex relationships among its various ethnic and linguistic communities – social cleavages that were not an issue in largely homogeneous Poland’s transition.
Moreover, unlike Poland when communism collapsed, Burma already has powerful business tycoons flourishing under the existing system – and they mean to maintain and develop their privileges.
Above all, there is no immediate international institutional context encouraging steady change and establishing standards and benchmarks: Burma must find its own path.
Earlier this month, I visited Burma, where I met President Thein Sein and the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as former political prisoners and many other activists.
I came away convinced that Burma is a country on the move – and moving firmly in a good direction.
All sides accept that this large and resource-rich country has under-performed for far too long.
They also agree that a step-by-step approach, based on reconciliation, is better than an open struggle for power, which could quickly take on a calamitous ethnic dimension.
That consensus will remain credible as long as political reform continues and economic growth accelerates.
After such a long period of stagnation, people demand to see and feel changes for the better in their own lives.
The rest of us should be constructive and creative, not prescriptive and pernickety.
Above all, we should be patient.
The EU’s suspension of sanctions and general readiness to engage constructively make sense.
Burma’s leadership should respond by releasing all remaining political prisoners and opening up the entire political process.
The EU also should ensure that its development assistance – and the process of delivering it – enhances pluralism and reconciliation by benefiting all of Burma’s communities fairly and transparently.
Poland is making its own direct contribution, above all by helping senior Burmese decision makers, opposition leaders, and business representatives to understand the “technology of transition” –&nbsp;that is, the sequencing of technical reforms, which has helped to make Poland one of Europe’s healthiest economies today.
Our business representatives came with me to present large-scale investment projects.
Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of my visit to Burma was a willingness to open up and learn from other countries that have navigated the painful transition from dictatorship to democracy.
One general asked me, off the record, “How did you manage to implement such dramatic political changes without bloodshed?”
A young woman at our democracy workshop told the assembled journalists and lecturers, “We thought that Burma was a one-off example.
Now we see that countries far away have had very similar experiences. We feel less lonely – it all worked out for you.”
Given that spirit – and appropriate foreign assistance – I am confident that it will all work out for Burma, too.
How to Help the Middle East
BEIRUT – In Lebanon today, all the symptoms of the Middle East’s current turmoil are visible.
Newly arrived refugees from Syria and Iraq are joining Palestinian refugees who have long been here.
The country hasn’t had a president for two years, as rival political factions, reflecting the rising enmity between their Iranian and Saudi Arabian backers, are weakening domestic governance.
Political corruption runs rampant.
The garbage doesn’t always get picked up.
But Lebanon also shows signs of resilience.
Investors and entrepreneurs are taking risks to start new businesses.
Civil-society groups are proposing and implementing useful initiatives.
Refugees are going to school.
Political enemies are collaborating to minimize security risks, and religious leaders advocate coexistence and tolerance.
Lebanon’s resilience owes much to the memory of its painful civil war (1975-1990).
By contrast, the rest of the region’s experiences – which involve a long history of autocratic governance and neglect of long-simmering grievances – have fanned the flames of conflict.
Syria, Iraq, and Yemen are now riven by war.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians’ worsening plight is still a perennial grievance on the Arab and Muslim street.
In this maelstrom, new radical groups with transnational agendas are blossoming.
In the last two years, conflicts have spilled over national borders, threatening global security.
The Islamic State has exploited long-standing Sunni grievances to challenge the territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, creating a strategic vacuum in which Russia, Iran, the United States, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia now vie for power, sometimes through proxies, but increasingly through direct military intervention.
Each country has its own agenda.
Iran seeks to project its influence in support of the region’s historically dominant Shia populations, while Saudi Arabia pushes back by arming rebel factions opposing Syria’s Iranian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad, and by fighting what it views as an Iranian presence in its own backyard, in Yemen.
As for Turkey, it opposes the creation of a Kurdish state, which became possible when Iraq and Syria came undone territorially.
With the region seemingly being sucked deeper into a vortex of permanent conflict, it is easy to believe that only dictators or religious bigots could impose any stability.
But to think that is to forget past progressive uprisings, such as in Beirut in 2005, Algiers and Tehran in 2009, and the Arab Spring that began in Tunisia and spread throughout the region in 2011.
To understand where the Middle East is going, we need to look further back to comprehend how the region arrived at this point.
Arab nationalism and its modernizing aspirations began to unravel after the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the 1986 oil-price collapse.
National leaders maintained control through repression and used Islamic opposition parties as scarecrows to avoid political reform.
National economies, weighed down by cronyism, delivered low growth, and governments lost legitimacy.
It was this strategy’s untenability that led in 2011 to the fall of regimes – in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere – that pursued it.
With no institutions left to ensure a peaceful political transition in these countries, violent groups had an advantage over ordinary citizens, and a crude fight for power ensued.
Violent revolutions can reach peaceful resolutions, but such an outcome is less likely where deep, unresolved sectarian grievances are in play, as they are in the Middle East.
The renewed salience of old, intractable cleavages – reflected in the grievances of Sunnis in Syria and Iraq, of Shias in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and of Kurds and Palestinians everywhere – makes the current situation especially precarious.
These problems were simmering beneath the surface of autocratic repression for decades.
Now, Pandora’s box has been opened, revealing an incredibly complex geopolitical puzzle.
The West deserves a share of the blame for the current situation.
It failed to end the long-standing Palestinian conflict, and it created new problems by dismantling the Iraqi state, funding mujahedeen in Afghanistan, and backing dictators who supported its security agenda in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere.
With the latest great-power interventions by the US and Russia, many are reminded of the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between Great Britain and France to draw new national borders in the region and divide it into spheres of influence.
But, if anything, Sykes-Picot provides a good model for what to avoid in rebuilding the Middle East.
The region does not need new borders and new protectorates, but rather better states, built to be resilient against ethnic divisions and less vulnerable to external influence.
Opinion polls indicate that the vast majority of people in the Middle East want to be governed by legitimate states that uphold the rule of law, protect civic rights, and promote coexistence among communities.
This is a worthy goal that will require compromise and reconciliation at a global, regional, and national level.
For national actors to have space to find solutions, it is necessary to de-escalate tensions and find compromises – first globally, between the US and Russia, and then regionally, among Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
The goal must be to reach a grand bargain that takes into account the major issues dividing the region, including the status of the Palestinians and Kurds, and creates conditions for viable political settlements in Syria and Iraq.
Addressing problems that have remained unsolved for decades is a tall order, but inaction is no longer affordable.
And none of the major fault lines of the Middle East can be resolved in isolation anymore.
As Antonio Gramsci argued long ago in his Prison Notebooks, “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born, and in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”
That is the Middle East’s situation in a nutshell.
Helping it build a new regional order will require all actors, great and small, to accept compromise, as the Lebanese have done.
A war that leaves one side vanquished is never over.
A Eurasian Solution for Europe’s Crises
MOSCOW – More than 18 months after former President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power (and into exile), the crisis in Ukraine is at a stalemate.
Crimea has been reabsorbed by Russia (in what many consider an annexation); much of eastern Ukraine is held by pro-Russia rebels; and relations between the West and Russia are more tense than at any time since the early days of the Cold War.
But can anyone claim an advantage?
Those who wanted to see Ukraine anchored in the West, or imagined that sanctions on Russia would incite regime change in the Kremlin, by palace coup or popular uprising, have seen their hopes dashed: President Vladimir Putin’s popularity is as high as ever.
In Russia, those who predicted the immediate collapse of Ukraine and the establishment in its eastern and southern provinces of a pro-Russian “Novorossia” have been similarly disappointed.
The tragedy is that the price of these illusions has been extraordinarily high in human terms – the ceasefire-defying death toll in eastern Ukraine has risen to more than 6,000 since April 2014 – and dangerously high in geostrategic terms as well.
It looks like both sides are ready to fight “to the last Ukrainian.”
As I have long argued, Russia was never likely to yield.
After being pushed to the wall by more than two decades of Western expansion – be it European Union or NATO enlargement – into a part of Europe that it considers vital to its national security, Russians believe that they have the moral high ground in defending their interests.
The danger now, with both sides trading accusations in an atmosphere of mutual distrust, is that the current stalemate will lead to a much deeper crisis between Russia and the West.
Both sides need to find a solution; yet, despite emerging victorious from the Cold War, the West seems not only to have lost the peace, but is on the verge of re-dividing Europe.
And this is occurring at a time when the entire continent, including Russia and many other Eurasian states, is facing the threat of Islamic extremism.
It is also happening at a time when both parts of Europe are in search of a new geopolitical, or even spiritual, identity.
While the EU wrestles with problems of migration and integration, Russia is drifting away from a Eurocentric cultural and economic course toward a Eurasian alternative.
And the United States – at least under President Barack Obama – has retreated into a kind of semi-isolation, leaving behind troubling zones of instability and unresolved crises.
So what will happen next?
With both Western and Eastern Europe beset by political conflict and economic stagnation, the five centuries of European global dominance are drawing to an end.
The reality now, following the end of the bipolar supremacy of the US and the Soviet Union and a brief “unipolar” phase following the Soviet Union’s collapse, is that we are now in a “multipolar” world.
This, too, may prove temporary as two new geopolitical macro-blocs gain strength in the twenty-first century.
One centers on the US and its ambition to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
The second macro-bloc is “Greater Eurasia,” featuring China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and possibly India.
Strong foundations for this project were established with the May 2015 agreement between Russia and China to coordinate the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) with President Xi Jinping’s “Silk Road” initiative, which aims to bind Central Asia’s economies and those farther to the west closer to China’s.
The question is whether this Greater Eurasia can help Europe find a way through its current security impasse.
Some in Europe will doubtless prefer to strengthen the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe – but the truth is that the OSCE, burdened by its Cold War history and its failure to secure the post-Cold War peace, is too tarnished to play a decisive role.
An alternative might be a dialogue between the EU and the EEU, but that would be tricky as the EEU pursues a closer relationship with China and its Silk Road allies.
A better approach would be to invite – sooner rather than later – China and Eurasian states to create over time a common economic space from Shanghai to Lisbon.
There is obvious potential for the EU to engage constructively with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (created in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, with India and Pakistan set to join next year).
The failure of the old framework demands an effort to create a new one, beginning with a dialogue on Eurasian development cooperation and security that involves China and both Eurasian and European countries.
None of this will render the OSCE or NATO redundant, and that should be no one’s goal.
What matters in resolving today’s conflicts, be they active or supposedly “frozen,” is to build a broader framework of cooperation and dialogue between the EU and what I term Greater Eurasia.
The remaining question in such a scenario concerns the role of the US.
Does it really want to remain in semi-isolation, hoping to be called back to center stage at some unlikely “unipolar moment” in the future?
Let us hope for an America ready to act as a responsible player in a fairer world.
Women and the World Economy
WASHINGTON, DC – In many countries, public debate about gender equality focuses mainly on women's access to top positions and high-powered career opportunities.
But the “glass ceiling" is only a small part of the issue.
The broader question is whether women have the same opportunities as men to participate in labor markets in the first place.
In other words, are women empowered to contribute fully to global economic growth and prosperity?
Unfortunately, the International Monetary Fund's latest study by its staff, “Women, Work, and the Economy," shows that, despite some improvements, progress toward leveling the playing field for women has stalled.
This is bad news for everyone, because it translates into lower economic growth – amounting to as much as 27% of per capita GDP in some countries.
Around the world, the number of women in the workforce remains far below that of men; only about half of working-age women are employed.
Women account for most unpaid work, and when they are paid, they are overrepresented in the informal sector and among the poor.
They continue to be paid less than men for the same jobs, even in OECD countries, where the average gender wage gap is about 16%.
And in many countries, distortions and discrimination in the labor market restrict women's chances of equal pay and rising to senior positions.
The potential gains from a larger female workforce are striking.
In Egypt, for example, if the number of female workers were raised to the same level as that of men, the country's GDP could grow by 34%.
In the United Arab Emirates, GDP would expand by 12%, in Japan by 9%, and in the United States by 5%.
According to a recent study based on data from the International Labor Organization, of the 865 million women worldwide who could contribute more fully to their economies, 812 million live in emerging and developing countries.
Raising women's labor-market participation rate boosts economic performance in a number of ways.
For example, higher incomes for women lead to higher household spending on educating girls – a key prerequisite for faster long-term growth.
Employment of women on an equal basis with men provides companies with a larger talent pool, potentially increasing creativity, innovation, and productivity.
And, in advanced countries, a larger female labor force can help to counteract the impact of a shrinking workforce and mitigate the costs of an aging population.
So what underlies the persistence of gaping inequality and stalled progress?
Legal, regulatory, and social discrimination against women in many countries still prevents them from seeking paid work in the formal sector.
As a result, women dominate the informal economy, where jobs are often transient and earnings are low.
In addition, tax systems and social-welfare programs in many countries are designed in ways that discourage women from working.
Against this background, government tax and spending policies, as well as labor-market regulation, should be reformed to help boost female employment.
For example, taxing individual rather than family income – which in many economies imposes a higher marginal tax on the second earner in households – would encourage women to seek employment.
Linking social-welfare benefits to participation in the workforce, training, or active labor-market programs also can help, as can affordable, high-quality childcare and greater opportunities for paternity and maternity leave.
In Brazil, for example, the share of women in the workforce has risen sharply over the past 20 years, from about 45% to almost 60%, owing in part to family-friendly policies.
These are just a few examples; far more can be done.
Women benefit when flexible work arrangements are introduced and the barriers between part-time and full-time work contracts are lowered, as the Netherlands has successfully done.
In developing countries, accessible water and better transportation systems in rural areas can help women manage their time better.
Establishing and upholding equal property and inheritance rights can increase women's access to credit and other productive resources, and creating greater awareness of legal rights in general will help reduce discrimination.
Some of these steps have been taken in recent years, but it is time to jumpstart the process.
We urge policymakers to take action and implement policies aimed at removing the obstacles that block women's participation in the workforce.
We at the IMF will do our part by enhancing our analysis of the economic effects of gender inequality and working with our member countries to enable women to contribute fully to global economic growth and prosperity.
Especially now, with the growth outlook uncertain in much of the world, policies that encourage more women to enter the workforce certainly can help.
Women are ready, willing, and able.
Take my word for it.
How to Keep a New Year’s Resolution
MELBOURNE – Did you make any New Year’s resolutions?
Perhaps you resolved to get fit, to lose weight, to save more money, or to drink less alcohol.
Or your resolution may have been more altruistic: to help those in need, or to reduce your carbon footprint.
But are you keeping your resolution?
We are not yet far into 2010, but studies show that fewer than half of those who make New Year’s resolutions manage to keep them for as long as one month.
What does this tell us about human nature, and our ability to live either prudently or ethically?
Part of the problem, of course, is that we make resolutions to do only things that we are not otherwise likely to do.
Only an anorexic would resolve to eat ice cream at least once a week, and only a workaholic would resolve to spend more time in front of the television.
So we use the occasion of the New Year to try to change behavior that may be the most difficult to change. That makes failure a distinct possibility.
Nevertheless, presumably we make resolutions because we have decided that it would be best to do whatever it is that we are resolving to do.
But if we have already made that decision, why don’t we just do it?
From Socrates onwards, that question has puzzled philosophers.
In the Protagoras, one of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates says that no one chooses what they know to be bad.
Hence choosing what is bad is a kind of error: people will do it only if they think that it is good.
If we can teach people what is best, Socrates and Plato seem to have thought, they will do it.
But that is a hard doctrine to swallow – much harder than eating the extra slice of cake that you know is not good for you.
Aristotle took a different view, one that fits better with our everyday experience of failing to do what we know to be best.
Our reason may tell us what is best to do, he thought, but in a particular moment our reason may be overwhelmed by emotion or desire.
Thus, the problem is not lack of knowledge, but the failure of our reason to master other, non-rational aspects of our nature.
That view is supported by recent scientific work showing that much of our behavior is based on very rapid, instinctive, emotionally based responses.
Although we are capable of deciding what to do on the basis of rational thought processes, such decisions often prove less powerful than our instinctive feelings in moving us to action.
What does this have to do with keeping resolutions?
Richard Holton, a professor of philosophy at MIT and the author of Willing, Wanting, Waiting, points out that a resolution is an attempt to overcome the problem of maintaining an intention when we expect that, at some future time, we will face inclinations contrary to our intention.
Right now, we want to lose weight and we are rationally convinced that this is more important than the pleasure we will get from that extra slice of cake.
But we anticipate that, faced with cake tomorrow, our desire for that rich chocolate texture will distort our reasoning so that we might convince ourselves that putting on just a little more weight doesn’t really matter all that much.
To prevent that, we seek to shore up our current intention to lose weight.
By making a solemn resolution and telling our family and close friends about it, we tilt the scales against succumbing to temptation.
If we fail to keep our resolution, we will have to admit that we are less in control of our behavior than we had hoped, thus losing face in our own eyes and in the eyes of others about whom we care.
This fits well with what psychologists have discovered about how we can improve the odds that we will keep our resolutions.
Richard Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, has tracked 5,000 people who made New Year’s resolutions. Only about one in ten managed to stick to what they had resolved.
In his recently released book 59 Seconds, Wiseman sets out the things that you can do to make success more likely:
·         Break your resolution into a series of small steps;
·         Tell your family and friends about your resolution, thus both gaining support and increasing the personal cost of failure;
·         Regularly remind yourself of the benefits of achieving your goal;
·         Give yourself a small reward each time you achieve one of the steps towards your goal;
·         Keep track of your progress towards your goal, for example by keeping a journal or putting a chart on the fridge door.
Individually, each of these factors seems trivial.
Collectively, they are ways of exerting our self-control not only now, but in the future as well.
If we succeed, the behavior we judge to be better will become habitual – and thus no longer require a conscious act of will to keep acting in that way.
These tools for keeping a New Year’s resolution can help us to make progress, not only in losing weight or staying out of debt, but also in living more ethically.
We may even find that that is the best resolution to make, for our own benefit and that of others.
How to Make EU Integration Popular
Across the European Union, fears about globalization and antipathy to integration and immigration have produced massive political fallout, including the failed French and Dutch referenda on the Union’s draft constitutional treaty and a de facto moratorium on accession talks with Turkey.
The European Council and the Commission have watched helplessly, as if the matter was not in their hands.
Conventional wisdom suggests that the EU’s inability to meet the challenges of integration is due to rigid economic structures and inadequate human capital – weaknesses that can only be tackled effectively by national policies, where the Union has little role to play.
But substantial policy spillover across the EU justifies strengthened policy coordination for labor-market and welfare reform.
Outdated labor-market rules are the key reason why the full benefits of the internal market and monetary union have failed to materialize.
Labor-market rigidities – above all in France, Germany, and Italy – impede adjustment to the increased competition of integrating markets.
Those who lose their jobs cannot find new ones because of barriers to entry, while high long-term unemployment makes those who do have jobs feel threatened.
Viewing immigrants and internal market integration with alarm, both groups thus have increasingly turned against Europe.
If they cannot reform, France or Italy eventually may be tempted to renege on free movement of goods, services and labor – and perhaps even abandon the euro – with disruptive consequences for all members.
Therefore, there is a common interest in fostering national policies that are consistent with integration in the internal market.
The benefits of coordination are likely to be reinforced by policy “learning,” as confirmed by evidence that reforms tend to spread in waves.
Structural reforms are usually resisted because of uncertainty about the costs and their distribution.
One way to weaken this resistance is to involve not only ministers and heads of government in exchanging information on policy design, but also those who resist change, notably trade unions.
After all, a clear message by the European Council would have a much stronger effect if it expressed not only the wishes of heads of governments, but also broad acceptance at all levels of society.
Only then can one hope for full implementation of reforms and the virtuous circle of improved expectations and economic performance that should have been set in motion by the European Council’s Lisbon summit seven years ago.
The experience of successful reform in the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic countries shows that Europe need not be condemned to stagnation, provided that it renounces rigid employment protection.
The key to overcoming resistance is to give affected workers grounds to hope that they can find a new job.
The European Council might also recommend that any relaxation of employment protection be accompanied by the establishment of a minimum wage – determined as an agreed proportion of the statutory wage for regular long-term employment.
With such a comprehensive policy package, resistance to change would likely diminish.
Immigration poses even greater policy challenges, since newcomers are widely perceived as threatening jobs and crowding out natives from social services.
There is ample evidence that restrictions on immigration in one country divert migrant flows to other EU countries, and that migration is attracted by generous welfare entitlements.
Moreover, well-functioning labor markets attract migrants with higher qualifications, while countries with rigid employment protection are targeted by the low-skilled and those willing to work illegally.
Labor migration also presents challenges for source countries, for it diminishes their pool of young and educated workers.
Policy coordination can provide effective remedies to these negative spillovers.
Two measures would be particularly useful.
First, the old member states should immediately lift remaining restrictions on the freedom of movement for workers from new member countries.
Any minimum wage would automatically also apply to immigrant workers, mitigating “unfair” competition for low-skilled jobs. 
Second, the EU should enact a common scheme for admission of immigrant workers from outside the Union.
Such a scheme should include a “point system” for selecting applicants for residence and work permits, which would assign each applicant a score based on objective criteria, typically including language ability, education, and experience.
This approach has been successfully implemented in Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland; Germany and Great Britain are following suit.
By establishing a common “welfare floor” throughout the EU, providing an effective safety net to native workers whose jobs are threatened by integration, and adopting a coordinated policy on immigration, European citizens would be reassured.
This, in turn, might reduce their hostility to migrant workers while offering migrants an equitable and fair legal framework.
These labor-market and immigration policies should become the focus of policy coordination within the EU.
By concentrating on policies to sustain integration while at the same preserving the European social model, the European Council would again become a relevant policy forum where the real needs and hopes of citizens could find effective responses.
New Model Europe
ROME – It is becoming increasingly clear that if Europe is to overcome its crisis, business as usual will not suffice.
We need a Europe that is more concrete, less rhetorical, and better suited to the current global economy.
We need to focus not only on the European Union’s specific policies, but also on how to change its “politics” – a change that must place economic growth at the top of the agenda.
Europe does not need a debate between austerity and growth; it needs to be pragmatic.
A good example of this was the most recent European Council, which addressed two of Europe’s most pressing problems: malfunctioning labor markets, reflected in record-high youth unemployment, and malfunctioning credit markets, in which access to financing is difficult and lending rates vary considerably among different parts of the single market.
The outcome of the Council’s June meeting was encouraging, and we must continue on that path in the coming months to make progress on two equally important issues: how to foster innovation and the digital economy, and how to ensure Europe’s manufacturing competitiveness.
We need to assess what can be achieved at the national level and what EU institutions should do.
Fiscal consolidation and national reforms are essential and should continue.
But we can better achieve our objectives under an EU framework that supports, rather than impedes, national action to boost growth and employment.
The European Commission’s recent decision to grant member states some flexibility for productive public investment linked to EU structural funds is a welcome step in this direction.
The second issue is the need to take further steps toward closer integration within the eurozone.
A banking union is an important start, which should prevent financial markets from fragmenting along national lines and reduce private-sector borrowing costs.
Lending rates are still too high for small and medium-size enterprises and too dependent on where in the EU a company is located.
We have achieved important results on the way to a banking union, notably on supervision.
Now we need to work on the second pillar, resolution of the banking crisis.
The proposal presented by Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, is bold, but Europe does indeed need a strong, efficient resolution mechanism that ensures timely action to address banking crises.
We also need to consider how to enhance coordination of economic policies to promote productivity convergence.
We already have a good mechanism for multilateral surveillance in place, but we should aim to focus it on the areas that really matter for economic union.
This must go hand in hand with a discussion of how the EU can provide incentives to member states that are committed to difficult structural reforms at a time of retrenchment, which could lead to talks about possible forms of fiscal coordination.
Though it is premature to enter into such discussions now, the issue should not be taken off the table.
All of these changes concern the eurozone’s members first, of course, but they are clearly relevant for the wider EU.
At the same time, setting eurozone members apart from the wider EU would be inadvisable.
Ensuring a stable and effective eurozone is essential to the smooth operation of the entire single market.
And, without an efficient EU, the eurozone could not prosper.
We have only one Europe, and we all need to work together to reform it and drive it forward.
Indeed, with its 500 million consumers, the EU single market remains the largest destination for goods and services worldwide and is the best engine to restore growth.
Key economic sectors, such as financial services, benefit greatly from the single market’s common rules.
Without the single market, all member states would be less attractive to foreign investors, who, once established in one member state, can move freely around the EU.
The single market also provides a platform and leverage to export goods and services to international markets.
So we must make the single market more open, internally and externally.
But, to do so, we will need to make EU institutions more efficient, with better regulation and a lower administrative burden.
Common institutions are needed to ensure that all EU countries’ interests are protected, and to act as a bridge between eurozone and non-eurozone member states.
Frankly, the functioning of the EU and its institutions during the crisis has been a part of the problem.
For many people, EU decision-making is opaque, inefficient, and removed from democratic control.
Most worrying, the crisis has challenged the very idea of European integration.
Thus, we will be able to advance a reformist agenda only if we have a convincing narrative that explains why we need Europe and why it serves the interests of current and future generations.
I am a committed pro-European.
I have in mind the extraordinary image of Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand at Verdun in 1984, two old leaders, standing hand in hand, remembering the victims of World War I.
Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of that war.
The experience of two world wars was foundational for European integration.
But these memories no longer provide a sufficient catalyst for action.
We need to find a forward-looking rationale that, after 50 years of integration, shows how acting together can help Europe achieve its goals in a changed global environment.
There is nothing worse than letting people believe that European integration is something that proceeds by stealth, a journey driven by invisible and uncontrollable forces.
The EU cannot last unless it is built on its citizens’ explicit commitment.
Today, we have a chance to remodel Europe.
Next year’s European parliamentary elections will provide an opportunity for a fundamental debate about the EU’s future.
Unless we make a successful case for Europe (and for a different Europe), Euro-skeptic forces will gain ground and Europe’s decision-making processes will be blocked.
The choice is clear, and it will have to be made sooner rather than later.
Escape from Mecca
LOS ANGELES – The recent stampede in Mecca, in which more than a thousand pilgrims making the hajj were trampled to death, is a tragic but powerful reminder of the city’s prominence in the Muslim world.
According to theological tradition, every Muslim is required to make a trip to the city once in their lifetime, if they are able to do so.
In practice, however, it is only in recent times that making a pilgrimage to Mecca has come to play such an important role in Islam.
The city has always had symbolic significance, but its importance to millions of Muslims worldwide is largely a modern phenomenon, one that has grown in recent decades as Saudi officials and fundamentalist Wahhabi clerics promoted religious tourism as a means of spreading their influence.
For most of Islamic history, the overwhelmingly majority of Muslims did not travel to Mecca.
Instead, they made local pilgrimages to the major shrines that still garland the Muslim world.
Some are to Koranic prophets even older than Muhammad; others are to Shia imams or Sufi saints; and still others are to hallowed Muslim women.
The name of one holy place, the necropolis of Makli in Pakistan, hints at its medieval ambition to become an alternative destination for pilgrims: Makli means the “little Mecca.”
The modern hajj has its origins in the rise of religious tourism to Mecca in the nineteenth century, when steamships began transporting large numbers of pilgrims to the Arabian Peninsula.
Then, as now, there was little local effort to limit the number of pilgrims to safe levels or to provide adequate infrastructure and security to handle the masses of visitors.
Annual influxes of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims closely packed into steamships were blamed for spreading cholera through port cities from Bombay to Hamburg, making the hajj a major cause of death around the world.
For the most part, the pilgrimage’s religious nature has muted criticism of the way it was handled.
But contemporary accounts make clear that not all were pleased with Mecca’s management of the event.
In the 1860s, the female Indian Muslim ruler of Bhopal, Sikandar Begum, wrote a warts-and-all account of Mecca as a “wild and melancholy-looking” city whose “dirty and ill-drained” streets were filled with disease and disorder.
A half-century later, the Central Asian pilgrim ‘Abd al-Rashid Ibrahim described the holy city’s filth and squalor, recounting stories of pilgrims walking through streets ankle deep in excrement.
Religious tourism played a central role in the region’s nineteenth-century economy (until the arrival of Texas oilmen in the 1930s, Mecca was almost entirely dependent on visiting pilgrims).
But the numbers of visitors began to rise sharply after the city fell under the control of the Saudi royal family in 1924.
Until then, the only way to reach Mecca was by pack animal.
The Ottoman Empire raised funds from pious Muslims (and brought in German technicians) to lay a railway from Damascus to Medina.
But the last leg of the journey – to Mecca itself – remained a monopoly of the camel-owning Bedouin.
When the Saudi government introduced Fords to the area in around 1930, it needed all of its military resources to prevent the Bedouin from destroying them.
To be sure, the Saudi government faces massive demand from Muslims to be allowed to make the hajj, and it has introduced a quota system to limit their numbers.
Even so, it maintains strenuous efforts to attract pilgrims – particularly wealthy ones – by building attractions, including vast shopping malls and a colossal copy of London’s Big Ben that now looms incongruously over the Ka‘ba.
And the authorities’ admission of more pilgrims than the city’s infrastructure can safely handle is indisputable; the proof is repeated disasters like the one in September.
Indeed, since taking control of Mecca, the Saudi government has used the city and the hajj as centerpieces in its efforts to place the kingdom at the center of the Muslim world and spread Wahhabi Islam.
As soon as the Saudi royal family seized the city, the new rulers destroyed the Shia and Sufi shrines that might have undermined their sought-after monopoly over the ritual aspects of the pilgrimage.
And their approach seems to have worked.
It is not uncommon for pilgrims from, say, India or Indonesia to adopt strict, conservative tenets after their return from Mecca.
As influence is ultimately a matter of numbers, it should come as no surprise that the Saudis seek to maximize the inflows of Muslim pilgrims each year.
Even when faced with calamitous death tolls, the Saudi establishment is unlikely to change its approach.
It is up to the rest of the Muslim world to provide alternatives to the modern idea, championed by Saudi Wahhabis and other arch-conservatives, that Mecca is the inexorable and inevitable center of the Muslim world.
There is nothing stopping Muslim governments from taking a page out of the Saudi handbook and promoting the neglected shrines in their own territories.
Doing so would not only reduce the number of pilgrims traveling to Mecca, making the visits safer; it would also force Saudi Arabia to share the enormous profits of religious tourism.
Even more important, moving beyond the modern hajj to a more plural pattern of pilgrimage could help stem the Wahhabi takeover of the faith.
How to Make Trade Easier
WASHINGTON, DC – The world is now in the fourth year of the Great Recession.
So far, the economies belonging to the World Trade Organization have resisted the kind of widespread protectionism that would make a bad situation much worse.
But protectionist pressures are building as weary politicians hear more and more calls for economic nationalism.
The WTO’s best defense of open trade is a good offense.
A new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement would benefit all by increasing developing countries’ capacity to trade, strengthening the WTO’s development mandate, and boosting global economic growth.
More than a decade after the launch of the Doha Round of global free-trade talks, this agreement could be a down payment on the commitment that WTO members have made to linking trade and development.
Developing countries stand to gain the most from improving trade facilitation.
The right support would help traders in poorer countries to compete and integrate into global supply chains.
There are rich opportunities for gains.
Inefficiencies in processing and clearing goods put traders in developing countries at a competitive disadvantage.&nbsp;Outdated and inefficient border procedures and inadequate infrastructure often mean high transaction costs, long delays, opportunities for corruption, and an additional 10-15% in the cost of getting goods to market – even more in landlocked countries.
Research by the World Bank suggests that every dollar of assistance provided to support trade-facilitation reform in developing countries yields a return of up to $70 in economic benefits.
When funds are directed at improving border-management systems and procedures – the very issues covered by the trade-facilitation negotiations – the impact is particularly significant.
Projects aimed at boosting efficiency and transparency, supported by development banks and bilateral donors, have made a dramatic difference.&nbsp;In East Africa, procedural improvements have reduced the average clearance time for cargo crossing the Kenya-Uganda border from almost two days to only seven hours.
In Cameroon, some of our organizations have worked with the World Customs Organization to help the customs authority reduce corruption and increase collection of revenues – estimated to be more than $25 million a year.
On the Laos-Vietnam border, a sub-regional cross-border transport agreement has cut cargo transit times from four hours to just over one hour.
A new customs component to a highway project between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City helped increase the total value of trade through the Moc Bai-Bavet border by 40% over three years.
In Peru, some of our banks have worked with international freight forwarders to connect remote villages and small businesses to export markets through national postal services, turning more than 300 small firms into exporters, most for the first time.
The outlines of a new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement are already clear, but some technical differences remain on specific provisions.
Developing countries want a credible commitment to support implementation, such as technical assistance and capacity-building.&nbsp;A World Bank study estimates that the costs of implementing the measures likely to be covered by a Trade Facilitation agreement would be relatively modest – $7-11 million in the countries studied, spread out over a number of years – especially when compared to the expected benefits.
Capacity-building and financing programs for governments that want to improve their trade facilitation are available already.
Major donor countries and international development organizations have put a priority on, and increased investment in, trade facilitation.&nbsp;According to the OECD, from 2002 to 2010, trade facilitation-related assistance increased ten-fold in real terms, from almost $40 million to nearly $400 million.
The African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the World Bank stand ready – alongside the WTO – to assist developing countries through the process of full and effective implementation of the agreement.
That means helping countries to assess their trade-facilitation needs on a case-by-case basis, match those needs with the resources required, and broker partnerships between recipient countries and development allies to ensure that support is provided quickly and efficiently.
In international negotiations, there is always a way forward if the benefits of an agreement are shared by all.
Trade facilitation offers a development dividend for all countries.
It is time for WTO members to make progress on issues where there is room to do so.
It will be a down payment on a solid investment.
How to Prevent a Depression
AMSTERDAM – The latest economic data suggests that recession is returning to most advanced economies, with financial markets now reaching levels of stress unseen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The risks of an economic and financial crisis even worse than the previous one – now involving not just the private sector, but also near-insolvent sovereigns – are significant.
So, what can be done to minimize the fallout of another economic contraction and prevent a deeper depression and financial meltdown?
First, we must accept that austerity measures, necessary to avoid a fiscal train wreck, have recessionary effects on output.
So, if countries in the eurozone’s periphery are forced to undertake fiscal austerity, countries able to provide short-term stimulus should do so and postpone their own austerity efforts.
These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the core of the eurozone, and Japan.
Infrastructure banks that finance needed public infrastructure should be created as well.
Second, while monetary policy has limited impact when the problems are excessive debt and insolvency rather than illiquidity, credit easing, rather than just quantitative easing, can be helpful.
The European Central Bank should reverse its mistaken decision to hike interest rates.
More monetary and credit easing is also required for the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank.
Inflation will soon be the last problem that central banks will fear, as renewed slack in goods, labor, real estate, and commodity markets feeds disinflationary pressures.
Third, to restore credit growth, eurozone banks and banking systems that are under-capitalized should be strengthened with public financing in a European Union-wide program.
To avoid an additional credit crunch as banks deleverage, banks should be given some short-term forbearance on capital and liquidity requirements.
Also, since the US and EU financial systems remain unlikely to provide credit to small and medium-size enterprises, direct government provision of credit to solvent but illiquid SMEs is essential.
Fourth, large-scale liquidity provision for solvent governments is necessary to avoid a spike in spreads and loss of market access that would turn illiquidity into insolvency.
Even with policy changes, it takes time for governments to restore their credibility.
Until then, markets will keep pressure on sovereign spreads, making a self-fulfilling crisis likely.
Today, Spain and Italy are at risk of losing market access.
Official resources need to be tripled – through a larger European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Eurobonds, or massive ECB action – to avoid a disastrous run on these sovereigns.
Fifth, debt burdens that cannot be eased by growth, savings, or inflation must be rendered sustainable through orderly debt restructuring, debt reduction, and conversion of debt into equity.
This needs to be carried out for insolvent governments, households, and financial institutions alike.
Sixth, even if Greece and other peripheral eurozone countries are given significant debt relief, economic growth will not resume until competitiveness is restored.
And, without a rapid return to growth, more defaults – and social turmoil – cannot be avoided.
There are three options for restoring competitiveness within the eurozone, all requiring a real depreciation – and none of which is viable:
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp weakening of the euro towards parity with the US dollar, which is unlikely, as the US is weak, too.
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rapid reduction in unit labor costs, via acceleration of structural reform and productivity growth relative to wage growth, is also unlikely, as that process took 15 years to restore competitiveness to Germany.
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A five-year cumulative 30% deflation in prices and wages – in Greece, for example – which would mean five years of deepening and socially unacceptable depression; even if feasible, this amount of deflation would exacerbate insolvency, given a 30% increase in the real value of debt.
Because these options cannot work, the sole alternative is an exit from the eurozone by Greece and some other current members.
Only a return to a national currency – and a sharp depreciation of that currency – can restore competitiveness and growth.
Leaving the common currency would, of course, threaten collateral damage for the exiting country and raise the risk of contagion for other weak eurozone members.
The balance-sheet effects on euro debts caused by the depreciation of the new national currency would thus have to be handled through an orderly and negotiated conversion of euro liabilities into the new national currencies.
Appropriate use of official resources, including for recapitalization of eurozone banks, would be needed to limit collateral damage and contagion.
Seventh, the reasons for advanced economies’ high unemployment and anemic growth are structural, including the rise of competitive emerging markets.
The appropriate response to such massive changes is not protectionism.
Instead, the advanced economies need a medium-term plan to restore competitiveness and jobs via massive new investments in high-quality education, job training and human-capital improvements, infrastructure, and alternative/renewable energy.
Only such a program can provide workers in advanced economies with the tools needed to compete globally.
Eighth, emerging-market economies have more policy tools left than advanced economies do, and they should ease monetary and fiscal policy.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can serve as lender of last resort to emerging markets at risk of losing market access, conditional on appropriate policy reforms.
And countries, like China, that rely excessively on net exports for growth should accelerate reforms, including more rapid currency appreciation, in order to boost domestic demand and consumption.
The risks ahead are not just of a mild double-dip recession, but of a severe contraction that could turn into Great Depression II, especially if the eurozone crisis becomes disorderly and leads to a global financial meltdown.
Wrong-headed policies during the first Great Depression led to trade and currency wars, disorderly debt defaults, deflation, rising income and wealth inequality, poverty, desperation, and social and political instability that eventually led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and World War II.
The best way to avoid the risk of repeating such a sequence is bold and aggressive global policy action now.
The Egypt-Israel Peace Test
WASHINGTON, DC – The rocket strikes that a militant Islamist group recently fired from the Egyptian Sinai into the Israeli city of Eilat served as yet another reminder of how delicate bilateral relations remain two years after Egypt’s revolution.
Terrorist activity could easily cause a crisis on the border, with the potential to trigger an unwanted confrontation that would threaten the peace treaty that normalized bilateral relations in 1979.
To avoid such an outcome, Israel and Egypt must take convincing action now to uphold the treaty.
Last November, when hostilities erupted in Gaza, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi mediated a swift resolution, even providing a guarantee for the cease-fire with Gaza’s ruling Hamas.
Morsi thus implicitly recommitted Egypt to upholding peace on the border and to playing a constructive role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
This boosted confidence in Israel that the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s ruling party, would uphold the 1979 peace treaty.
But Morsi has not explicitly endorsed peace with Israel and has avoided direct engagement with Israeli leaders.
Preserving peace is in both countries’ interests.
The attack on an Egyptian army outpost in the Sinai last summer, in which armed militants killed 16 soldiers, demonstrated that terrorism threatens Egypt just as it does Israel.
In this volatile environment, reverting to a confrontational relationship with Israel would be extremely dangerous, inviting the risk of another disastrous war.
Upholding the peace treaty with Israel would have the opposite effect, enabling Egypt to pursue its goals of consolidating the military’s authority at home and enhancing its influence throughout the Middle East.
Egyptian and Israeli leaders must recognize that the ongoing struggle to secure the Sinai Peninsula – which the treaty established as a demilitarized zone – is testing peace daily.
Israel has so far tolerated Egyptian military activity and force deployments that technically violate the bilateral treaty, approving them retroactively in the hope that Egypt will do more to secure the border and crack down on weapons smuggling into Gaza.
But Israel has little confidence that the deployments will enhance its security, and Israeli leaders are becoming increasingly anxious about the Egyptian military’s mobilization of forces without notice.
In Egypt, the treaty is even more clearly under threat.
The Muslim Brotherhood has long called for a referendum on the treaty, viewing the restrictions on Egyptian forces in the Sinai as an affront to national sovereignty.
The Brothers condemned Morsi’s involvement in resolving the Gaza crisis last year, portraying it as kowtowing to Israel.
In fact, Morsi is under fire from both the left and the right for upholding former President Hosni Mubarak’s obliging approach to Israel, as well as for reasserting Mubarak’s authoritarian bargain – diplomatic and financial support in exchange for “stability” – with the United States.
Faced with a collapsing economy and approaching elections, the temptation for Morsi to stoke nationalist, anti-Israel sentiment will become stronger.
A major incident on the border could be enough to push him over the edge.
In order to sustain the peace treaty, Egypt and Israel should renegotiate its military annex to allow Egypt to deploy forces in previously restricted zones and re-establish full sovereignty over the Sinai.
Such a move would strengthen bilateral relations, generate goodwill in Egypt, and increase Israel’s confidence in the Muslim Brotherhood’s commitment to peace.
During such a renegotiation, the two countries would discuss in detail the most effective approach to tackling their shared challenges related to terrorism and transnational crime, in order to ensure that Egypt’s increased military presence in the Sinai also enhances Israel’s security.
Egypt’s newly democratic government would be more strictly accountable for fulfilling the treaty’s terms if it played an active role in establishing them.
At the same time, the agreement would boost domestic support for Egypt’s government and enhance its regional standing.
Likewise, US involvement in the negotiations would benefit all parties.
The process would provide an opportunity for the Egyptian military to engage with the US, helping to bolster its case for aid in a difficult environment.
Moreover, the US could set clear, narrow terms for the talks and provide a guarantee that the outcome would not impinge on Israel’s core interests, thereby mitigating Israeli officials’ fears that opening the treaty’s military annex for revision would call into question its other terms.
Finally, playing a successful role in bolstering Israel-Egypt relations could advance US Secretary of State John Kerry’s diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East.
In a region as volatile as the Middle East, no country can afford to take peace for granted.
But, by renewing their bilateral treaty now, Egypt and Israel would maximize their chances of prolonging an arrangement that has kept them from fighting for more than three decades.
How to Resolve the Euro Crisis
NEW YORK – A comprehensive solution of the euro crisis must have three major components: reform and recapitalization of the banking system, a eurobond regime, and an exit mechanism.
First, the banking system.
The European Union’s Maastricht Treaty was designed to deal only with imbalances in the public sector; but, as it happened, the excesses in the banking sector were far worse.
The euro’s introduction led to housing booms in countries like Spain and Ireland.
Eurozone banks became among the world’s most over-leveraged – and the worst-affected by the crash of 2008.
They remain badly in need of protection from the threat of insolvency.
The first step was taken recently when the European Financial Stability Facility was authorized to rescue banks as well as governments.
This needs to be followed by other steps.
The equity capital of banks urgently needs to be substantially increased.
And if a European agency is to guarantee banks’ solvency, that agency must also oversee them.
A European banking agency would break up the incestuous relationship between banks and regulators that was at the root of the excesses that fueled the current crisis.
And it would interfere much less with national sovereignty than would the subordination of fiscal policies to an EU or eurozone-wide authority.
Second, Europe needs eurobonds.
The introduction of the euro was supposed to reinforce convergence; in fact, it created divergences, with widely different levels of indebtedness and competitiveness separating the member countries.
If heavily indebted countries have to pay heavy risk premiums, their debt becomes unsustainable.
And that is now happening.
The solution is obvious: deficit countries must be allowed to refinance the bulk of their debt on the same terms as surplus countries.
This is best accomplished by authorizing the issuance of eurobonds, which would be jointly guaranteed by all of the member countries.
While the principle is clear, the details will require a lot of work.
Which supranational agency will be in charge of issuing eurobonds?
What rules will it follow in authorizing issuance?
How will it enforce the rules?
Presumably, the eurobonds would be under the control of the eurozone finance ministers.
The board would constitute the fiscal counterpart of the European Central Bank; it would also be the European counterpart of the International Monetary Fund.
The debate will therefore revolve around voting rights.
The ECB operates on the principle of one vote per country; the IMF assigns voting rights according to countries’ capital contributions.
Which system should prevail?
The former could give carte blanche to debtor countries to run up their deficits; the latter might perpetuate a two-speed Europe.
Some compromise will be necessary.
Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany, and because the issuance of eurobonds will put Germany’s own credit standing at risk, the compromise will clearly have to put Germany in the driver’s seat.
Unfortunately, Germany has some unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy: it wants the rest of Europe to follow its example.
But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe: no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits.
Germany must propose rules that other countries can follow.
These rules must allow for a gradual reduction in indebtedness. They must also allow countries with high unemployment, like Spain, to continue running&nbsp; budget deficits.
Rules involving targets for cyclically adjusted deficits can accomplish both of these goals.
Most importantly, the rules must recognize their own imperfection – and thus must remain open to review and improvement.
Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank, has proposed that eurobonds should constitute 60% of eurozone members’ outstanding external debt.
Given the high risk premiums currently prevailing in Europe, this percentage is too low to constitute a level playing field.
In my view, new issues should be entirely in eurobonds up to a limit set by the Board.
The higher the volume of eurobonds a country seeks to issue, the more severe the conditions the Board would impose.
The Board should have no problem imposing its will, because denying the right to issue additional eurobonds would be a powerful deterrent.
Surveillance must be improved, however, in order to give countries timely notice when they are in violation.
This leads directly to the third unsolved problem: What happens if a country is unwilling or unable to keep within agreed conditions?
Inability to issue eurobonds could result in a disorderly default or devaluation.
In the absence of an exit mechanism, this would have catastrophic consequences.
A deterrent that is too dangerous to invoke would lack credibility. Greece constitutes a cautionary example.
This is the most difficult of the three problem areas, and I do not claim to have a ready solution.
Much depends on how the Greek crisis plays out.
It might be possible to devise an orderly exit for a small country like Greece that could not be applied to a large one like Italy.
In that case, the eurobond regime would have to carry sanctions from which there is no escape – something like a European finance ministry that has political as well as financial legitimacy which could emerge from the intense debate and soul-searching that is so badly needed (particularly in Germany).
One thing is certain: these three problem areas – reform and recapitalization of the banking system, a eurobond regime, and an exit mechanism – need to be resolved to make the euro a viable currency.
But financial markets might not offer the respite necessary to put the new arrangements in place.
Under continued market pressure, the European Council might have to find a stopgap arrangement to avoid a calamity.
It could authorize the ECB to lend directly to governments that cannot borrow from the markets on reasonable terms until a eurobond regime is introduced.
How to Save Brazil
SÃO PAULO – Brazil’s political crisis appears to be coming to a head.
Now that the lower house of the National Congress has voted in favor of President Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment for violating fiscal rules, the Senate’s 81 members will vote in the coming days on whether to try her.
If 42 agree, she will be suspended for up to 180 days, during which time Vice President Michel Temer will assume the presidency.
If the Senate does not produce a two-thirds vote for conviction during that period, Rousseff will return to the presidency.
But the most likely outcome, it seems, will be for Temer to carry out the final two years of Rousseff’s term.
Whatever happens next, Brazil is not out of the woods.
Its economic situation is dire – a direct result of populist policies initiated by Rousseff’s predecessor, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and which she maintained.
In the early 2000s, flush with cash thanks to a commodity boom, Lula’s government began to distribute subsidized credit to consumers and businesses, hold down energy prices artificially, and expand government spending at more than double the rate of GDP growth.
The result was mounting public debt, which has now reached 70% of GDP, and a widening deficit, which has now reached nearly 11% of GDP.
Rather than acknowledge the problem and revise policies accordingly, Rousseff allegedly resorted to dodgy accounting tricks to enable her government ostensibly to meet its primary-surplus target without cutting social transfers, even as commodity prices collapsed.
This enabled her to win reelection in 2014 – and it is propelling her toward impeachment today.
(The massive corruption scandal engulfing Petrobras, the state-owned oil company, which Rousseff used to head, has not helped her case.)
But Rousseff is of course far from the only one suffering the consequences of this approach.
Brazil is now facing its worst economic recession in 80 years; unemployment stands at almost 10%; annual inflation exceeds 10%; and living standards have collapsed.
Though Brazilians pay 37% of GDP in taxes each year – about the same rate as Europeans – the quality of their public services remains very low.
Assuming he takes over as President, Temer will have to act fast to put the economy back on track, rebuild business confidence, and restore the people’s trust in government.
It would be a daunting task for any leader, but it is especially so for one who will spend only two years in power and does not enjoy widespread popular support.
For Temer, there is no room for mistakes.
His first mission will be to form a cabinet that can produce rigorous and credible economic policies and secure the needed congressional support.
A four-point agenda for economic revitalization should then be implemented.
The first point of that agenda should be to fast-track infrastructure investment.
This is the fastest way to revive the economy and generate employment.
But Brazil desperately needs foreign capital to finance construction of roads, ports, and airports, as well as energy projects.
To attract it, the government must improve transparency, simplify rules and regulations, introduce performance bonds (to guarantee the completion of projects), and abolish the cap on return on investment.
The second item on the agenda should be labor-market reform.
The best approach, which would enable the government to avoid an endless political debate about which labor laws should be revoked, would be to approve a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right of workers to conclude private contracts with employers.
Such a measure would reduce labor costs significantly and bring workers out of the informal sector.
Third, Temer must tackle pension reform.
Though there is a consensus that the retirement age should be raised from 60 to 65, there is strong resistance to cutting benefits.
Again, the government can minimize time-wasting political entanglements – this time, by focusing on the public sector.
Brazil’s government currently spends roughly the same amount on 950,000 retired public servants that it spends on 28 million retired private-sector workers, meaning that the bigger problem is also the one that will be less politically difficult to address.
Finally, Brazil needs to reinsert itself into the global economy.
To that end, it must revive productivity growth, expand exports, open its economy to international competition, and forge new bilateral and regional trade deals with major economic players.
If Temer’s government succeeds in the first three areas, building up its credibility in the process, it will be in a strong position to fulfill these objectives, as well.
This four-point agenda is crucial to restoring Brazil’s economy and bringing public spending under control.
But it will not be enough to stop the vicious boom-and-bust cycles to which Brazil has long been vulnerable.
For that, Brazilians must take a hard look at the attitudes and expectations that have placed them in this situation.
Real change means breaking the addiction to a paternalistic and interventionist state and supporting needed policy adjustments, even when they are unpleasant.
Brazilians still have a long way to go to eliminate corruption, reform or rescind populist policies, and create efficient and responsible state institutions.
But the combination of popular indignation, courageous and independent judges, and a dynamic free press seems to be propelling the country along a promising path, as the irresponsible actions of politicians and businessmen are not only brought to light, but also punished.
By itself, Rousseff’s likely impeachment will solve nothing.
But if it helps to bury beliefs and values that have been holding Brazil back, the country, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, may find itself at the end of the beginning.
How to Sell Anti-Protectionism
STOCKHOLM – The looming global recession has brought government intervention to save failing companies to the forefront of economic policy.
In a speech just prior to the recent G-20 summit, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned President-elect Barack Obama against bailing out America’s struggling Big Three automakers, arguing that global competition has made their decline irreversible.
A bailout, then, would simply delay the inevitable at a huge cost to taxpayers.
Such advice is always tough to sell – all the more so in the face of the worst economic outlook in 70 years.
After all, according to conventional wisdom, global competition moves jobs to low-cost countries and puts downward pressure on wages everywhere else.
As globalization intensifies and accelerates economic change, it affects the lives of ordinary citizens like never before, stoking popular fear.
Little wonder, then, that French president Nicolas Sarkozy succumbed to the allure of protectionism during last year’s election campaign, as did both presidential candidates in the United States.
But protectionism need not be the only alternative to fear of global competition.
In the Scandinavian countries, as in the US, foreign competition intensified sharply during the past decade.
China and India gained considerable economic power, and close neighbors in previously isolated communist states were rapidly integrated in the European economy.
However, surveys by Pew Research show that in Sweden, 85% of the population agrees that trade is good for their country, compared to only 59% of Americans.
Among Swedish industrial workers, the figure is 75% in favor.
How can that be?
By designing educational and social protection policies that strengthen the individual, Scandinavian politicians have sought to promote change rather than prevent it.
The positive public opinion in Sweden is not a symptom of brainwashing, but a rational response to people’s experience during the last decade.
As competition intensified and production started moving to the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, Sweden’s policy answer was to upgrade the skills of the work force.
As a result, from 1997 to 2007, Swedish exports nearly doubled and industrial production grew by 36%, with manufacturing companies achieving record-high productivity growth.
Indeed, while annual US output per hour grew by 6.2% during this period, Swedish productivity rose by 8%.
Sweden accumulated a current-account surplus of 53% of GDP, in contrast to America’s 48%-of-GDP deficit.
Employment rose by 11%, and blue-collar workers’ wages increased by 24%, fueling a more than 30% surge in private consumption.
In short, even as globalization progressed, Swedish wage earners enjoyed a substantial improvement in living standards.
While some jobs moved abroad, the net effect was still greatly positive.
The secret behind Sweden’s successful development, and hence people’s attitudes, is how the costs of change are distributed.
Official policy aims to reduce the cost of globalization for individuals, but never for companies.
Entrepreneurs need to face competition in order to develop, whereas individuals who are laid off may have difficulties getting back into productive work.
As trade minister of Sweden for most of this period, I never hindered or postponed import competition.
In the European Union, Sweden voted against almost all anti-dumping and other protectionist proposals.
This never met any criticism from my voters, because educational policy and the social safety net were designed to lower workers’ risk aversion.
Broad educational policies equip an increasing share of Sweden’s population with basic education, thereby enhancing their employability.
Higher education is free of charge and accessible in all parts of the country.
But reaching one cohort per year is too little to meet demands in a fast-changing economy.
Therefore, on top of this, large resources are spent on modernizing the skills of those already in the labor force.
Social protection also has a broad, general nature.
In the Scandinavian countries, as opposed to, say, Germany and the US, the government, not individual companies, are responsible for most social benefits.
That way, economically irrational lock-in effects, whereby workers simply cannot afford to change jobs, are avoided.
Furthermore, benefits are generous enough to ensure that short periods of unemployment don’t force workers to sell their homes or even cars.
The system protects not only the unemployed, who can continue to pay their mortgages and interest, but also indirectly the banks, because their loans to households are repaid even in times of recession.
And, instead of solving all sorts of economically caused private problems, laid-off workers can concentrate on finding new and more future-oriented jobs.
No doubt, these policies are expensive. But they pay for themselves by producing growth and revenues.
As the past decade shows, they have served the Scandinavian countries well during a period of extreme internationalization.
Instead of giving in to conventional wisdom, we have exploited the possibilities that globalization and technological change offer.
Could the Scandinavian model work for others?
At the very least, the Scandinavian example shows that politicians have more than one option to choose from when considering how to handle globalization.
Intense foreign competition and rapid technological change does not have to be a race to the bottom.
On the contrary, it can be compatible with rapidly rising real income and more and better jobs.
How to Sell Global Re-Balancing
CHICAGO – At its most recent meeting in Toronto this spring, the G-20 agreed to disagree.
Even though the world economy is desperately in need of rebalancing, their declaration was deliberately vague enough to accommodate any set of domestic policies that countries might choose.
Everyone came away thinking that they had won, but the world largely lost.
World trade is highly imbalanced.
Households in the United States, having spent too much, are now weighed down by debt.
Exporters in Europe and Asia have become excessively dependent on selling to the US and other, now-weakened, economies like Spain and the United Kingdom.
Myopic actions on both sides have helped entrench a longer-term pattern of behavior that only makes it harder to move away from today’s unsustainable equilibrium.
As ever, change upsets the cozy status quo and the interests that benefit from it.
For example, the real-estate lobby in the US obviously has no desire to see government support for housing diminish, despite the fact that the US probably has far more housing stock than it can afford.
Similarly, the export lobby in China has no interest in a strong renminbi, even though it is in China’s long-term interest to let its currency appreciate.
We keep hoping that somehow meetings of heads of state will magically produce the policies that will rebalance world trade.
Unfortunately, the macroeconomic changes that countries must make involve actions to which even heads of state are unable to commit.
No US president can unilaterally agree to alter the pattern of government support and spending; that is a decision for Congress.
Similarly, no Chinese president can unilaterally agree to allow the renminbi to appreciate faster; that is a consensus decision reached together with the various apparatchiks in the State Council and Communist Party.
Moreover, the necessary reforms in both America and China go well beyond these two steps. They require deep, fundamental changes.
So we are caught between a financially unsustainable pattern of global demand and the need for politically difficult changes in many countries’ domestic policies.
All politics is local, and there is no local constituency for the global economy, so what triumphs often erodes global imbalances further.
The G-20 asked the International Monetary Fund to prepare a road map for the policies that countries will have to follow to restore stable global growth.
But neither the G-20 nor the IMF can impose its will on national governments – nor should they.
How, then, can we go beyond ritualistic meetings that do little to advance the global agenda?
Obviously, we need more political support for that agenda.
Perhaps non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like Oxfam or Mothers against Land Mines suggest a way.
These movements use pressure from below to convince political leaders that there is domestic support for international agreement.
The ability of grassroots movements to influence policy is set to increase.
As the power of the Internet spreads through social and political networking sites, and as virtual democracy grows, this bottom-up influence is likely to grow.
Those who want to influence political leaders must get used to convincing their masters, the people, directly.
Unfortunately, it is difficult for existing NGOs to take up the cause of popularizing global economic policy coordination.
Unlike hunger or land mines, the cause of rectifying global trade imbalances will not touch the public enough to attract the donations that are necessary to keep NGOs afloat.
But there is an organization that could do the job: the IMF. If the IMF reoriented a substantial portion of its activities towards influencing the influential among the world’s public, it could have far more impact on global macroeconomic policy, especially policies followed by countries that do not need its loans, than it does today.
The IMF is currently under-equipped for this task.
If it is to improve its persuasive capabilities, it must learn to become more like grassroots activists, with punchy prose, clear policy recommendations, and TV-ready talking points.
It must go directly to the public – including political parties, nongovernmental organizations, and influential figures – in each country, and explain its position.
The Fund must also do more to enhance its presence on the Web and in school and university classrooms, especially as students are often the most receptive to ideas about global citizenship.
Above all, the Fund must change how it is perceived from outside.
It must be seen as an institution that respects each country’s sovereignty but works for the global good.
A transparent and fair process of arriving at its policy recommendations, based primarily on convincing economic research and data analysis, will be essential.
Countries will have to agree to accept and facilitate the IMF’s direct engagement with their influential citizenry as long as it is carried out in good faith.
The IMF’s expression of its economic views to local publics should then be protected by international agreement, much like embassies and their activities.  
If we can make these changes – and one should not minimize the scale of the task – perhaps when G-20 leaders meet in the future, they will not think that their citizens have little interest in the outcome. Instead, they will have a political mandate to attend meaningfully to the welfare of the global economy.
How to Waste a Crisis
The global financial crisis is reaching a bottom, and yet political frustration is growing, because the low point of the collapse seems to offer a last opportunity to promote dramatic change, and that opportunity may be missed.
Last year, President Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel remarked that a good crisis should never be wasted.
Disaster is an opportunity for thinking of ways to make the world fundamentally better – and also prevent future crises.
People do a great deal of thinking, but sometimes they think so much that they come up with contradictory responses.
Indeed, what really makes a crisis profound is precisely the broad variety of differing diagnoses and different remedies.
The political passions aroused by the clashes of interpretation often make the crisis seemingly insoluble.
It was those conflicts, rather than some technical flaw in the operation of the economy, which made the Great Depression of the 1930’s such a dismal and destructive event.
Responses to a crisis fall into two categories.
The first type aims at an institutional reordering, so that inefficiencies and perverse incentives are removed, and the economy functions more smoothly and efficiently.
The second, more radical approach, tries to improve not the economy but the way people themselves go about their lives.
No institutional solution is purely neutral in its effects on relative incomes – and it is relative income and wealth around which political debate typically revolves.
Bailout operations invariably bring bitter controversy because they help some but not others.
Rescuing automobile producers looks good to their employees and suppliers. But the costs must be borne by everyone, including firms that are not rescued – probably because they operate more efficiently – and are put at a competitive disadvantage as a result.
Such rescues, in short, appear to help big companies with bad managers.
Small businesses will always complain that they do not have the organizational clout to extract public funds from governments.
And bank bailouts, involving the direct use of public money to recapitalize failing institutions, are even more costly and politically unpopular.
Advocates of monetary stimulation sometimes argue that it is preferable because it is more neutral in its distributional effects, and that its benefits are spread more widely.
But monetary stimulus is often in reality just as selective as bailouts.
The analogy popularized by the great monetarist economist Milton Friedman was that the central bank could always deal with deflationary problems by dropping money from a helicopter.
But, in the real world, not everyone is underneath the helicopter when it makes the drop.
In fact, it is likely that the helicopter pilot will hover over friends and relatives when dropping the money.
And even if the pilot is completely non-corrupt, the crowd on the ground will always assume that there is some hidden and partisan plan.
That has been precisely the problem with the aggressive provision of liquidity, quantitative easing, and the reduction of central bank interest rates used to address the current crisis.
In today’s credit crunch, as in the Great Depression, central banks lend at practically zero interest rates.
Depositors are paid almost nothing on their deposits. But when businesses and consumers try to borrow, they find that it is very costly, if not impossible.
Lenders (the bankers) are suspicious, worried about creditworthiness, and demand high risk premia.
As a consequence, in most countries, credit is still contracting.
In practice, it is only banks that have access to cheap borrowing, so they can reconstitute their balance sheets by borrowing cheaply and lending expensively.
This is why banks suddenly look so unexpectedly profitable.
But the contrast between bank profitability and the woes of everyone else turns up the political heat on the central banks, which have to explain why it is only their “friends,” the banks, who are standing under the helicopter when it drops money.
Frustration with the complexities of trying to provide ready fixes leads to attempts to find even more radical solutions.
Some try to deal with basic human proclivities, and to modify behavior to make people better.
It is in times of crisis that Utopian ideas about ways of guaranteeing human happiness flourish, often claiming some scientific basis.
For example, long before the financial collapse, experimental economists joined psychologists in attempting to measure varying propensities to greediness.
Some evidence suggests that there is a link between the level of dopamine, addiction, and greedy behavior.
Since a common diagnosis of the problems generated in the financial services business holds that human greed is to blame, a German think tank recently suggested that people with a genetic proclivity to high dopamine levels should be barred from taking leading positions in financial institutions.
But such apparently attractive strategies aimed at making better people turn out to be exclusionary – and based on rather arbitrary testing.
If implemented, the German proposal would most likely exclude behavior that involves acceptable risk, as well as sidelining those who take wild and inappropriate decisions.
Both the institutional and the behavioral responses to a crisis are fundamentally problematical.  The search for technical solutions leads to political polarization, and may produce stalemate.
The search for deep human roots of the crisis, by contrast, leads to attempts to change human nature, which are futile – and also inherently much more dangerous.
How Trump Would Weaken America
CAMBRIDGE – Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive US presidential nominee, has expressed deep skepticism about the value of America’s alliances.
His is a very nineteenth-century view of the world.
Back then, the United States followed George Washington’s advice to avoid “entangling alliances” and pursued the Monroe Doctrine, which focused on US interests in the Western Hemisphere.
Lacking a large standing army (and with a navy that in the 1870s was smaller than Chile’s), the US played a minor role in the nineteenth-century global balance of power.
That changed decisively with America’s entry into World War I, when Woodrow Wilson broke with tradition and sent US troops to fight in Europe.
Moreover, he proposed a League of Nations to organize collective security on a global basis.
But, after the Senate rejected US membership in the League in 1919, the troops stayed home and America “returned to normal.”
Though it was now a major global actor, the US became virulently isolationist.
Its absence of alliances in the 1930s set the stage for a disastrous decade marked by economic depression, genocide, and another world war.
Ominously, Trump’s most detailed speech on foreign policy suggests that he takes his inspiration from precisely this period of isolation and “America First” sentiment.
Such sentiment has always been a current in US politics, but it has remained out of the mainstream since the end of World War II for good reason: It hinders, rather than advances, peace and prosperity at home and abroad.
The turn away from isolation and the beginning of the “American century” in world politics was marked by President Harry Truman’s decisions after WWII, which led to permanent alliances and a military presence abroad.
The US invested heavily in the Marshall Plan in 1948, created NATO in 1949, and led a United Nations coalition that fought in Korea in 1950.
In 1960, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a security treaty with Japan.
American troops remain in Europe, Japan, and Korea to this day.
While the US has had bitter partisan differences over disastrous interventions in developing countries such as Vietnam and Iraq, there is a bedrock of consensus on its alliance system – and not just among those who make and think about foreign policy.
Opinion polls show popular majorities in support of NATO and the US-Japan alliance.
Nonetheless, for the first time in 70 years, a major US presidential candidate is calling this consensus into question.
Alliances not only reinforce US power; they also maintain geopolitical stability – for example, by slowing the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons.
While US presidents and defense secretaries have sometimes complained about its allies’ low levels of defense spending, they have always understood that alliances are best viewed as stabilizing commitments – like friendships, not real-estate transactions.
Unlike the constantly shifting alliances of convenience that characterized the nineteenth century, modern American alliances have sustained a relatively predictable international order.
In some cases, such as Japan, host-country support even makes it cheaper to station troops overseas than in the US.
And yet Trump extols the virtues of unpredictability – a potentially useful tactic when bargaining with enemies, but a disastrous approach to reassuring friends.
Americans often complain about free riders, without recognizing that the US has been the one steering the bus.
It is not impossible that a new challenger – say, Europe, Russia, India, Brazil, or China – surpasses the US in the coming decades and takes the wheel.
But it is not likely, either.
Among the features that distinguish the US from “the dominant great powers of the past,” according to the distinguished British strategist Lawrence Freedman, is that “American power is based on alliances rather than colonies.”
Alliances are assets; colonies are liabilities.
A narrative of American decline is likely to be inaccurate and misleading.
More important, it holds dangerous policy implications if it encourages countries like Russia to engage in adventurous policies, China to be more assertive with its neighbors, or the US to overreact out of fear.
America has many problems, but it is not in absolute decline, and it is likely to remain more powerful than any single state for the foreseeable future.
The real problem for the US is not that it will be overtaken by China or another contender, but that a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors – will pose new obstacles to global governance.
The real challenge will be entropy – the inability to get work done.
Weakening America’s alliances, the likely result of Trump’s policies, is hardly the way to “make America great again.”
America will face an increasing number of new transnational issues that require it to exercise power with others as much as over others.
And, in a world of growing complexity, the most connected states are the most powerful.
As Anne-Marie Slaughter has put it, “diplomacy is social capital; it depends on the density and reach of a nation’s diplomatic contacts.”
The US, according to Australia’s Lowy Institute, tops the ranking of countries by number of embassies, consulates, and missions.
The US has some 60 treaty allies; China has few.
The Economist magazine estimates that of the world’s 150 largest countries, nearly 100 lean toward the US, while 21 lean against it.
Contrary to claims that the “Chinese century” is at hand, we have not entered a post-American world.
The US remains central to the workings of the global balance of power, and to the provision of global public goods.
But American preeminence in military, economic, and soft-power terms will not look like it once did.
The US share of the world economy will fall, and its ability to wield influence and organize action will become increasingly constrained.
More than ever, America’s ability to sustain the credibility of its alliances as well as establish new networks will be central to its global success.
Kenya’s Unity Test
NAIROBI – Kenya’s fiercely contested presidential election in March, and its disputed outcome, has left the victor, Uhuru Kenyatta, with a daunting challenge: to unite a country riven with ethnic violence and distrust.
Although this election was accompanied by far less violence than the previous presidential vote in 2007, the opposition candidate Raila Odinga’s second consecutive defeat has only re-enforced his supporters’ fears that they are once again being cheated out of power.
Kenyatta, a member of the dominant Kikuyu ethnic group, says that he wants to heal the country’s divisions, echoing the promise of his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki.
There is a simple way to start: combat the corruption and nepotism that characterize so much state employment.
Kenyatta assumes power a half-century after his father, Jomo Kenyatta, led Kenya to independence.
The anniversary provides a reason to reflect on some of the country’s achievements and failings, especially in the field of education –&#160;the key to economic opportunity and professionalization of the public sector.
During the colonial era, most of Kenya’s children were denied schooling.
The post-independence government thus found itself having to hire vast numbers of teachers, many of them unqualified, to cope with the influx of black students attending school for the first time.
Today, however, there is an oversupply of trained teachers.
In fact, many of them can now only find work in neighboring countries such as South Sudan, which needs to fill shortages left by decades of conflict.
Investment in Kenya’s education system, along with economic reforms, and (until recently) relative political stability has undoubtedly helped the economy, which has grown by around 4-5% annually over the past decade, following long periods of stagnation.
By some definitions, around one-quarter of the country’s 44 million people are in the middle class.
Compared with the rest of the region, the country’s key sectors – including education, transport, communications, agriculture, and tourism – are professionally managed and the envy of much of East Africa.
But the emergence of an increasingly educated population has also intensified the need for more skilled jobs.
Unemployment is conservatively estimated at a staggering 40% of the workforce.
The government has promised to create jobs, but that is only part of the battle; it must also reform the way such jobs are filled.
Public-sector employment in Kenya is notoriously opaque.
Kenyans typically complain that key positions are not advertised nationally (as required by law) until the employer has already found the “ideal” candidate.
Instead, vacancies are listed internally as temporary contracts, obviating the need for a national search.
This makes it easy for a manager to hire a relative or friend, usually from a favored ethnic group.
The candidate is then best placed to benefit when the temporary post is upgraded and advertised as a permanent position.
There are even instances in which two managers will contrive to hire each other’s relatives to evade nepotism charges.
The system is hardest on first-generation graduates who lack a highly placed relative to help them into the workforce; they are often left with no option but to pay a hefty bribe to advance their careers.
Unsurprisingly, the way state jobs are filled, from the presidency down, has become a source of deep and widespread bitterness.
The Kenyatta government could go a long way toward addressing the problem with one very practical measure: establishing and supporting an independent watchdog to audit hiring and promotion decisions in official agencies.
The vetting process that Kenyans observed being applied to recent cabinet appointments should be extended throughout the public sector (and also to private entities that win state contracts).
An independent watchdog would require all employers to demonstrate that their hiring practices are transparent, competitive, and meritocratic.
Such an agency need not be expensive.
Its very existence, and the threat of random investigations, would serve as an effective deterrent against malpractice – just as random audits deter tax evaders.
Whistleblowers, encouraged to come forward by legal protections enshrined in the agency’s founding legislation, would provide leads for the investigators.
Kenyatta has a chance to steer Kenya away from the ethnic tensions that have plagued its society and economy.
By introducing and implementing fairness and transparency to public-sector recruitment, and ensuring that appointments are based on talent, not ethnic or family connections, Kenyans may become less fearful about their political leaders’ origins.
They may also grow more confident that their skills will be properly deployed in a fast-growing economy, further spreading the prosperity that many fellow citizens have only recently started to enjoy.
How United Is \
Seen from the point of view of the European Union's longtime member states, the eight postcommunist countries that - together with Cyprus and Malta - joined the EU on May 1st seem united in their positions on most important issues.
Indeed, since the US intervention in Iraq, many West Europeans see the EU's new members from Europe's East as something of a bloc.
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's division of Europe into "new" and "old" was, above all, a clever ploy that helped the Bush Administration get its way by using the old strategy of "divide and rule."
But, although it reflected real differences between established EU members and the newcomers, it also managed to solidify the false impression that the EU's new members share a similar identity and political agenda.
Rumsfeld's remarks were divisive because Western Europe seems to know even less than the Americans about Europe's eastern half.
In reality, big differences exist among the new EU members.
Even with regard to Iraq, there was little unity.
While some countries ­- say, Poland - strongly supported America's war effort, others tried to balance their support for the US with their "understanding" of the views of Germany and France.
Still others - for example, Slovenia - stood on the side of "old Europe."
Beyond politics, there are vast differences among the economies of the new members, not only in terms of wealth, but also in their structures.
Industrialized and urbanized countries, with relatively small agricultural sectors, such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia, or Slovakia, have different concerns than Poland, where farmers form 20% of the population.
Historical traditions also play a role.
Although all new member states claim to be "western," some are more Western than others.
The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and parts of Poland share a common legacy of Mitteleuropa , formed during the Hapsburg Empire.
Moreover, communism in those states was different than that practiced in the three Baltic countries, which were part of the Soviet Union.
At the start of the 1990's, following communism's fall, the common experiences and the shared legacy of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland were behind the idea of creating the so-called "Visegrad Group," with the aim of coordinating the three countries' efforts to join the EU and NATO.
The Visegrad initiative worked to some extent, though it was temporarily paralyzed by the disintegration of Czechoslovakia just over a decade ago.
Although the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia recently declared they wanted to keep the Visegrad grouping alive even after their countries' enter the EU, the future of Visegrad cooperation is uncertain.
In fact, the fate of this group is perhaps the best example of how individual identities of the new member states are beginning to assert themselves now that membership in the EU and NATO are secured.
Poland, as its stance over the EU constitution demonstrated, pursues its own specific interests in a united Europe, which may be difficult to harmonize with the interests of smaller Central European states.
Once in the Union, Poland will have an even freer hand, unconstrained by the need to support the aspirations of other East European countries.
Some advocates of a closer Visegrad cooperation criticize Poland's emerging strategy, while euroskeptics in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia applaud the Poles.
For example, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, heavily influenced by Czech President Vaclav Klaus, describes Poland as the Czech Republic's chief ally and an example of how new members should approach the EU.
The situation could become even more complicated, because some leaders in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia would like to join the "hard core" of European integration should some European states one day decide to create a two-speed Europe.
If these countries join the hard core of European integration, while others, Poland in particular, opt to stay out, it would create a dividing line between them, burying Visegrad cooperation.
Regardless of what happens, all Europe needs to get past clichés about "old" versus "new" Europe.
Poland may find that it has security and other interests in common with some states of a similar size in the current EU.
The three Baltic states will most likely cooperate much more closely with the Scandinavian countries than with the other new members.
It is also time to start thinking about a new way of organizing Central Europe.
For the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, close cooperation with Poland may not be the best way to protect their interests in the EU, as their interests and the interests of a big, self-confident Poland may not be identical.
It may be more natural for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia to strive for closer regional cooperation with Austria and Slovenia, the contours of which can already be seen in some existing regional groupings.
Such a regional group would be bound together by a long common history and compatible interests.
This would be much more effective and durable than the Visegrad initiative, which lumps together three small states with a country that has more inhabitants than its three partners put together, plus its own agenda.
How Will Tomorrow’s Scientists Learn?
I was recently invited to speak at science-related meetings on two consecutive days in different places in Europe.
One was the official opening of a network of science centers in Vienna, linking decentralized activities in an interactive exhibition that tour Austria.
The other was the Science Festival of Genoa, Italy, a young and hugely successful event with exhibitions and high-profile speakers throughout the ancient town.
What struck me on both occasions was the sustained, and evidently successful, attempt to reach out to the two target groups upon whom the future of science and technology will depend.
The first group is teenagers, who are deeply interested in all the new technologies and gadgets that surround them.
They have made these technologies an integral part of their lives, but their relationship to science has remained distant.
The other target audience consists of younger children, whose openness and inborn curiosity have not yet been stifled by formal schooling.
The success of Europe’s newly established science centers and festivals in reaching their potential audiences reflects their invention of a new way of teaching and learning.
They have succeeded in setting up a largely informal learning environment, focusing mainly on truly interactive learning.
By soliciting questions from children that have little place in the formal educational system, the audience is led to experience the research process – which often begins precisely by asking the right kind of question.
Although we will need more such informal learning environments in the future, politicians and the public have hardly noticed.
Gone are the utopian dreams of the 1970’s, when there were visions of life-long learning and paid leaves of absence to pursue topics that might be useful for further professional advancement – or might also include the sheer luxury of studying ancient Greek or Assyrian art.
But the need for some kind of continuous learning has become even more obvious today, in a world driven by the forces of globalization.
The relentless competition for talent and skills is being underscored daily by the increases in R&amp;D investment in China and India, whose growing middle classes are only too keen to seek better educational opportunities for their children.
Talent is now recognized as a scarce commodity that needs to be nurtured for a worldwide market of skills and competencies.
“The battle for brainpower,” as  The Economist recently put it, has begun.
It is fairly safe to predict that learning in a knowledge-intensive society will continue at a heightened pace, both at the workplace and outside of it. It will be facilitated through Web-based social software, through wikis, blogs, and similar developments as much as through new, “open source” business models.
These are informal structures, even if they have owners and access to them is regulated.
The corporate world – indeed, the formal workplace more generally – can no longer be strictly separated from the informal world in which work and leisure have become blurred.
Just as formal schooling needs to become better integrated with the informal learning environments to which our children are exposed in multiple ways, formal and informal learning must mesh in a life-long process.
Science and technology have an enormous stake in this development, and worldwide competition for the best brains is already acutely felt in European universities.
This year’s Nobel Prizes highlighted once more that the research climate in the United States continues to be more conducive to scientific excellence compared to what Europe has to offer.
Initiatives aimed at fostering scientific excellence in Europe, like one recently launched in Germany that officially defined three universities, all in the southern part of the country, as “excellent”(qualifying them for extra funding), seek to make universities more attractive and thus more competitive.
While such efforts certainly point in the right direction, the research-friendliness and innovativeness of the wider societal environment – particularly practices of informal learning and opportunities to follow one’s curiosity – also matter.
When, beginning in the nineteenth century, book publishing became not only a lucrative business, but also made books increasingly affordable to many more households, the sources of learning in society exploded.
Indeed, the societal wealth created through the Industrial Revolution is partly due to this new diffusion of knowledge and skills.
Seeing the excitement that can be generated in young people through events like science festivals and networks of science centers gives rise to cautious optimism – provided we seize the diversity of opportunities that informal learning offers.
Informal learning implies a messy, unruly, and potentially subversive process.
But it also promises to nurture the creative ferment in which great science thrives.
How Women Go Bankrupt
As the world struggles to emerge from the economic near-collapse of last fall, there is one sub-group that has slid below the waterline in record numbers: formerly middle-class women.
A new report shows that a million American middle-class women will find themselves in bankruptcy court this year.
This is more women than will “graduate from college, receive a diagnosis of cancer, or file for divorce,” according to the economist Elizabeth Warren .
Their plight, symptomatic in many ways of the plight of women around the world, holds lessons for us all.
These bankrupt women are better educated than their male counterparts: most have some college; and more than half own their own homes.
What tipped them from middle-class lifestyles to incomes just above the poverty line were likely to have been one or all of three factors.
Two are economic, and, for many women, the third may be emotional.
First, these women tend to be awash in debt.
Just about everyone spent above their means in the recent bubble, but middle-class women have a special relationship to debt.
Many of them have jobs that require them to dip into credit lines just to stay afloat.
But others have been successfully targeted by luxury-goods manufacturers and credit-card companies, which benefit from the way that mass culture ties certain kinds of consumerism – the latest designer clothes, this season’s “it” bag, the right highlighting, and even the trendiest sports car – into a narrative of successful femininity.
Nor is this pressure confined to the United States.
New middle classes are emerging globally, and magazines like Cosmopolitan and Vogue are targeting newly middle-class women in India and China – many of them part of a generation with its own disposable income for the first time ever in their family histories – with the very same luxury goods.
The second reason that a million US women have filed for bankruptcy is that legislation enacted in 2005 now pits individual women – who can’t afford costly legal advice – against credit-card companies in terms of who gets paid first when ex-husbands owe delinquent credit-card payments and child-support payments.
These pressures are serious, and both are discussed publicly.
But there is frequently a third factor in middle-class women’s economic stress, one that is seldom publicly addressed, much less measured.
It has to do with many middle-class women’s emotionally complex expectations and projections about money.
In the young women’s leadership program that I help to run at the Woodhull Institute, we regularly see that middle-class women, more often than working-class women, find it embarrassing to talk about money.
When they do bring it up – to employers, for example – they use apologetic, self-defeating language.
They are reluctant to negotiate salaries and rarely know how to do so.
They believe that asking for money in exchange for their labor makes them “unfeminine.”
They frequently assume that working twice as hard as those around them – while never speaking up for their own worth or accomplishments – will generate a raise because an authority figure will notice.
Moreover, these women tend to have unrealistic notions about their economic paths.
Young, middle-class women often fail to save because they assume – still – that marriage will rescue them financially.
As a result, they often see buying trendy shoes or a great haircut – rather than giving some money each month to a broker – as an “investment” in their romantic futures.
And the familiar cliché is all too often true: older middle-class women fail to become financially literate in their own households, leaving brokerage accounts, pension accounts, taxes, life insurance, and so on to their husbands.
This leaves them economically vulnerable when divorce or widowhood strikes.
Paradoxically, we have found that working-class women (and women of color) rarely harbor such economically problematic structures of denial.
They tend to be more ready than middle-class white women, in our experience, to master the basics of financial literacy and to learn salary negotiation, because they don’t have the luxury of assuming that a knight on a white horse will rescue them economically.
Indeed, the financial pragmatism of working-class and poor women is the reason for the successes in the developing world of micro-financing that puts money in their hands.
It would surprise me if middle-class women anywhere in the world – brought up to view certain forms of economic ignorance and naiveté as socially appropriate – could, without climbing a steep learning curve, be as reliable and hard-nosed as the world’s poor and working-class women consistently prove themselves to be.
The new book Financial Intimacy , by Jacquette Timmons, a talented financial coach who focuses on women, offers truths that would have been valuable to any of the middle-class women now in crisis.
“Many women today earn significantly more than women in previous generations,” she writes.
“But, ironically, that hasn’t necessarily resulted in a higher degree of financial security,” owing to the “don’t talk about money taboo.”
When middle-class women anywhere in the world get over this taboo, we will do so by understanding that money is never just about money, and that becoming financially literate means pushing back against a social role that casts middle-class women as polite, economically vague, underpaid, shopping-dazed dependents.
All the other awful pressures that are driving so many women into bankruptcy will still exist, but at least more women will be facing these pressures with their eyes wide open, and, one hopes, with many better options.
Japan’s Secret Demographic Weapon
NEW YORK – As the annual World Bank/International Monetary Fund meetings get underway in Tokyo, Japanese leaders must confront an unfolding demographic disaster.
Japan’s National Institute of Population and Social Security Research recently forecast that by 2060, the country will have lost nearly one-third of its 2010 population of 128 million, and just half of this smaller population will be between 15 and 65 years old – the most productive age group in any economy.
These are the kinds of numbers usually produced by wars and epidemics, and they imply both a dramatic drop in the number of young people able to provide for their elders and a much greater debt burden for a country that is already carrying one of the world’s heaviest.
To solve this problem, Japan’s political leaders have three options: find some way to raise the country’s birthrate dramatically, open a long-insular society to a wave of immigrants, or finally unveil the country’s secret weapon – the energy, talents, and ingenuity of Japanese women.
Opening the country to a surge of immigrants makes sense, but Japan is not about to become an American-style melting pot, and this solution alone would be inadequate to the scale of the demographic challenge.
Foreigners make up less than 2% of Japan’s population, and a United Nations report from 2001 found that Japan would need inflows averaging 609,000 immigrants per year until 2050 to maintain the percentage of its working-age population.
That is why Japanese policymakers should prioritize drawing more women into the workforce.
For the moment, things are moving in the wrong direction.
Japan slipped from 80th place in the World Economic Forum’s gender-gap rankings in 2006 to 98th in 2011, a worrying sign that a critical opportunity is being missed.
For women in the workplace, Japan remains the Saudi Arabia of the developed world.
The first step toward reversing this trend could be to create work environments that are better suited to the needs of Japanese women, and that promote their talents.
Government officials have taken modest steps in this direction, but culture and inertia remain powerful obstacles.
Still, the prize for getting this right is worth the effort.
A 2010 Goldman Sachs study concludes that an increase in female labor-force participation rates to parity with men would add 8.2 million workers to Japan’s economy, virtually erase the projected decline in the country’s working-age population, and boost GDP growth by 15%.
The problem is not that Japanese women lack opportunities for higher education; the university enrollment rate for 18-year-old women already exceeded that of men in 2005.
But just 65% of women with college degrees are now working.
One problem is that working for Japanese firms often requires both long hours on the job and post-work socializing with colleagues – customs that make life harder for working mothers.
But Japanese men, who spend less time caring for children than fathers in most other industrialized countries, could share more of the responsibilities of parenting.
Better work-life balance would benefit both men and women.
And increasing the availability of affordable child care would help, too.
Those who resist feminizing the workforce might argue that doing so would mean fewer children – and thus a new demographic complication.
But the evidence suggests otherwise.
OECD countries with higher female labor-force participation rates also have higher birth rates.
Japan’s birthrate has already fallen to just 1.37 children per female, far below the level that would keep the population constant.
Beyond the cultural obstacles, Japanese policymakers could take many concrete steps.
According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, 54.7% of women were employed on a non-regular basis in 2011.
Officials could encourage employers to offer women permanent, full-time positions, rather than all-too-common temporary contracts, which mean lower pay, less stability, and a lack of opportunity for advancement.
More important, current tax policies that reinforce women’s over-representation in temporary contract work should be changed.
Both the OECD and the Goldman Sachs study identify rules that discourage women from working.
A “special dependent” exemption that could be claimed by heads of households (mainly men) for dependents (mainly women) who earned less than about $12,000 per year was eliminated in 2004, but a “dependent” exemption still remains.
Policymakers could also find creative ways to increase the odds that women will return to the labor market after having children.
They could close Japan’s salary gender gap – wider than in any OECD country except South Korea – in part by establishing rules that reward performance rather than seniority.
And they could help to create credible opportunities for women to rise to leadership positions.
Opening Japan to more immigrants could help it to meet its demographic challenge. But the more durable solution is already inside the country.
The Chávez Way
LONDON – I remember the exact date of my visit to Venezuela.
I was sunbathing by the pool on the roof of the Caracas Hilton.
A waiter came up to me and mumbled something about a bomb attack in New York.
I rushed to my room and saw the news footage, endlessly replayed, of two airplanes crashing into the World Trade Center.
I was in Venezuela on September 11, 2001, to attend a conference on the “Third Way.”
Hugo Chávez was very interested in the Third Way – a modus vivendi between American-style capitalism and state socialism – as had been Tony Blair a few years earlier.
Chávez himself, dressed in fatigues, briefly graced the meeting with his presence, receiving a heavy volume of Marxist texts from an elderly professor.
A day earlier, I had had lunch at the Venezuelan central bank, sitting next to the deputy governor, Gastón Parra Luzardo.
He told me that all Venezuelans believed that they had been born with a “loaf under their arm” – that is, a right to a share in the country’s oil revenues.
As a result, no one worked hard.
An economist, Orlando Ochoa, explained that rent-seeking dominated the Venezuelan economy.
Oligarchs fight to keep control over the oil revenues, populists promise to redistribute them, and both groups steal as much as they can for themselves.
No one is interested in creating wealth.
“No one,” I wrote in my diary, “believes that Chávez will last his full term.
They see him as a damaging buffoon, rather than as a dangerous revolutionary.”
In fact, a coup against him was attempted a year later.
He survived it, and went on to win a second, a third, and then a fourth term.
The debate over Chávez’s political legacy is a posthumous re-enactment of the ideological battles that were fought while he was alive.
The battle for his economic legacy is more straightforward: it comes down to how he managed Venezuela’s oil wealth.
Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, and Chávez’s economic strategy depended on harnessing that wealth in order to address his country’s social problems.
The first few years of his rule were dominated by his struggle to gain control of the country’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA.
Upon reasserting political control in 2003, Chávez fired 40% of PDVSA’s staff.
His hostility to foreign players in the industry (he expropriated several American oil companies’ holdings in 2007) limited investment and held back production.
Chávez turned PDVSA into a personal fiefdom and used it as a cash cow; many of his social programs were funded directly from the company’s budget.
Starved of cash, PDVSA was forced to cut back on maintenance and expansion, which increased the number of accidents and limited production.
Thanks partly to Chávez’s policies, Venezuela is still a small player in the global oil market, with less than a 3% share of world production.
It is therefore vulnerable to price fluctuations, and has to follow the lead of Saudi Arabia and other big OPEC producers.
Though Venezuela’s non-oil sector has been growing, oil still provides the vast majority of its dollar earnings.
For the past decade, booming oil prices have spurred economic expansion, with only a short break following the financial crisis of 2008.
Yet stumbling oil-export performance and a sharp rise in infrastructure-related imports, combined with an explosive growth in public spending, have fueled consistently high levels of inflation, with the annual rate now at more than 20%.
This has put immense pressure on Venezuela’s dollar-pegged currency, the bolívar.
In early 2013, the government was forced to announce a 32% devaluation, and stopped issuing government debt in dollars.
The issuance of dollar bonds was a major source of abuse, with speculators buying dollar debt at the official exchange rate, selling it for greenbacks, and then exchanging them for bolivars at a much higher rate on the black market.
With limited access to global capital markets, Chávez turned to China for loans, backed by sales contracts for oil.
Loans from the China Development Bank carry higher interest rates than the West’s traditional lending mechanisms, but they also come with fewer restrictions on policy, and allowed Venezuela to escape the worst of the bondholders’ wrath – at least so far.
Where has the oil wealth gone?
Chávez’s social programs were the biggest beneficiaries.
He used to go around the villages writing checks to poor farmers.
The most reliable data suggest that he was successful at reducing inequality; during his rule, Venezuela’s Gini coefficient, a 100-point scale measuring income inequality, fell from 50 to 39, the biggest decline in Latin America.
Poverty was cut in half – from 50% to around 25% of the population, while extreme poverty fell by two-thirds.
One can hardly say that every céntimo was well spent.
Cronyism was rife and the murder rate tripled, partly owing to corruption in the police and the justice system.
Chávez’s petro-diplomacy sometimes took bizarre forms, like providing cheap bus travel for Londoners to please London’s left-wing mayor, Ken Livingstone.
Despite his extravagancies and authoritarian style, the masses loved him.
They fervently believed that he was on their side, and voted overwhelmingly for him up to the end, even when they knew that he was dying of cancer.
He is sure to enter the pantheon of Latin American heroes.
And what about the Third Way?
In the aftermath of the collapse of communism, Chávez’s mix of anti-Americanism and state activism seemed merely eccentric.
There could be no alternative to free markets and the neoliberal Washington Consensus – or so it appeared.
But the rise of China, the relative decline of the United States, the long boom in commodity prices, and the Western financial collapse of 2008 have created space for political and economic experiments.
Chávez took advantage of that opening, and Chávezism may well prove to be a significant phenomenon far beyond its Latin American homeland.
The Inflation of Hugo Chávez
MEXICO CITY – Supporters of Hugo Chávez, the recently deceased Venezuelan president, and even many of his critics, have repeatedly emphasized two supposed achievements that will burnish his legacy.
First, the share of people living in poverty plummeted to approximately 28% in 2012, from a peak of 62% in 2003 (though it was 46% three years earlier, at the beginning of Chávez’s first term).
Second, he gave to a majority of Venezuelans a sense of identity, pride, and dignity long denied them by a corrupt, elitist, light-skinned oligarchy.
Both claims, however, are only partly true, and only partly account for Chávez’s recurrent electoral victories – 13 of 14 popular votes, including referenda.
As for the first claim, both The Economist and the Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa were right to put Chávez’s achievement in perspective.
Almost every country in Latin America has reduced poverty significantly since the beginning of this century, with the extent of progress depending on baselines and cut-off dates, good years and bad years, the reliability of official data, and other factors.
The reasons for this progress are well known: with the exception of 2001 and 2009, these were boom years for commodity-exporting countries like Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Chile, and, of course, Venezuela, as well as for manufacturing-based economies, like Mexico.
Furthermore, during these nearly 15 years, most governments have managed their accounts responsibly: small or no fiscal deficits, low inflation, well-targeted anti-poverty programs, and so on.
This has helped to lower not only poverty, but also inequality, Latin America’s traditional scourge.
According to the economist Nora Lustig, between 2000 and 2010, “income inequality…declined in all 17 Latin American countries for which comparable data exist.”
The decline was especially pronounced in the three largest countries – Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina – which comprise nearly 75% of the region’s population.
One difference in Venezuela is that Chávez spent more than $1 trillion to achieve the same feat – in a country with a population one-sixth the size of Brazil’s and slightly more than one-quarter the size of Mexico’s.
While the long-term viability and effectiveness of conditional cash-transfer programs in Brazil and Mexico is questionable, these anti-poverty initiatives certainly are better designed than Chávez’s massive, blanket subsidies on everything from poultry and flour to housing and gasoline.
Then there is the destruction of Venezuelan industry, the spectacular increase in violence, the explosion of foreign debt, and the depletion of foreign-currency reserves that has accompanied Chávez’s so-called “Bolivarian socialism of the twenty-first century.”
None of these problems has afflicted the region’s other large countries – or at least not to anywhere near the same extent.
If Chávez had not played with the numbers, as demagogues and populist leaders tend to do, the results would be more disheartening.
The second argument in defense of Chávez’s legacy is a bit more robust, but not much.
True, Venezuela’s immense natural riches have been exploited and often squandered by elites more accustomed to the boulevards of Miami than to the slums of Caracas.
But it is equally true that Venezuela enjoyed 40 years of democratic rule before Chávez, under the 1958 Punto Fijo Pact, whereby two parties, one social democratic and the other social Christian, alternated in power peacefully.
Venezuela also boasted one of the region’s most vibrant civil societies, with some of its freest and most vigorous media.
With the exception of the Caracazo – a wave of protests against free-market reforms in 1989 that resulted in an estimated 3,000 deaths – there were only minor bouts of repression.
To be sure, large swaths of Venezuelan society rightly felt excluded from the country’s cozy elite consensus and insular governing arrangements, and resented it immensely; but an aspiring middle class comprised roughly half the population.
Chávez exploited – and widened – that division; indeed, as the current campaign to elect his successor shows, the country remains more polarized than ever.
It may well be that Chávez’s purported feats and popularity will outlast him.
Instead of a simple rotation of elites in power, perhaps what occurred during his time in office was the advent of political leadership that looks, talks, worships, and loves like the people of the country – leadership that identifies with and benefits the millions of Venezuelans who previously were marginalized.
In that case, Chávez’s designated successor, Nicolás Maduro, will make short work of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles in the upcoming election.
Chavismo will outlive Chávez.
But, whatever the outcome, all the mourning and embalming will not alter a simple fact: Venezuela and its people are not clearly better off than they were 14 years ago.
And whatever modest improvements they may feel in their lives were also secured elsewhere, at a far lower economic and political cost.
Human Change We Can Believe In
Montreal – A recent symposium on evolution in Montreal posed to high-school students and university professors the following question:&nbsp;“Do you think that humans are still evolving?”
Approximately 80% of the audience answered “no.”
Indeed, there is an almost universal belief that, with multifaceted cultures and intricate technology, humans have freed themselves from the pressures of natural selection.
Recent findings, however, show otherwise.
Far from providing immunity against evolutionary pressures, culture often creates new ones.
For example, the genes associated with digestion of lactose are more prevalent in populations that have traditionally bred cattle and consumed milk.
In scientific reviews in Nature Genetics and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the evolutionary biologist Stephen Stearns and his colleagues set out to demonstrate that natural selection operates on contemporary humans.
Supported by extensive genealogies, including centuries of church and national health registries, their argument is convincing.
Indeed, contrary to the widely held assumption that evolution takes millennia to manifest itself, recent evidence suggests that its effects can become visible as quickly as in a few generations.
Rapid evolutionary change, or “contemporary evolution,” is not drastic; humans are not likely to sprout wings a few generations down the road.
Rather, these evolutionary effects are difficult to detect, as they are reflected in a population’s genetic composition.
Contemporary evolution requires a specific set of conditions.
First, the population must comprise individuals with varying characteristics, or traits.
Moreover, members of the population must differ in terms of survival rates, including, most important, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) – the total number of offspring that they produce over a lifetime.
These conditions are fundamentally linked: different values for a particular trait translate into diverse survival rates.
This crucial link facilitates change in a trait’s average value over successive generations.
For example, if larger individuals produce more children than smaller ones, the number of larger individuals would grow, thereby increasing the average size of individuals in the population.
The most significant changes occur when individuals at one end of a trait’s value are heavily favored, pushing the entire population in that direction.
Prevalent human traits are often strongly associated with LRS.
For example, people who first reproduce at a younger age tend to have more children, so selection generally favors those who become parents earlier.
Tall women’s LRS tends to be lower, while tall men’s is higher.
In a recent study, research psychologist Markus Jokela and his colleagues took this link further, connecting LRS to personality.
According to Jokela, selection pressure favors people of both sexes who are extroverted, open to experience, and less anxious.
Moreover, women who are agreeable and less meticulous do better reproductively, while these qualities do not affect men’s LRS at all.
Even certain cultural traits, such as income and wealth, can be connected to LRS: in men, the link is positive; in women, it is negative.
But translating selection pressure into evolutionary change requires another crucial ingredient: the variation observed in the trait should be caused at least in part by genetic differences.
Indeed, evolution is possible only if the resemblance between related individuals has a genetic basis, and is not simply a reflection of a shared environment.
For example, siblings do not have to grow up together for their resemblance to be evolutionarily meaningful, owing to their common genes.
Even when it comes to morphology, personality, and life-history traits – such as age at sexual maturity and fertility – related individuals’ likeness often has a genetic basis.
The conditions required for rapid evolutionary change to occur in human populations exist.
But, given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons – including those related to shared culture or environment – or randomly (“genetic drift”), studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare.
Today’s challenge is to isolate the diverse sources of change.
Recently developed statistical tools have finally made this possible.
With more sophisticated methods, my colleagues and I were reliably able to distinguish genetic changes, and thus to demonstrate an evolutionary shift toward a younger age at first birth in a small, insular population in Québec over the last 140 years.
This discovery challenges another fundamental myth: evolutionary change necessarily benefits the species.
In fact, evolution simply increases the average individual’s reproductive success – with potentially damaging demographic consequences.
So, while contemporary evolution is occurring, adaptation may not always lead to a better life.
Air Pollution’s True Costs
PARIS – Air pollution takes years off people’s lives.
It causes substantial pain and suffering, among adults and children alike.
And it damages food production, at a time when we need to feed more people than ever.
This is not just an economic issue; it is a moral one.
Air pollution can be produced both outdoors and indoors.
For the poorest families, indoor smog from coal- or dung-fired cooking stoves is typically the more serious problem.
As economies develop and start to electrify, motorize, and urbanize, outdoor air pollution becomes the bigger issue.
Cleaner technologies are available, with the potential to improve air quality considerably.
But policymakers tend to focus myopically on the costs of action, rather than the costs of inaction.
With economic growth and rising energy demand set to fuel a steady rise in emissions of air pollutants and rapidly rising concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone in the coming decades, this approach is untenable.
A new OECD report, The Economic Consequences of Outdoor Air Pollution, estimates that outdoor air pollution will cause 6-9 million premature deaths annually by 2060, compared to three million in 2010.
That is equivalent to a person dying every 4-5 seconds.
Cumulatively, more than 200 million people will die prematurely in the next 45 years as a result of air pollution.
There will also be more pollution-related illness.
New cases of bronchitis in children aged 6-12 are forecast to soar to 36 million per year by 2060, from 12 million today.
For adults, we predict ten million new cases per year by 2060, up from 3.5 million today.
Children are also being increasingly affected by asthma.
All of this will translate into more pollution-related hospital admissions, projected to rise to 11 million in 2060, from 3.6 million in 2010.
These health problems will be concentrated in densely populated areas with high PM concentrations, especially cities in China and India.
In per capita terms, mortality is also set to reach high levels in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region, and other parts of Asia, such as South Korea, where aging populations are highly vulnerable to air pollution.
The impact of air pollution is often discussed in dollar terms.
By 2060, 3.75 billion working days per year could be lost due to the adverse health effects of dirty air – what economists call the “disutility of illness.”
The direct market impact of this pollution in terms of lower worker productivity, higher health spending, and lower crop yields, could exceed 1% of GDP, or $2.6 trillion, annually by 2060.
Massive as they are, however, the dollar figures do not reflect the true costs of air pollution.
Premature deaths from breathing in small particles and toxic gases, and the pain and suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, do not have a market price.
Nor does the experience of constantly inhaling foul-smelling air, or forcing your child to wear a face mask just to play outside.
These burdens weigh far more heavily on people than any price tag can represent.
Nonetheless, the truth remains that policymakers tend to respond more to hard figures than to abstract experiences.
So the OECD examined myriad economic studies on air pollution to quantify what people’s health is worth to them.
On average, individuals would be prepared to pay around $30 to reduce their annual risk of dying prematurely by one in 100,000.
Using well-established techniques, these “willingness-to-pay” figures were converted into an overall value of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution, as illustrated, for example, in the OECD’s Mortality Risk Valuation in Environment, Health and Transport Policies.
By that measure, the global cost of premature deaths caused by outdoor air pollution would reach a staggering $18-25 trillion a year by 2060.
Arguably, this is not “real” money, as the costs are not related to any market transactions.
But it does reflect the value people put on their very real lives – and the value they would put on policies that would help to delay their very real deaths.
It is time for governments to stop fussing about the costs of efforts to limit air pollution and start worrying about the much larger costs of allowing it to continue unchecked.
Their citizens’ lives are in their hands.
Kehidupan yang Bebas dan Setara
MADRID – Dalam seperempat abad sejak publikasi pada tahun 1990 mengenai Laporan Pembangunan Manusia yang pertama (Human Development Report), kita telah menorehkan kemajuan yang luar biasa dalam pengentasan kemiskinan dan peningkatan kesehatan, pendidikan, dan kondisi kehidupan ratusan juta penduduk dunia.
Meskipun demikian, sejumlah pencapaian yang membanggakan ini belum merata penyebarannya.
Baik itu antar negara maupun di dalam negeri, masih terlihat tingginya ketimpangan dalam hal pembangunan manusia.
Contohnya kematian bayi.
Di Islandia, dari setiap 1.000 anak yang dilahirkan, dua anak meninggal dunia sebelum menginjak usia 1 tahun.
Di Mozambik, angka kematian bayi adalah 120 per 1.000 kelahiran hidup.
Demikian pula di Bolivia, bayi yang lahir dari ibu yang tidak berpendidikan memiliki kemungkinan dua kali lebih besar akan meninggal di bawah usia 1 tahun dibandingkan bayi yang dilahirkan seorang ibu yang setidaknya menyelesaikan pendidikan sekunder.
Seorang anak berusia lima tahun yang dilahirkan ke dalam keluarga berpendapatan rendah di Amerika Tengah, rata-rata memiliki tinggi badan yang 6 cm lebih pendek dibandingkan anak di keluarga berpendapatan tinggi.
Perbedaan tersebut terjadi karena berbagai alasan.
Diantaranya adalah “vertical inequalities” seperti ketimpangan distribusi pendapatan, serta “horizontal inequalities” seperti perbedaan yang ditemukan dalam kelompok karena faktor-faktor seperti ras, jenis kelamin, dan etnis, selain itu juga perbedaan yang terbentuk antar komunitas karena pemisahan wilayah pemukiman.
Banyak orang mengalami berbagai jenis diskriminasi di saat yang sama dan kadang pengucilan yang mereka derita adalah akibat dari interaksi.
Gabungan antara kesenjangan/ketidaksetaraan yang bersifat vertikal dan horizontal ini bisa menyebabkan memperpanjang kemiskinan dan ketimpangan inter-generasi.
Kita patut bersyukur, kesadaran atas dampak buruk dari ketimpangan terhadap demokrasi, pertumbuhan ekonomi, perdamaian, keadilan, dan pembangunan manusia kini semakin meningkat.
Semakin jelas juga bahwa ketimpangan mengikis kohesi sosial dan menaikkan risiko kekerasan dan ketidakstabilan.
Pada akhirnya, kebijakan-kebijakan ekonomi dan sosial menjadi ibarat dua sisi mata koin, saling berkaitan walaupun tidak sama persis.
Selain alasan moral untuk menurunkan ketimpangan, disini terdapat alasan ekonomi.
Jika ketimpangan terus meningkat, perlu adanya pertumbuhan yang lebih tinggi untuk memberantas kemiskinan ekstrem dibandingkan dengan kondisi apabila manfaat ekonomi tersebar dengan lebih merata.
Tingginya ketimpangan juga berkorelasi dengan kemungkinan adanya political capture oleh sekelompok elit yang ingin membela kepentingannya dengan menghambat reformasi egaliter.
Permasalahannya, tidak hanya ketimpangan akan melemahkan uyaya perwujudan tujuan bersama dan ketersediaan common good, tapi juga bisa menciptakan hambatan struktural pada pembangunan, contohnya dengan pajak regresif dan penurunan investasi untuk pendidikan, kesehatan, atau infrastruktur.
Pertumbuhan saja tidak akan menjamin terciptanya akses yang sama pada barang publik dan jasa berkualitas, tetap dibutuhkan kebijakan yang terencana.
Sejarah terkini di Amerika Latin, kawasan di dunia dengan ketimpangan tertinggi, memberikan contoh baik tentang hal-hal yang dimungkinkan ketika kebijakan semacam itu diterapkan.
Kawasan ini berhasil memperbaiki inklusi sosial dalam dekade pertama di abad ini melalui gabungan antara dinamisme ekonomi dan komitmen politik yang konstan untuk melawan kemiskinan dan ketimpangan sebagai kedua permasalahan yang saling bergantung (interdependent).
Berkat upaya ini, Amerika Latin adalah satu-satunya kawasan di dunia yang berhasil menurunkan kemiskinan dan ketimpangan, sembari meningkatkan pertumbuhan ekonomi.
Lebih dari 80 juta penduduk beralih ke kelas menengah, untuk pertama kalinya melampaui jumlah penduduk miskin dan menjadi segmen populasi yang terbesar di kawasan tersebut.
Banyak yang berpendapat bahwa ini dimungkinan oleh kondisi-kondisi eksternal yang menguntungkan, termasuk tingginya harga komoditas sehingga memudahkan ekspansi ekonomi.
Tetapi, bukti dari LAC Equity Lab milik Bank Dunia menegaskan bahwa pertumbuhan hanya berkontribusi sebagian terhadap perbaikan sosial (social gain) yang terjadi di Amerika Latin, selebihnya karena distribusi ulang pengeluaran sosial (social spending).
Memang benar, kebijakan-kebijakan progresif adalah inti dari ekspansi ekonomi itu; adanya generasi baru pekerja berpendidikan tinggi yang memasuki pasar tenaga kerja, mendapat gaji yang lebih besar dan mengambil dividen dari pengeluaran sosial.
Kenaikan upah terbesar terjadi pada kelompok berpendapatan terendah.
Kini Amerika Latin telah memasuki periode pertumbuhan ekonomi yang lebih lambat, prestasi mereka sedang diuji.
Pemerintah memiliki ruang fiskal yang lebih sedikit dan sektor swasta kurang mampu menciptakan lapangan kerja.
Upaya untuk menurunkan kemiskinan dan ketimpangan berisiko akan tertunda atau bahkan terhenti.
Para pembuat kebijakan di kawasan ini harus bekerja keras untuk mempertahankan kemajuan dalam pembangunan manusia jangka panjang.
Pentingnya menurunkan ketimpangan telah diabadikan dalam prinsip-prinsip Revolusi Perancis, kata-kata di dalam Deklarasi Kemerdekaan Amerika Serikat, dan target-target yang ditetapkan pada Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan PBB.
Upaya ini merupakan landasan membentuk dunia yang tidak hanya berkeadilan, tapi juga damai, sejahtera, dan berkelanjutan.
Jika Deklarasi Universal Hak Asasi Manusia menyatakan “semua orang dilahirkan merdeka (bebas) dan memiliki hak yang sama”, bukankah kita semua layak senantiasa menjalani kehidupan seperti itu?
Human Evolution: No Easy Fix
MADISON –Humans are undeniably complex, and proud of it.
No case, we believe, needs to be made for our biological superiority.
Our biological functions are exquisitely regulated and resilient to external variations, owing to complicated webs of interactions.
Unlike other species, we seem to be endowed with willpower and intellect, hence we are capable of modifying the environment to buffer the effects of our decreasing fitness.
Be that as it may, we may be doomed as a species precisely because of the way in which our complexity arose.
Paraphrasing the science writer Philip Ball, nature seems to have activated a time bomb, and our complexity is only a short-term fix.
To grasp the nature of the problem, we need to examine how humans are made at the molecular level, and contrast our constitution with that of other species that we often call “rudimentary,” such as unicellular organisms.
This analysis leads us to examine proteins – our cellular building blocks and the executors of biologicalfunctions – across vastly different species.
Proteins with common ancestry belonging to different species, termed “orthologs,” offer solid ground for comparison.
It has been generally recognized that the basic “fold,” or shape, of a protein must be conserved across species, because there is a tight correspondence between structure and function.
Proteins that retain the same function across very different species – generally the case with orthologs – are expected to keep the same fold.
But the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein chains in these orthologs can vary significantly.
Sometimes the extent of sequence identity between two orthologs can be as low as 25-30%, and yet their folds remain strikingly similar, attesting to the robustness of function to evolutionary change.
This conservation of the protein fold across species makes the origin of our complexity even more puzzling, as it is well known that the number of human genes is deceptively small, merely one order of magnitude larger than that of, say, rice.
If the structure of the proteins is conserved across species, where is our complexity coming from?
Better still, in what sense are we more complex?
Researchers have recently discovered subtle structural variations occurring in orthologs from species that diverged from each other billions of years ago.
In these structures, something subtler than overall topology changes across orthologs.
The structure in some seems “looser” than in others – less well packed, with surface regions that enable surrounding water to penetrate and disrupt the structure by interacting favorably with the protein backbone.
These structural vulnerabilities are known as dehydrons.
As we examine orthologs, the proteins become more degraded, or richer in dehydrons, in species with a lower effective population – a somewhat elusive indicator inversely related to the size and complexity of the organism and to the complexity of its reproductive pattern.
Thus, humans (or mammals) have significantly smaller (ten or more orders of magnitude) populations than bacteria.
The observation that structural degradation is a reflection of decreasing species population resonates in the field of evolution, because natural selection becomes more inefficient as the population gets smaller.
Structural degradation is thus an indicator of the species’ exposure to random genetic drift: mildly deleterious mutations that would typically degrade the protein structure are more likely to be selected against in bacteria before they can become fixed in the entire population (estimated in trillions of individuals), whereas such a mutation has a far better chance of prevailing in humans.
A protein that is richer in dehydrons than its ortholog is more vulnerable to becoming disrupted by surrounding water.
Precisely for this reason, it becomes more “needy” – that is, more reliant on binding partners to maintain its structural integrity.
Furthermore, dehydrons are known to be sticky, so structurally degraded proteins are more likely to promote protein-protein associations than orthologs with lower dehydron content.
Thus, protein-protein interactions, a hallmark of complexity, are actually promoted by randomdrift, the evolutionary force behind the protein degradation process.
So, it seems, complexity is not really naturally selected, but instead arises as a short-term fix to the effects of selection inefficiency.
At first reading, this assertion seems counterintuitive, but the root of the paradox is simply our dogmatic way of thinking, where complex traits are expected to be an outcome of natural selection.
And where is nature’s gambit taking us?
The proteins with the largest accumulation of structural defects are the prions, soluble proteins so poorly wrapped that they relinquish their functionally competent fold and form aberrant aggregates that may cause degenerative neuropathies.
This extreme case of an “aberrantly needy protein” illustrates the high level of genetic risk to which we are exposed as a result of our small population.
The prion is a “fitness” catastrophe that gives us clues as to where nature’s gambit might lead humanity.
Perhaps the long-term evolutionary cost of our complexity is too high, with our survival as a species ultimately depending on our ability to mitigate its fitness cost through increasingly arduous therapeutic solutions.
Let’s hope we pass the test.
Something to Smile About
LONDON – As I put pen to paper, my wife threw out a seasonal challenge: “Christmas is approaching – the time for peace and joy and all that.
Can’t you write about something that will make people happy?”
What sounds like a light-hearted request is actually a formidable task.
Ebola is decimating lives and livelihoods in West Africa.
A legion of Islamist thugs is terrorizing Syria and Iraq.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
Add to that a faltering global economy, and there seems to be little “holiday cheer” on offer.
But happiness is a complex phenomenon.
People living poorly may feel happier more often than their more “fortunate” counterparts.
It is this kind of contradiction that has fueled research in the social sciences and neurology devoted to answering the age-old question: What is the secret to happiness?
Of course, the tools that scientists are using – from advanced imaging to examine the brain’s pleasure centers to microeconomic happiness equations – are not proven in this area.
Can an algorithm, however well researched and carefully crafted, ever really capture the relationship between happiness and factors like income, health, lifespan, and education?
In any case, it is clear that happiness is not dictated by one’s job title or bank balance.
The British comedian Spike Milligan may have wanted the chance to prove that money couldn’t buy him happiness.
But he undoubtedly would have conceded that other factors – like good health and close friends – did much to improve his state of mind.
Even seemingly mundane activities can – and should – bring considerable happiness, as they can represent significant progress.
My visit to the dentist last week, for example, was far superior to my childhood visits.
As a child, the mere sight of the dentist chair would cause me to break out in a cold sweat, as I anticipated my forthcoming encounter with the battery of gleaming instruments seemingly designed for the principal purpose of causing excruciating pain.
My most recent experience, by contrast, was uncomplicated, even comfortable.
And I was not a child that long ago.
Imagine a child’s experience a century ago or earlier.
Some 5,000 years ago, the Chinese used acupuncture, not dental care, to treat toothaches.
Aristotle was preoccupied with dental issues, writing about treatments of decayed teeth and gum disease, extractions conducted with forceps, and the use of wire to stabilize fractured jaws.
The classical Sanskrit writer Vagbhata described 75 oral diseases.
And Shakespeare noted that tooth decay was a cause of awful pain and unpleasant odor.
The pain affected rich and poor alike.
Queen Elizabeth I of England used bits of cloth to plug the gaps in her teeth, in order to improve her appearance.
Louis XIV of France had all of his upper teeth removed after a dentist fractured his jaw trying to extract a lower molar.
So many people lost their teeth that dead people’s teeth were recycled.
The teeth of the 50,000 soldiers killed at Waterloo in 1815 were extracted and used until the 1860s as replacements for the toothless.
Even in my own lifetime, tooth loss was commonplace.
My grandmother lost all of her teeth during her life, and my parents lost many of theirs.
They used to pop their dentures into a mug of whitener every night.
Of course, dental maladies have not been eliminated.
Today, 30% of those aged 65-75 worldwide are toothless, with poor and disadvantaged groups recording the highest rates.
But the overall rate is falling.
My friend’s young daughter, who recently asked if she would ever have “in and out” teeth like her grandparents, can be relatively confident that she will not.
Even if she did, however, she would not face the barriers that people with poor dental health confronted in the past.
Potential army recruits were turned away if they had tooth decay or missing teeth, because they would be unable to bite open a powder cartridge for a musket or use their teeth to remove a grenade’s safety clip; they would also struggle to eat properly.
During the Boer War, the British had to send mincing machines to South Africa, so that soldiers were not forced to choke down unmasticated lumps of meat.
It seems that the American writer and journalist P.J. O’Rourke had a point when he argued that the best thing about living in the twenty-first century, versus some “golden age” of the past, is modern dentistry.
Why not take teeth – their relative cleanliness and health – as a mark of economic progress and human happiness?
It is, of course, unlikely that dental health will ever secure a place on the United Nations development agenda.
But it does offer a straightforward indicator of relative wellbeing.
And given how painful a dental condition can be, dentistry deserves a place of honor on next spring’s UN-sponsored International Day of Happiness.
Whatever political horrors may be afflicting the world, there is something for many of us to smile about: a clean, healthy, and pain-free set of pearly whites.
In fact, delegating sensitive tasks to such “stupid” agents is one of the future risks.
Humanity’s Stake in Gaza
Amman – Wasted time is always to be regretted.
But in the Middle East, wasting time is also dangerous.
Another year has now passed with little progress in bridging the divide between Palestinians and Israelis.
The current air strikes on Gaza, and continuing rocket attacks on Askelon, Sderot and other towns in southern Israel, only prove how dire the situation is becoming.
The security impasse that exists between Israel and the Gazan-Palestinian leadership has also led to blockades of food aid by Israel that have left Gaza’s 1.5 million people facing conditions of real hunger.
Israel, it seems, is once again emphasizing the primacy of “hard” security in its dealings with the Palestinians of Gaza, but this focus only serves to block non-violent opportunities for creative solutions to the Israel-Palestine dispute.
Making matters worse, Israeli politicians remain committed to further enlargement of Israel’s West Bank settlements.
Pushed to the wall in this way, many Palestinians are beginning to see no other option for fulfilling their national aspirations than radical tactics.
Given that this risks renewed violence, it is critical that Israel’s regional partners and international actors understand that Palestinians will not be diverted from their strategic objective of achieving an independent state.
The Palestinian people will never abandon their national struggle.
Both Israelis and Palestinians must understand that the mere application of force will never be enough to achieve their long-term ends.
What is needed is a viable option for the opposing party to adopt in order for violence not to be deployed.
Although force sometimes has its uses, a stable and lasting peace can be delivered only by an integrative, compromise solution.
Conflict resolution, if it is to be successful, requires channeling the energy generated by conflict toward constructive and nonviolent alternatives.
This diversion of the energy of war can take place at any stage of the cycle of escalation, but if preventive peace building is not launched at the first sign of trouble, and problems remain unaddressed as the conflict intensifies (especially if it turns violent), some type of intervention will be needed.
Only then can conciliation, mediation, negotiation, arbitration, and collaborative problem-solving processes establish themselves.
In the end, reconstruction and reconciliation are the only viable means to bring stability, since it cannot be imposed.
None of this is surprising. But it begs the question of why there has not been a more concerted and concentrated focus on transforming the situation in Gaza and Palestine.
An international protectorate for the area to protect the Palestinians from their own more dangerous elements, the Palestinians from the Israelis, and perhaps even the Israelis from themselves, has been proposed, but has received scant acknowledgement.
It is this lack of a coordinated attempt to structure an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians – a structure based on an inclusive, interdisciplinary, and systemic approach that can shift the variables and lead to a peace that both peoples regard as equal and fair – that most concerns those of us who work in international crisis resolution.
One key element in building up a structure for reconciliation must be economic growth.
As the World Bank has emphasized repeatedly, there is a strong correlation between poverty and conflict.
So bridging the human dignity deficit, the divide between haves and have-nots, will be essential to reaching any viable political settlement between Palestinians and Israelis.
Yet the efforts here are piecemeal – and thus insufficient to offer real hope for better lives.
Palestinians and Israelis need to establish viable dialogues across the huge social fissures that divide them, as well as dialogues between the authorities and ordinary people who live in a state of confusion about what is being done in their name.
Trust needs to be rebuilt if we are to help the parties understand how to overcome past enmities.
Only the beginning of public trust will allow problems to be correctly diagnosed and addressed.
Of course, Israel’s need for security must be understood by all sides, but confidence-building measures are needed from all sides as well.
What is now needed most of all is a clear message that dialogue, not violence, is the way forward in these very tense times.
In Gaza, mankind’s basic morality is at stake.
The suffering and wanton destruction of people’s lives, the despair and absence of human dignity in this region have gone on for too long.
The Palestinians of Gaza – indeed, all those across the region who lead blighted lives without hope – cannot wait for new administrations or international institutions to act.
If the Fertile Crescent is not to become a futile crescent, we must wake up and find the moral courage and political vision for a quantum leap in Palestine. 
Humanizing the Human Genome Project
COLD SPRING HARBOR – Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2000, genome science has accelerated at a remarkable rate.
Rapid advances in DNA-sequencing technology mean that affordable decoding of the human genome is not far away.
In fact, human genomes could be sequenced for as little as $1,000 in the next few years.
Unfortunately, the current biomedical research establishment is entirely unprepared for such a scenario.
Researchers often believe that their mission is to uncover new biology and genetics, and that someone else will translate them to the clinical arena.
Accordingly, many geneticists have worked on “big-science” genomics, including genome-wide association studies focused on common genetic variation in the human species.
But it is widely known that certain mutations can run in families, increasing dramatically the risks of certain diseases – for example, breast cancer, sickle-cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.
Unfortunately, many human molecular geneticists have abdicated any responsibility for trying to decrease the overall burden of such diseases.
While this trend has many causes – most of which have been debated extensively – one very important factor is rarely discussed.
Scientific research – and biomedical research in particular – largely resembles a race.
Human geneticists, like big-game hunters, specialize in finding disease genes – the “prize.”
Once they succeed, they usually do not continue to develop their findings; instead, they move on to their next target.
Today, scientists are rewarded for how many papers they publish, and in which journals.
In the United States, several major genome-sequencing centers exist primarily to conduct research – including the Centers for Mendelian Genomics, which seek to find the genetic basis of “simple” Mendelian disorders (diseases caused by a single mutation in the structure of DNA).
Many other countries are undertaking similar programs.
But the discoveries and published papers rarely benefit the people who enable this research by donating their blood and other tissue samples.
As Michael Nielsen discusses in his recent book Reinventing Discovery, the “publish or perish” mentality that dominates the field means that many substandard or incomplete papers are published, while those people who are supposed to benefit from the research are often little more than an afterthought.
Indeed, research volunteers rarely receive their genomic data, which betrays the trust that participants place in researchers to use their findings not only to increase the stock of scientific knowledge, but also to deliver actionable results.
The personal genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe has created a useful interface for returning results, which could easily be built upon to deliver complete genome data to participants – as long as the sample collection and sequencing are performed to a sufficiently high clinical standard.
The company’s model laudably calls for research participants to help in the analysis of their own genomes, thereby relieving researchers of the burden of returning all results at once.
With expanding knowledge, analyzing genomes becomes easier.
The hope is that, as technology develops, more researchers will recognize the importance of returning results – especially those that could have a significant medical impact – to participants.
Because there is no regulation requiring that initial sequencing of human genomes be performed to clinical standards, most sequencing does not meet laboratory-test criteria.
Indeed, results are often not reproducible – badly conceived, poorly conducted, or outright fraudulent.
Criteria must therefore be established to ensure that sequencing is performed in an appropriate clinical environment, with rigorous standards in place, including for sample collection.
Researchers today face the wrong incentives, which results in the failure to translate findings into meaningful action for research participants.
Only by improving clinical standards and returning results to participants can human genome sequencing truly serve its purpose – to help humanity.
Human Rights Require Stronger Institutions
PARIS – Sixty years ago this week, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first international proclamation of the inherent dignity and equal rights of all people.
To this day, the Universal Declaration remains the single most important reference point for discussion of ethical values across national, ideological, and cultural divides.
Yet the Declaration’s enlightened vision of individual freedom, social protection, economic opportunity and duty to community is still unfulfilled.
Tragically, genocide is happening again, this time in Sudan.
A heightened security agenda since the attacks on the United States in September 2001 has included attempts to legitimize the use of “extraordinary rendition” (the movement between countries of prisoners and suspects without due process of law) and torture.
For women around the world, domestic violence and discrimination in employment are a daily reality.
Minorities suffer stigma, discrimination, and violence in developed and developing countries.
The right to information is denied to millions through censorship and media intimidation.
Poverty is our greatest shame.
At least one billion very poor people, 20% of humanity, are daily denied basic rights to adequate food and clean water.
While gross inequalities between rich and poor persist, we cannot claim to be making adequate progress toward fulfilling the ambitions set down 60 years ago.
As we mark this anniversary, the question is how to protect the inherent dignity and equal rights of all people.
A key part of the answer lies in more effective systems of accountability, so that rights are recognized and laws enforced.
Yet if we take a long, hard look at what has been achieved over the past six decades – and at what remains resistant to all our efforts – then it is also clear that this will not be enough.  
The deepest challenges of discrimination, oppression, injustice, ignorance, exploitation, and poverty cannot be addressed through the law or policy alone.
If we are to make reforms sustainable and ensure that they truly protect human rights, we need effective institutions of government.
Poorly equipped or corrupt institutions are a primary obstacle to the effective protection and promotion of human rights.
In recent years, billions of dollars have been invested by governments, businesses, and private philanthropy in fighting poverty in poor countries.
Millions of people have benefited.
Yet those involved have recognized publicly that without greatly improved institutional capacity – for example, well-resourced and competent local and national health systems – further progress will be limited.
Similarly, billions of people are today unable to access or protect their legal rights because judicial and law enforcement systems are impoverished or lack integrity.
Changing this will require massive investment in courts, judicial officials, police, prison systems, social ministries, and parliaments, as well as in national human rights institutions and other official monitoring bodies.
Nothing on this anniversary is more important than to urge our leaders to recognize the scale of the task and commit to sustained action to build institutional capacities to protect human rights, starting in their own countries.
As world leaders race to address the current global economic crisis, it may seem unrealistic to be calling for large and long-term investments of this kind.
But, while stabilizing the international financial system is important, doing so won’t solve wider challenges of governance.
Human rights cannot be realized in the absence of effective institutions.
Where courts and police are corrupt, over-burdened and inefficient, basic civil rights will be violated.
Where social ministries are under-resourced, disempowered, or lack qualified staff, basic rights to adequate health care, education, and housing will remain unfulfilled. 
Even the world’s richest nation, the United States, struggles to implement much needed reforms for some of its most important social institutions – including its health and education systems.
Think how much more difficult this challenge is for the world’s developing nations.
Making progress is a great test of political maturity.
It is, nevertheless, essential if we are to make rights a reality for all. 
Over the past year, as members of The Elders – a group of leaders formed under Nelson Mandela’s inspiration – we have been working with a range of partner organizations to send a human rights message to the world through the Every Human Has Rights Campaign.
Thanks to this collective effort, tens of thousands of individuals – and millions more through schools, community groups, trade unions, and civil society organizations – have come to identify again, or for the first time, with the goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
This is reason for hope. 
We have better tools to communicate and demand justice than any generation before us.
We have global goals and shared destinies that connect us.
What is needed now are leadership, resources, a greater sense of urgency, and commitment to the long-term efforts that must dedicated to ensuring that the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration are not only recognized universally, but respected as well.
Humpty Dumpty and Global Financial Imbalances
WASHINGTON, DC: There is an old saying that goes, “If you have only a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”
Nowhere is this clearer than in discussions of the United States’ trade deficit and global financial imbalances, given economists’ tendency to reduce most economic problems to questions of savings. Unfortunately, this focus on savings distorts understanding and distracts from the real challenge of creating mass consumption markets in developing countries.
Within national income accounts, trade deficits represent the excess of a country’s consumption over production.
From an accountant’s perspective, that makes it logical to label trade deficits as negative savings.
Most economists go a step further, asserting that the US deficit is caused by a savings shortage.
But, since one country’s trade deficit is another’s surplus, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued for turning the conventional logic on its head: rather than resulting from a savings shortage, the US trade deficit is the result of a global savings glut – especially in China.
Both stories are flawed.
How does a savings glut translate into exports, given that households do not export?
Likewise, if the US is consuming too much, why has it been closing manufacturing capacity, and why is there so much labor market softness?
Both the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses confuse accounting outcomes with causes.
Trade deficits reflect transactions between producers and buyers, and those transactions are the result of incentives and price signals.
US consumers buy imports rather than American-made goods because imports are cheaper.
This price advantage is often due to exchange rates in places like China and Japan, whose currencies are undervalued by between 25% and 40%, which often offsets US efficiency advantages.
Undervalued exchange rates are only one of the policies that countries use to boost exports and restrain imports, so that they run trade surpluses, while their trading partners (including the US) run deficits.
Policies aimed at ensuring export-led growth also include export subsidies and barriers to imports.
In the modern era of globalization, export-led growth is supplemented by policies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), a combination that has been particularly successful in China.
Such FDI policies include investment subsidies, tax abatements, and exemptions from domestic regulation and laws.
These policies encourage corporations to shift output to developing countries, which gain modern production capacity. This increases developing countries exports and reduces their import demand (or increases it at a lower rate than export growth).
Meanwhile, corporations reduce home country manufacturing capacity and investment, which reduces home country exports while increasing imports.
Once again, China provides clear evidence of these patterns, with almost 60% of Chinese exports being produced by foreign corporations.
This story is fundamentally different from the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses, and it leads to dramatically different policies.
Developing countries need to grow, but nowadays it is easier to acquire capacity and grow through FDI than it is to develop domestic mass consumption markets.
Consequently, rather than facing a savings glut, the global economy faces a problem of demand failure in developing countries.
The challenge is to get corporations to invest in developing countries, but for purposes of producing for local consumers.
That requires expanding markets in developing countries, which means tackling income inequality and getting income into the right hands – an enormous organizational challenge that is off the radar because economists focus exclusively on savings and supply-side issues.
Labor standards, minimum wages, and unions are part of the solution, as they were in countries that developed successfully.
Unions have historically been especially important since they engage in decentralized wage bargaining that tie wages to firms’ productivity.
Consequently, wages are market sustainable.
Government spending can also help, but its role is limited.
Countries that substitute government spending for market spending either generate inflationary budget deficits, or end up with excessively high tax rates that destroy incentives.
But no solution is possible until we abandon the savings shortage and savings glut hypotheses and connect today’s global financial imbalances with global production patterns and inadequate demand in developing countries.
Tortuous claims that saving is merely the flip side of consumption and investment spending are the economic equivalent of Humpty Dumpty’s argument in Through the Looking Glass : “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean.”
Humpty-Dumpty Iraq
Iraq’s draft constitution will probably be approved in the referendum to be held on October 15.
But whether it is ratified or not ultimately does not matter, as the constitution – and the whole constitution-making process – is totally out of touch with the realities of a country that no longer exists as a coherent body politic.
The problem is not with the constitution, but with the conventional wisdom – almost an idée fixe – that Iraq is a viable modern nation-state, and that all it needs to make it work properly is the right political institutions.
But this is a fallacy, and responsible leaders should begin to think of alternatives.
The Iraqi state, established in the 1920’s by British imperialist planners (with Winston Churchill in the lead), is a strange pastiche of three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire: Mosul in the north with a Kurdish majority, Baghdad in the center with a Sunni Arab majority, and Basra in the south with a Shia Arab majority.
For their own political reasons, the British put the Sunni Arabs – never more than 25% of the population – in control of the whole country, and even imported a Sunni Arab Hashemite prince to rule over their creation.
Ever since, the country could be held together only by an iron fist: Iraq’s history is replete with Shia, Kurdish, and even Christian Assyrian revolts, all put down in bloody fashion by the ruling Sunni minority.
Throughout its history, modern Iraq has always been the most oppressive of the Arab countries.
Saddam’s rule was only the most brutal in a long line of Sunni regimes.
It was this Sunni hegemony – and not merely that of Saddam’s Ba’athist regime – that was toppled by the United States.
But, given Iraq’s history and demography, the American attempt to refashion the country as a functioning democracy has foundered on three shoals: the Shia majority’s empowerment, the Kurds’s refusal to give up their hard-won de facto mini-state in the north, and the Sunnis’ violent campaign to undermine any system that they do not lead.
In short, the draft constitution is an attempt to square a circle. The Sunni resistance – a guerilla and terrorist war that was well prepared in the last years of Saddam’s rule – will continue to try to subvert any semblance of order representing the current majority Shia-Kurdish coalition.
The Sunnis will go on with their murderous attacks on Shias, Kurds, and the US-led military coalition. They will probably boycott the constitutional referendum and all subsequent elections, just as they have boycotted the previous elections.
After all, given the brutal logic of their long hegemony in Iraq, why should the Sunnis contemplate submitting to a process that is premised on their minority status, particularly when whole areas of the country are under the effective control of the Sunni insurgency?
Similarly, why should the Shias, for their part, submit to Sunni hegemony rather than building up their own political structure in the south, modeled on what the Kurds have already achieved in the north?
Let’s be frank: Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia as it disintegrated in the early 1990’s.
This should be acknowledged and ultimately welcomed, despite conventional diplomatic norms regarding the inviolability of the territorial integrity of existing states.&#160;
Of course, such norms are helpful.
But once a state disintegrates, as happened in Yugoslavia, no constitutional formulations can save it.
Constitutions works only if all sides have an interest in operating within the proposed framework – and this obviously is not the case in Iraq.
There is nothing sacrosanct in the continued existence of multi-ethnic and multi-religious states if their constitutive groups do not wish to live together.
On the contrary, there are lessons to be learned from the demise of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and even – perhaps especially – Czechoslovakia, which negotiated its break-up without violence.
By contrast, the current Bosnia-Herzegovina is an example of another failed attempt to keep a decrepit multi-ethnic entity alive: it doesn’t work, and the country is held together only by the almost dictatorial power of the international community’s High Representative and the presence of foreign troops.
It is time to face reality: the Kurdish region in the north is functioning in a reasonable way, and it has even been able to allay Turkey’s fears that its existence will aggravate that country’s own Kurdish problem.
With the Shias building their polity in the south, the Sunni areas too should be allowed to go their own way.
This may be more conducive to peace than trying to impose on them a hated occupation or an equally hated Shia hegemony.
The emergence of three states – or highly autonomous regions – instead of a unified Iraq is happening anyway, constitution or no constitution.
Nobody, it appears, can put Humpty-Dumpty Iraq together again.
But it will require courage to acknowledge what is occurring before our eyes, rather than continue to grasp at the chimera of a consolidated Iraqi state.
In fact, to acknowledge the obvious in Iraq is also to recognize that there are grounds for hope.
As in the former Yugoslavia, the separate entities now emerging may stand a better chance of developing a semblance of representative and eventually democratic governance than if Iraq’s warring communities are forced to live together in the prison house that the country has always been for most of its citizens.
A Clash of Western Civilizations
PARIS – Images from the refugee crisis in Europe have juxtaposed smiling crowds in Vienna and Munich with grim, unwelcoming faces in Budapest.
The result has been a surge of commentary about the “two Europes” – one welcoming, one forbidding.
The truth is that disagreements over whether countries should take in refugees are hardly unique to Europe.
The contrast on display is symptomatic of a deep rift within the Western world.
The divide cuts across the United States, the European Union, and Israel – and, equally important, across Jewish and Christian communities.
On one side are politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, US President Barack Obama, former Israeli Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog, and religious figures like Pope Francis.
On the other are Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán, French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen, US Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, the Cardinal of Hungary, Péter Erdő, and legions of other Eastern European clergy.
Each of the camps shares a fundamental outlook on the role refugees play in society.
The first group consists of those who consider democratic values to be more important than ethnic or national identities.
In their view, anyone who abides by a country’s laws can become a full-fledged citizen and contribute to the vitality of his or her adopted country.
According to this view, inclusion of “the other” – people from different countries and cultures – does not destroy national identity; it enriches it with new ideas and behaviors.
Proponents of such cross-fertilization point to outsiders or their descendants who have attained high positions in their adopted countries: a Latino member of the US Supreme Court, German constitutional lawyers of Turkish origin, French prefects whose parents and grandparents arrived from North Africa, British lords and baronesses with roots in Africa and the Caribbean, and Italian writers of Indian descent.
Accordingly, advocates of this worldview regard fences and walls as insults to humanity, proof that those who build and maintain them have no trust in their countries’ vibrancy and strength.
Above all, they adhere to a universal discourse based on international law and ethical, moral, and religious principles.
Christians and Jews in this camp stress that welcoming strangers and people in need lies at the very heart of their respective faiths.
Taking in the needy is an ethical imperative, not a politically conditioned choice.
Despite the fact that most refugees come from Arab lands known for their anti-Semitism and anti-Israel stance, Jewish intellectuals in this camp have been unanimous in welcoming them with open arms.
Meanwhile, Pope Francis has been clear that Christian values include caring for refugees.
On the other side of the divide are those who fear the other as a threat to national identity.
Their gut-level response is to build fences and walls, as long and as tall as possible, whether on the border between Mexico and the US, on Israel’s border with Egypt, or on Hungary’s border with Serbia (or even with fellow EU member Croatia).
It is no coincidence that Hungarian and Bulgarian policymakers have turned to Israeli companies to seek technical advice on how to build their fences.
Members of this camp do not believe that dynamic civil societies can integrate people of different origins within open democratic settings, or that their countries can benefit from welcoming them.
The risk of a few bad apples (Mexican drug dealers, Islamic terrorists, economic migrants, or those wishing to cash in on welfare systems) outweighs any benefits that the vast majority of young and determined newcomers could bring.
Nor does this camp believe in international conventions on the rights of asylum-seekers or the duty of signatory countries to take them in.
Any appeal to human rights is derided as dangerous naiveté, as are references to moral or religious imperatives.
Instead, the emphasis is on protecting the “nation” against foreign viruses.
These views are promoted not only by politicians, but also by leading religious authorities, including the evangelical right in the US, Catholic prelates in Eastern Europe, and Israel’s nationalist rabbis.
This clash of Western civilizations could not be more important.
Those who shut doors and build walls do not belong to the same family as those who welcome the needy in the name of higher values.
The foundational principles of our democratic traditions are at stake – principles that are being weakened by the clash itself.
Keep the Internet Tax-Free
WASHINGTON, DC – When you spark one of the largest protests in Eastern Europe since the fall of communism, you know that you have stirred up the electorate.
That is exactly what the Hungarian government did when it recently proposed an “Internet tax” of 50 euro cents ($0.62) per gigabyte.
More than 100,000 protesters gathered in Budapest, furious at the political symbolism of the tax and its very real economic impact.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government quickly backed down.
Hungary’s proposed tax was absurd – akin to assessing fees on reading books or charging people to have conversations with friends.
But the proposal, even if discarded (though Orbán has hinted that he may bring it back in another form), remains worrisome, because it is part of a disturbing trend.
A large number of countries have introduced taxes and tariffs that hamper the adoption and use of information and communications technology (ICT).
All together, 31 countries – including Turkey, Brazil, and Greece – add 5% or more to the cost of ICT, on top of standard value-added taxes.
In Hungary, the proposed tax would have been particularly onerous, because it would raise the cost of mobile data by 5-15% and have an even bigger impact on fixed broadband subscriptions.
For the young and the poor, it would be a significant burden.
A cap of €2.30 per person, hastily proposed after the initial public outcry, and before the proposal was withdrawn, would have done little to ease that burden on low-income Internet users, while drastically reducing the program’s overall revenue.
As the protesters in Budapest pointed out, the proposed tax is wrong for Hungary.
It is wrong for other countries, too.
Cash-strapped governments adopt these taxes because ICT goods and services are an easy target for revenue authorities.
In addition, they are sometimes mischaracterized as luxury products – as if the Internet has not become central to peoples’ lives.
These policies are ultimately self-defeating.
The resulting price hikes impede the adoption and use of ICT, lowering tax revenues from purchases of goods and services.
And the evidence shows an even larger indirect effect: restricting ICT adoption dampens growth.
Ultimately, this has a negative impact on total tax revenues, offsetting any gains from fees on Internet use.
One study found that for every dollar equivalent of tariffs India imposed on imported ICT products it suffered an economic loss of $1.30 from lower productivity.
Taxes on ICT are the modern-day equivalent of eating the grain you were saving to plant next year.
The adoption of ICT drives fundamental technological change, potentially transforming a broad range of industries, as well as people’s daily lives.
For businesses, ICT can improve efficiency and facilitate coordination.
For individuals, it can boost incomes and make everyday life more convenient.
The benefits of ICT goods and services grow significantly as more businesses and consumers start to use them.
Smart government policies, such as subsidies or tax breaks for ICT purchases, boost adoption by helping users who would not otherwise be able to afford them.
Taxing the Internet, like other taxes and tariffs on ICT goods and services, has the opposite effect.
Hungary’s proposed tax was especially pernicious, owing to its poor design.
Because the tax was a flat €0.50 per gigabyte, its share in total ICT spending would rise as the cost of a gigabyte fell – as it is almost guaranteed to do.
The cap on such a tax would prevent the rate from spiraling upward, but rising bandwidths would cause most users to max out quickly, affecting not only the poorest consumers, but also new or small businesses.
Keeping poor people and entrepreneurs off the Internet is no way to fund a government.
Countries would be better off with policies that promote ICT: elimination of taxes and tariffs on ICT products and services, removal of non-tariff barriers like requiring local data storage, and encouragement of digital innovation and transformation in economic sectors through regulatory and procurement reform.
The resulting rise in productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth would establish a far more stable and successful foundation for increasing tax revenues.
The European Union as a whole has done a good job of keeping ICT taxes and tariffs low, despite substantial fiscal difficulties in many countries.
Indeed, the overall non-discriminatory tax regime has been an important boon to ICT adoption, and the EU’s commissioner for the digital agenda spoke out strongly against Hungary’s proposed tax, calling it “a particularly bad idea.”
The only EU country with significant taxes on ICT products and services (around 9%) is Greece, something of a special case in Europe.
The recent actions by Hungarian policymakers show that no country is immune to bad policy ideas.
Governments need revenue, but how they raise it shapes their countries’ economies by encouraging some transactions and discouraging others.
Policies that encourage ICT adoption are the right choice for long-term and inclusive economic growth.
As the case of Hungary showed, ultimately it is up to citizens to hold governments accountable and ensure that tax and tariff policies work for the benefit of all.
Hunting the Higgs
CAMBRIDGE – Fifty years ago, particle physicists faced an unexpected challenge.
Their best mathematical models could account for some of the natural forces that explain the structure and behavior of matter at a fundamental level, such as electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactive decay.
But the models worked only if the particles inside of atoms had no mass.
How could huge conglomerations of such particles – proteins, people, planets – behave as they do if their constituent parts weighed nothing at all?
Some physicists invented a clever workaround.
They suggested that a type of particle exists that had never been detected; it was eventually named in honor of the British physicist Peter Higgs.
For a half-century, physicists searched for the elusive “Higgs particle.”
Now, following research conducted at CERN, the sprawling particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, the hunt may soon be over.
At first blush, the idea behind the Higgs particle sounds outlandish.
Higgs and his colleagues suggested that every elementary particle really is massless, just as the mathematical models require, and hence all particles would ordinarily zip around at the speed of light.
But suppose that everything around us – every single particle in the universe – is immersed in a huge, unseen vat of Higgs particles.
Whenever most kinds of particles move from point A to point B, they continually bump into Higgs particles, slowing their motion.
When we observe them, they appear to lumber along like holiday shoppers in a crowded store.
From their slow motion, we infer that they have mass.
While a 50-year search for a hypothetical particle reminiscent of a bizarre fairytale might seem quixotic, the Higgs particle stands at the center of the “Standard Model” of particle physics.
Every experimental test of the model so far has matched theoretical expectations.
In some striking examples, the agreement between prediction and measurement has stretched out to twelve decimal places, making the Standard Model the most accurate scientific theory in human history.
The model successfully accounts for three of the four basic forces of nature; only gravity remains beyond its purview.
Higgs particles might have played an even more substantial role at earlier moments in cosmic history.
My own research, along with that of physicists around the world, has focused on what effects Higgs particles might have had just fractions of a second after the big bang – effects that could explain the shape and fate of the universe.
And yet, for all that, we still have no direct evidence that Higgs particles even exist.
According to the Standard Model, Higgs particles scatter off each other, so they, too, should have mass.
The latest research indicates that Higgs particles (if they exist) should be among the most massive critters of the subatomic realm, more than 120 times as massive as the familiar proton.
To produce such a particle in the laboratory requires revving up protons to nearly the speed of light and smashing them together, which the Large Hadron Collider at CERN accomplishes trillions of times per second.
The energetic collisions produce all manner of debris, which physicists carefully track with huge detectors and sift with sophisticated computer algorithms.
Physicists confront two major hurdles in their hunt for the Higgs.
First, they must identify patterns in the debris that could have come from the production and rapid decay of a Higgs particle.
The sought-after signal is well understood in principle, given what we know about the Standard Model.
So is the background noise from all of the other junk that comes flying out when two protons collide with colossal energy.
Physicists searching for a few Higgs-like needles in a mind-bogglingly large haystack must comb their data for anomalies in the debris that cannot be accounted for by known processes.
The second difficulty concerns statistics.
The rules of quantum theory, on which the Standard Model is built, are at root probabilistic.
There will always be statistical flukes in the data, just as any series of coin tosses can produce an unexpected string of seven heads in a row.
To know with confidence that the coin is ordinary, with no hidden features, one must log a sufficiently large number of coin flips and check whether the data include equal numbers of heads and tails over the long run.
After thousands of coin tosses, if the data still show a bias toward heads, one may be justified in thinking that the coin has some unusual properties.
The same holds true for all of the chaff from the protons’ collisions.
Before physicists can claim that their anomalies really come from Higgs particles, they must gather enough data to rule out flukes.
At CERN, two independent teams of physicists recently announced that their data were consistent with detection of a Higgs particle, though there remained a 1-in-2,000 chance that the signal came from mundane, non-Higgs processes.
So the teams will continue smashing protons together, gathering more data, and sifting for signs of a Higgs.
We might not have the Higgs in hand right now.
But the latest news is the strongest indication yet that the 50-year hunt for one of the most fundamental bits of matter might well be coming to a successful conclusion.
The next time the CERN teams call a press conference, it could be weighty news indeed.
Hurricane Sandy and Climate Change
ATHENS, GEORGIA – In the waning weeks of the North American hurricane season – a time when a superstorm is not expected to cause widespread damage to the eastern coast of the United States – Hurricane Sandy is a grim reminder of the menace of extreme weather events.
With the lowest central pressure of the 2012 hurricane season, Sandy may have caused up to $20 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest superstorms in history.
Sandy interacted with a weather system moving toward it from the east, posing difficult challenges for forecasters and nearly unprecedented weather conditions for the region.
A similar storm hit New England 20 years ago.
But Sandy was worse, delivering hurricane-strength winds, drenching rains, and severe coastal flooding throughout the populous mid-Atlantic and northeast corridor.
Some people will, of course, try to link Sandy with climate change.
A similar rush to judgment occurred in the wake of massive tornado outbreaks in the US in recent years, even though the scientific literature does not offer strong support for such a connection.
So, from the perspective of climate change, it is best to take a measured view of Sandy, lest hasty reaction harm scientific credibility.
But that is little cause for comfort.
According to the giant insurance company Munich Re, weather and climate disasters contributed to more than one-third of a trillion dollars in damage worldwide in 2011, and this year’s total may rival that amount.
There is growing evidence of links between climate change and sea-level rise, heat waves, droughts, and rainfall intensity, and, although scientific research on hurricanes and tornadoes is not as conclusive, that may be changing.
Indeed, recent reports by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific literature suggest that the intensity of tropical cyclones (that is, hurricanes) will increase as a result of warmer waters.
And our atmosphere and oceans are, indeed, warming, with substantial residual heat stored in the ocean, to be released at some future time.
A few studies have even suggested that tropical cyclones may be “wetter.”
It is quite certain that sea levels have risen over the last century, and continue to rise, in response to changing climate.
And storm surges now ride on these elevated sea levels, amplifying flooding losses where they strike.
Sea surface temperatures along the US northeast coast are about five degrees Fahrenheit above average, which helped to intensify Sandy just prior to landfall.
At this point, it is premature to link the storm’s severity to warmer sea-surface temperatures, because regional variability is known to occur.
But the link certainly is plausible.
Moreover, sea levels along the US northeast coast are rising up to four times faster than the global average, making the region more vulnerable to storm surges and flooding.
And here the bottom line is that any coastal storm system will produce more flooding because of sea level rise.
It should also be noted that an atmospheric weather pattern known as a “block,” a persistent area of high pressure that may have led to record melting in Greenland, was most likely the reason that Sandy moved inland rather than out to sea.
It is too early to tell whether this blocking pattern is a manifestation of weather variability, a short-term climate variation, or the result of climate change.
Advances in numerical weather forecasting during the past several decades have extended our ability to “see” into the future.
In September 1938, before all of these advances, a hurricane devastated much of New England.
No warnings were issued prior to its arrival.
Today, thanks to satellites, weather balloons, supercomputers, and skilled forecasters, we can anticipate hazardous weather up to a week in advance.
Similar advances in climate modeling are occurring, thanks to methodological improvements and better data.
At a minimum, we must ensure that world-class weather and climate-modeling centers have the necessary funding and manpower to implement the most advanced forecasting techniques.
Numerical weather forecasting was invented in the US, but today other countries have developed extremely high modeling capacity.
For example, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, in Great Britain, was targeting an East Coast landfall for Sandy days ahead of the best American model.
The world will need more cooperation in the coming years, as climate change begins to interact with and exacerbate extreme weather events, in order to gain the lead-time needed to prepare for disasters.
We will also need the collaboration among governments, the private sector, and academia that often leads to improvements in forecasting.
Scientific meetings are key forums for sharing research, vetting new methodologies, and forging new partnerships.
Many occur on an international basis, and we need to encourage such discourse, even in tough times for government budgets.
It is reasonable to ask how well we would be able to predict or assess a storm like Sandy without the knowledge and capacity gained through such international collaboration.
We do not know whether superstorms like Sandy are harbingers of a “new normal” in the uneasy and unpredictable relationship between climate change and extreme weather events.
That does not mean that there is not or cannot be such a connection, but rather that the scientific research needed to prove (or disprove) it must still be conducted.
That is how good science works.
Sandy has provided a powerful demonstration of the need to support it.
Hu’s Chance
Chinese President Hu Jintao’s upcoming visit to the United States, postponed following hurricane Katrina, will be different from previous bilateral meetings.
This time, the countries’ presidents will meet at a time of intensive American attention to the US-China trade balance and other economic issues, such as protection of intellectual property rights.
With China’s US trade surplus reaching $200 billion last year, American sentiment is growing to take strong measures.
Some have suggested that the trade imbalance is related to China’s currency peg to the US dollar.
A recent Congressional bill has called for imposing a 27.5% punitive tariff on Chinese imports.
In fact, the trade imbalance is more complicated than the currency issue per se.
Globalization has strengthened the ability of capital to flow to wherever investment promises the highest returns; likewise, competitive manufactured products from low-wage economies will flow in the other direction.
That is why China fascinates American investors, among others, and why US customers buy Chinese products.
To be sure, the exchange rate has an impact on investment and trade.
But, even with China’s efforts to loosen the renminbi-dollar linkage, it is arguable whether revaluation could save American jobs or improve the US trade balance.
After all, China is not alone: India and other competitive developing countries pose a similar challenge to the US.
Nevertheless, for China’s part, now seems to be a good time to reflect on how to increase its exports’ value-added, as well as focusing on environmental protection and sustainability.
Thus, there is scope for a compromise that recognizes both sides’ legitimate concerns.
The Chinese government is hastening its shopping spree in America these days, pushing up the renminbi’s exchange rate slowly but steadily.
A sensible US policy on China may be to accept gradual currency appreciation, rather than a large revaluation, as America’s economic vitality stems from its own innovation rather than from concessions by the Chinese government.
A more difficult issue for Hu could be intellectual property rights.
China’s recent campaign to crackdown on pirating needs to be encouraged, but far more needs to be done.
However, while the US government and American companies question whether the Chinese are willing and able to enforce such rights, one must put this issue into historical perspective.
Intellectual property protection is related to economic development, so the question should be whether China has reached the stage at which effective protection is possible.
There is a positive side to such problems, however, namely that their very emergence reflects the deepening and broadening of bilateral relations.
Indeed, Sino-US interaction has been so strong that the two presidents met five times last year.
While those meetings also highlighted trade disputes, they also yielded heightened cooperation and significant accomplishments.
For example, the two states share a common interest in anti-terrorism efforts, and they have been collaborating to ensure container security and combat human trafficking.
Their coordinated efforts to divert North Korea peacefully from its nuclear course have also vindicated bilateral cooperation when both sides can define a common security stake.
Similarly, the two countries have a common interest in stabilizing mainland China’s relations with Taiwan.
The current formula, maintaining the status quo, offers the highest common denominator.
With this strategic understanding, there is good reason to expect that Hu’s talks with Bush on Taiwan’s recent termination of the National Unification Council will serve to reduce tensions.
China and the US both have much to gain by thwarting Taiwan’s move toward independence.
Nevertheless, to American eyes, other contentious issues are now emerging in relations with China.
The recently released National Security Strategy outlines three, in particular: China’s global trade expansion, its military transparency, and its relations with “misruling” states.
The political cost of a serious compromise on these matters would be too high for China, but it does no harm to analyze them and find ways to enhance dialogue.
Among the three issues, military transparency seems to be the most sensitive and difficult to address.
Nevertheless, given the large size of China’s armed forces, which currently stands at 2.3 million, a rough calculation would indicate that monthly spending per soldier is at most 2,500 yuan on average – too low to recruit and retain competitive staff.
But if China wants to raise the military budget to improve the quality of its army, the conflict with the demands of fiscal stability could make military transparency important for domestic reasons, and China might no longer view it as being off limits in its relations with the US.
Above all, we must bear in mind the maturation of Sino-US relations in recent years.
A mature bilateral relationship is one in which even difficult issues can be discussed routinely and promptly.
There is no question that such a framework has already been established in relations with the US.
We will now see how Hu uses that framework – and thus what imprint he leaves on the bilateral relationship – in meeting the current challenges.
The Climate’s Low-Hanging Fruit
NEW YORK – Next month, signatories to the 1989 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer will convene in Kigali, Rwanda, to consider an amendment to the treaty that would gradually reduce, and eventually eliminate, the use of hydrofluorocarbons.
HFCs, which are one of the six main greenhouse gases, are commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration systems worldwide.
The amendment would be a boon for sustainable development, and could prevent the release of as much as 100-200 billion tons of climate-changing emissions by 2050.
That would be enough to take the world a quarter of the way toward achieving the 2º Celsius global-warming target set by the December 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The Montreal Protocol was established to repair the ozone layer, which protects all life on the planet from deadly levels of ultraviolet rays.
So far, it has been a remarkable success, with nearly 100 ozone-destroying chemicals phased out over the past three decades.
The ozone layer is healing and, according to the latest estimates, it could recover by 2065, saving trillions of dollars in global health-care and agriculture costs.
Much of this improvement is thanks to HFCs, which are excellent ozone-friendly alternatives to older chlorofluorocarbons, which have been phased out.
However, HFCs, some of which are 4,000 times more potent as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide, are a disaster for climate change, and their use is still increasing annually by 10%.
It thus makes sense to focus on HFCs in taking action on climate change.
For starters, reducing them can yield economic benefits, owing to the significant energy-efficiency improvements afforded by newer air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.
Just phasing in more efficient air-conditioning systems would be the emissions equivalent of retiring 2,500 medium-size peak power plants (power plants that come on-stream during periods of high demand, such as during the summer).
In China, switching to climate-friendly refrigerants and boosting the energy efficiency of air conditioning and refrigeration could lead to the equivalent in emissions savings of eight Three Gorges hydroelectric dams.
In India, the switch could be equal to two more of the Indian government’s current National Solar Mission, which promotes solar-energy penetration and the construction of new rooftop and ground-mounted solar plants.
Many countries – including the European Union and the United States, as well as Belize, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Egypt, Serbia, and Yemen – already recognize these far-reaching benefits and are taking unilateral action to phase out HFCs.
A strong HFCs agreement in Kigali would add momentum to these efforts and provide financial support for developing countries that want to move to newer technologies but currently can’t afford it.
In the private sector, retail giants such as Walmart, Nestle, and Tesco have joined the Consumer Goods Forum, a cooperative climate initiative, and agreed to phase out products with HFCs.
The United Nations and Greenpeace, through an initiative called “Refrigerants, Naturally!”, are working with Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Redbull, and Unilever to do the same.
The Kigali meeting is set to yield a strong HFCs amendment.
However, some countries in especially hot parts of the world heavily worry that climate-friendly alternatives for their essential air conditioning may not function as well.
Any agreement can account for those concerns through a temporary exemption for those countries, while others move ahead with newer systems to demonstrate their effectiveness.
A warming planet is already having a devastating impact on some of the world’s most vulnerable populations, and it will only continue to do so.
Ultimately, all countries will have to find a way forward on reducing HFCs and climate change generally, through national action plans and emissions reductions agreed to under the 2015 Paris agreement.
Frameworks established by sister agreements like the Montreal Protocol can help to do this.
HFCs will also be a central topic at the next major UN climate change conference, COP22, which convenes in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November.
We are confident that the governments preparing to meet in Kigali understand the need for a strong HFCs amendment, which would give momentum to other agenda items, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in Marrakesh.
If the world is to succeed in quickly reducing global emissions to prevent climate change from reaching catastrophic levels, reducing HFCs is a sensible – perhaps the most sensible – first step.
Hypocrisy on the High Seas?
Thirty years ago, Australian vessels, with the government’s blessing, killed sperm whales off the West Australian coast.
Last month, Australia led international protests against Japan’s plan to kill 50 humpback whales.
Japan, under mounting pressure, announced that it would suspend the plan for a year or two.
The change in public opinion about whaling has been dramatic, and not only in Australia.
Greenpeace began the protests against Australian whaling, and the government appointed Sydney Frost, a retired judge, to head an inquiry into the practice.
As a concerned Australian and a philosophy professor working on the ethics of our treatment of animals, I made a submission.
I did not argue that whaling should stop because whales are endangered. I knew that many expert ecologists and marine biologists would make that claim.
Instead, I argued that whales are social mammals with big brains, capable of enjoying life and of feeling pain – and not only physical pain, but very likely also distress at the loss of one of their group.
Whales cannot be humanely killed – they are too large, and even with an explosive harpoon, it is difficult to hit the whale in the right spot.
Moreover, whalers do not want to use a large amount of explosive, because that would blow the whale to pieces, while the whole point is to recover valuable oil or flesh.
So harpooned whales typically die slowly and painfully.
Causing suffering to innocent beings without an extremely weighty reason for doing so is wrong.
If there were some life-or-death need that humans could meet only by killing whales, perhaps the ethical case against it could be countered.
But there is no essential human need that requires us to kill whales.
Everything we get from whales can be obtained without cruelty elsewhere.
Thus, whaling is unethical.
Frost agreed.
He said that there could be no doubt that the methods used to kill whales were inhumane – he even described them as “most horrible.”
He also mentioned “the real possibility that we are dealing with a creature which has a remarkably developed brain and a high degree of intelligence.”
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser’s conservative government accepted his recommendation that whaling be stopped, and Australia soon became an anti-whaling nation.
While Japan has suspended its plan to kill humpback whales, its Japanese whaling fleet will still kill about 1,000 other whales, mostly smaller minke whales.
Japan justifies its whaling as “research,” because the International Whaling Commission’s rules allow member nations to kill whales for such purposes.
But the research seems to be aimed at building a scientific case for a resumption of commercial whaling; so, if whaling is unethical, then the research itself is both unnecessary and unethical.
Japan says that it wants the discussion of whaling to be carried out calmly, on the basis of scientific evidence, without “emotion.”
The Japanese think that humpback whale numbers have increased sufficiently for the killing of 50 to pose no danger to the species.
On this narrow point, they might be right.
But no amount of science can tell us whether or not to kill whales.
Indeed, Japan’s desire to continue to kill whales is no less motivated by “emotion” than environmentalists’ opposition to it.
Eating whales is not necessary for the health or better nutrition of the Japanese.
It is a tradition that they wish to continue, presumably because some Japanese are emotionally attached to it.
The Japanese do have one argument that is not so easily dismissed.
They claim that Western countries object to whaling because, for them, whales are a special kind of animal, as cows are for Hindus.
Western nations, the Japanese say, should not try to impose their cultural beliefs on them.
The best response to this argument is that the wrongness of causing needless suffering to sentient beings is not culturally specific.
It is, for example, one of the first precepts of one of Japan’s major ethical traditions, Buddhism.
But Western nations are in a weak position to make this response, because they inflict so much unnecessary suffering on animals.
The Australian government strongly opposes whaling, yet it permits the killing of millions of kangaroos each year – a slaughter that involves a great deal of animal suffering.
The same can be said of various forms of hunting in other countries, not to mention the vast amount of animal suffering caused by factory farms.
Whaling should stop because it brings needless suffering to social, intelligent animals capable of enjoying their own lives.
But against the Japanese charge of cultural bias, Western countries will have little defense until they address the needless animal suffering in their own backyards.
Stopping a Dirty Bomb
VIENNA – Nuclear terrorism is, in the words of US President Barack Obama, “the gravest danger we face.”
But while few would dispute this characterization, the world has unfinished business in minimizing the threat.
Ten years after world leaders agreed to amend the landmark 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) to make it harder for terrorists to obtain nuclear material, the new measures have yet to enter into force.
The resulting vulnerability needs to be addressed urgently.
In July 2005, signatories to the CPPNM agreed to amend the Convention to address the risk of terrorism more effectively.
The new measures that were introduced would make it more difficult for terrorists to cause a widespread release of radioactive material by attacking a nuclear power plant or detonating a radioactive dispersal device – commonly known as a dirty bomb.
But before the amendment can enter into force, two-thirds of the 152 signatories to the original convention must ratify it.
While significant progress has been made – in July, the US, Italy, and Turkey did so – at least 14 more countries are needed.
The fact that there has never been a major terrorist attack involving nuclear or other radioactive material should not blind us to the severity of the threat.
There is evidence that terrorist groups have tried to acquire the material needed to construct a crude nuclear explosive device, or a dirty bomb.
In 2011, for example, Moldovan police seized highly enriched uranium from a group of smugglers who were trying to sell it.
The smugglers, exhibiting a worrying level of technical knowledge, had tried to evade detection by building a shielded container.
In this case, the story ended happily.
Thanks to efforts by Moldova, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to boost its nuclear security capabilities, the material was identified and confiscated, and the smugglers were arrested.
There is no way to know whether the smuggling effort uncovered in Moldova is an outlier or the tip of a very large iceberg.
But one thing is certain: the amount of nuclear material in the world is increasing.
Since 1999, the amount of such material being used for peaceful purposes has increased by 70% – a trend that will continue as the use of nuclear power grows.
It is essential that effective measures are in place to ensure that these materials are not misused or misplaced, whether accidentally or intentionally.
Since 1995, the IAEA’s member states have reported nearly 2,800 incidents involving radioactive material escaping regulatory control.
Although only a handful of these incidents involved material that could be used to make a nuclear explosive device, a relatively small amount of radioactive material could be combined with conventional explosives to create a dirty bomb.
Such a weapon could be capable of killing many people, contaminating large urban areas, and sparking mass panic.
Much has been achieved in the secure management of nuclear material since the attacks on the United States in September 2001 prompted a renewed focus on the risks of terrorism.
Many countries have instituted effective measures to prevent the theft, sabotage, or illegal transfer of nuclear or other radioactive material, and security at many nuclear facilities has been improved.
But much more needs to be done.
The original Convention focused only on the international transport of nuclear material, and did not cover the protection of nuclear facilities.
The amendment adopted ten years ago would oblige countries to protect nuclear facilities and any nuclear material used, stored, or transported domestically.
It would expand cooperation on locating and recovering stolen or smuggled nuclear material and coordinate the response to any attack on a nuclear facility.
It would also make nuclear trafficking a criminal offense and require signatories to cooperate on improving national systems of physical protection and minimizing the consequences of sabotage.
Protecting nuclear material is not just an issue for countries that use nuclear power.
Terrorists and criminals will try to exploit any vulnerability in the global security system.
Any country, in any part of the world, could find itself used as a transit point – just as any country could become the target of an attack.
Effective international cooperation is critically important.
The consequences of a major security failure could be a catastrophe that transcends borders.
All countries must take the threat of nuclear terrorism seriously.
The single most effective way to do so would be to ensure that the amendment to the CPPNM enters into force as soon as possible.
America’s Late Imperial Dilemma
NEW YORK – US President Barack Obama is under attack – from so-called liberal hawks, more or less to the left of center, as well as from active interventionists on the right – for being a weak president, leading a war-weary (even world-weary) America in retreat.
Obama’s critics, whether on the left or the right, believe that the United States has a unique calling to impose its will on the world.
The only difference is that the former justify their views with talk of democracy and human rights, while the latter do not need any such justification, because, after all, America is the greatest country on earth.
Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
This opinion was expressed most clearly in a recent article by the conservative foreign-policy thinker Robert Kagan.
Kagan’s argument is that other countries cannot be relied upon to behave responsibly without strong US leadership.
Like other hawks, he warns not only that dictators will behave badly if given the chance, which is certainly plausible, but also that democratic allies need to be kept in their place by a firm hegemonic hand.
In East Asia, for example, China must be “hemmed in” by strong US allies.
But if Japan, America’s main ally in the region, were “much more powerful and much less dependent on the United States for its security,” it, too, should not be trusted.
Kagan may be right in thinking that a precipitous US retreat from East Asia could have dangerous consequences.
But this argument has the familiar whiff of the late stages of empire.
The European imperial powers of the twentieth century would periodically hold out the distant prospect of independence to their colonial subjects – but not yet, not before they were ready, not before their Western masters had educated them to take care of themselves responsibly.
How long this education might take was anybody’s guess.
That is the paradox of imperialism.
As long as the colonized are under the imperial cosh, they can never truly be ready, because the authority to run their own affairs, responsibly or not, was taken away from them.
Empires can impose order and stability for a long time; but imperialists – rather like many Americans today – become tired, and their subjects grow restless.
The imperial order becomes brittle, and, as Kagan rightly notes, when the old order finally breaks down, mayhem often follows.
That happened in India in 1947, when the British left, Pakistan broke away, and roughly a million Hindus and Muslims died in mutual slaughter.
But does this really mean that the British Raj should have lasted longer?
If so, how much longer?
It is just as plausible to argue that prolonged imperial rule could have made ethnic tensions worse.
After all, those tensions were largely the result of colonial divide-and-rule policies.
So it is today, to some degree, with Pax Americana – a kind of imperial world order that was never a formal empire.
Compared to most previous empires, it was relatively benign, though it is too easily forgotten how often the leader of the “Free World” subverted elected leaders and supported dictators, as in Chile, South Korea, El Salvador, Argentina, Indonesia, Guatemala, and so on.
The much-vaunted “liberal order” policed by the US was a product of World War II and the Cold War.
Germany and Japan had to be kept down, the Communist powers had to be contained, and the old countries of Europe had to learn to live with one another under unifying pan-national institutions.
All of this was made possible by American money and military might.
As a result, the Free World, in Western Europe and East Asia, became a US dependency.
This cannot go on forever.
Indeed, the arrangements are already fraying.
But then comes the old imperial paradox.
The longer others remain dependent on the US, the less capable they will be of taking care of their own affairs, including their security.
And, like an authoritarian parent, the US itself, despite its admonitions to its allies to pull their weight, is often loath to let go of its increasingly unruly dependents.
When a new government came to power in Japan in 2009 and tried to break the postwar mold by initiating better relations with China and seeking to reduce its dependence on the US, the Obama administration sought to undermine this effort.
The informal empire would not stand for that kind of insubordination.
In his recent foreign-policy speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, Obama barely mentioned East Asia.
But if any region would benefit from the Obama doctrine, which promises to shift from military to more political approaches to regional problems, it is East Asia.
Still, Obama’s instincts are right.
At least he has recognized the limits of America’s power to impose a global order by force.
His success as a president rests less on the good things he has done (although he has done plenty) than on the stupid things he has avoided, like getting into more unnecessary wars.
This does not resolve the late imperial dilemma of how to reduce dependency on the hegemon without causing more tyranny and violence.
But that painful and risky process will have to be launched eventually, and it will be better served by Obama’s brand of caution than by the tough talk of his critics.
East Asia’s Sins of the Fathers
NEW YORK – One way to look at the growing military tensions over a few tiny islands in the East China Sea is to see in recent events a straightforward case of power politics.
China is rising, Japan is in the economic doldrums, and the Korean peninsula remains divided.
It is only natural that China would try to reassert its historical dominance over the region.
And it is just as natural for Japan to feel nervous about the prospect of becoming a kind of vassal state (the Koreans are more accustomed to this role, vis-à-vis China).
Being subservient to American power, as Japan has been since 1945, was the inevitable consequence of a catastrophic war.
Most Japanese can live with that.
But submission to China would be intolerable.
And yet, because East Asian politics remains highly dynastic, a biographical explanation might be just as useful.
Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, once the top industrial bureaucrat of wartime Japan.
Imprisoned by the Americans as a war criminal in 1945, Kishi was released without trial at the beginning of the Cold War, and was elected Prime Minister as a conservative in 1957.
Kishi was a nationalist with fascist tendencies during the 1930’s and 1940’s.
After the war, an equally deep aversion to Communism made him a staunch ally of the United States; Richard Nixon became a close friend.
His lifelong quest was to revise the pacifist Japanese constitution, written by the Americans just after the war, and turn Japan into a proud military power once more.
Abe’s greatest wish is to complete the project that eluded his grandfather: abandon constitutional pacifism and bury the war crimes of Kishi’s generation, while remaining allied with the US against China.
As a right-wing nationalist, Abe feels compelled to resist the dominance of China, if only rhetorically for the time being.
One of Kishi’s greatest Cold War allies – apart from Nixon – was the South Korean strongman President Park Chung-hee, who came to power in a military coup a year after Kishi resigned as prime minister.
Park, too, had a dubious wartime career.
Under the Japanese name of Takagi Masao, he served as an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army.
He graduated from a military academy in Manchuria, where Kishi had once ruled over an industrial empire that was built on Chinese slave labor.
Like Kishi, Park was a nationalist.
But, apart from his sentimental wartime connections to Japan, his anti-Communism was incentive enough to continue warm relations with the imperial power that had brutally colonized Korea for a half-century.
Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s current president, is his daughter.
Park Geun-hye adored her father at least as much as Abe loved his grandfather, but the result of her dynastic connection is the opposite of Abe’s.
To be seen as a Korean nationalist today, she must distance herself from some of her father’s political ties, especially his links with Japan.
Though still admired by many South Koreans for rebuilding the country from the ruins of war, his legacy, like that of many members of the old conservative elite, is tainted by wartime collaboration.
So his daughter must confront Japan over territorial disputes, to avoid inheriting the stigma of her father’s colonial past.
The case of the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is perhaps the most complicated of the three.
His father, Xi Zhongxun, was one of the top leaders of the Communist revolution.
A guerilla leader in the war against Japan, he helped to defeat Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists in China’s civil war, became a member of the Central Committee, and then chief of propaganda, Vice Premier, and Governor of Guangdong.
An impeccable Communist career, one might think, giving his son no need to distance himself or to complete a frustrated ambition.
But Xi’s nationalism, too, has a history.
Chairman Mao’s main aim was to consolidate his revolution at home.
His nationalist credentials were so impressive that he could afford to be relatively easy on former enemies.
Territorial disputes over unimportant islands could be laid to rest.
He did not even bother to reclaim Hong Kong from the British.
It was only when Deng Xiaoping opened the door to trade with capitalist countries that anti-Japanese sentiments were deliberately stirred up.
Neither Marxism nor Maoism could be used to justify China’s joining the capitalist world.
This left an ideological vacuum, which old-fashioned nationalism soon filled.
The more the leadership opened up the Chinese economy, the more it stoked popular anger over past wrongs, especially those committed by Japan.
The man who was most responsible for Deng’s Open Door policies was none other than Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun.
Always a pragmatic Communist, the elder Xi had been the target of several purges under Mao, when relative moderates were frequently denounced as counterrevolutionaries.
His son appears to follow in this pragmatic tradition, open to business with the world.
That is why he, too, like Deng’s reformers, must burnish his nationalist credentials by standing up to Japan and asserting Chinese dominance in East Asia.
None of these leaders – Xi, Abe, or Park – wants a real war.
Much of their posturing is for domestic consumption.
One reason why they can engage in this dangerous brinkmanship is the continuing presence of the US as the regional policeman.
America’s armed forces are the buffer between the two Koreas, and between China and Japan.
The US presence allows East Asia’s rival powers to act irresponsibly.
The only thing that might change their behavior would be US withdrawal of its military force.
In that case, the three countries would have to come to terms with one another by themselves.
But that is still regarded by the Americans, Japanese, Koreans, and probably even the Chinese as too much of a risk.
As a result, the status quo is likely to persist, which means that nationalist grandstanding over conflicting territorial claims is far from over.
Abe’s Long March
TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s coalition government has decided to “reinterpret” the postwar Japanese constitution.
According to Article 9 of the constitution, drafted by American lawyers in 1946, when Japan was under Allied occupation, Japan renounces “war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.”
The new interpretation would allow Japan to use military force in support of an ally if Japanese security is under threat.
Abe chose to reinterpret the constitution because revising it would require the approval of two-thirds of the Japanese Diet.
Given that most Japanese are still allergic to military force, securing the necessary votes would have been impossible.
The reinterpretation will almost certainly result in protests from China and South Korea against resurgent Japanese militarism.
Because Abe is the nationalist grandson of a former prime minister who was once arrested as a war criminal, and because he has paid public tribute to soldiers who died for the emperor in World War II, these protests might seem reasonable.
Abe’s break with Japan’s pacifist consensus is beyond doubt.
But the circumstances under which Japan would use force are so restricted that a revival of militarism is still a very long way off.
More worrying is the effect on Japanese democracy: Elected governments do not simply change the meaning of the constitution without even bothering to get parliamentary support.
There is, however, an odd contradiction in Abe’s nationalism.
Constitutional pacifism was part of the postwar order imposed by the United States during occupation and largely supported by the Japanese people, who were tired of war.
Unlike in Germany, Japan had no Hitler or Nazi party on which to blame their wartime atrocities.
What needed to be purged instead, postwar reformers believed, was a specific form of Japanese militarism, rooted in emperor worship, the samurai tradition, authoritarian “feudalism,” and so on.
Much in the remaking of Japan after 1945 is still to be admired: democracy, women’s suffrage, land reform, freedom of speech.
But taking away Japan’s sovereign right to use military force had one major consequence: Japanese security was put almost entirely into American hands, reducing Japan to the status of a vassal state.
That is why the main goal of nationalist-minded Japanese leaders, starting with Abe’s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, has been the return of full Japanese sovereignty by revising Article 9.
That was not possible when Kishi was prime minister in the late 1950s.
The Japanese were not ready for it and Kishi was tainted by his wartime record as Minister of Munitions.
Abe’s dream is to make it happen now – and to go further.
He would like to restore some aspects of an older Japan, discredited by Japanese military behavior, such as patriotic pride, a more central role for the imperial institution, and even a reappraisal of Japan’s wartime record itself.
Hence his tributes to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the souls of imperial soldiers, including notorious war criminals, are worshipped.
Many Asians, including some Japanese, see this as a sign of new militarism.
Abe would like it to be viewed as an attempt to restore Japan’s international reputation as a “normal country.”
But Abe’s idea of normality is not yet shared by the majority of Japanese, let alone other Asians.
The contradiction in Abe’s nationalism is this: even as he talks about sovereignty regained and patriotic pride, he has done nothing to distance Japan from the postwar dominance of the US.
On the contrary, his reinterpretation of the constitution is meant to help the US in its military policing of East Asia.
In fact, what appears to be driving Abe’s endeavors even more than the desire to revise the postwar order in Japan is a widely shared fear of China’s increasing regional dominance.
A cursory glance at the Japanese press, or even the kind of books piled high in Japanese bookstores, shows just how frightened the Japanese are.
All of the talk in Tokyo is about Chinese aggression in the East and South China Seas.
Abe’s reinterpretation, then, is not really a radical departure from the postwar order at all.
China’s growing power has actually reinforced Japanese dependence on the US for its security.
Japan’s main worry is that the US may not wish to risk a war with China over territorial disputes in the East China Sea.
What is feared most, in addition to the rise of China, is the possible decline of the US.
The Japan-US alliance is an irritation to the Chinese, who would like the US to get out of the way, in order to be Asia’s dominant player.
Or so they say in public.
In fact, Chinese attitudes may be more complicated and less unified than they seem.
Indeed, China faces a rather stark choice.
Either it must live with the continued Pax Americana in Asia, for as long as it lasts, or face a more independent, nuclear-armed Japan.
Privately, many Chinese might still prefer the former.
This may seem to be the most stable solution.
In fact, it is fraught with danger.
To be sure, the US military presence still imposes a certain order with which most parties can live; but it risks dragging the world’s largest military power into petty regional conflicts, a prospect that should alarm us one century after 1914.
Reading Israel from Left to Right
NEW YORK – Israel’s current government and its supporters in the West are quick to denounce criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism.
This can be inaccurate and self-serving, but it is not always wrong.
Israel’s defenders are right to point out that public opinion in Europe, and to a much lesser extent in the United States, tends to be much more critical of Israeli atrocities in Gaza than about bloodier violence committed by Muslims against Muslims in other parts of the Middle East.
This can be explained by the fact that Israel is supported by Western governments and generously subsidized by American taxpayers.
There is not much that public outrage can do about the behavior of Iranian mullahs or Syrian thugs.
But Israel is “one of us.”
To be sure, excessive zeal in denouncing Israel, and cheap comparisons between Israeli violence and Nazi mass murder, betray a dubious urge to throw off the burdens of guilt.
After decades of feeling obliged to drop the collective European head in shame for what was done to the Jews, people can finally say with an element of glee that Jews can be murderers, too.
But, though unseemly, this is not necessarily anti-Semitic.
Anti-Zionism takes a nasty turn to anti-Semitism when it conflates Jews with Israelis – for example, when the British Liberal Democratic politician David Ward criticized “the Jews” for inflicting horrors on the Palestinians.
And, while one can be skeptical about Zionism as a historical project, to deny Israel’s right to exist is hard to distinguish from anti-Semitism.
The most sinister form of anti-Zionism is to be found among leftists who see Israel and the US as the planet’s twin evils.
Those who see dark American forces behind all that is wrong with the world, from financial crashes to the violence in Ukraine, are prone to detect the malign hand of Israeli or even Jewish lobbies in every US policy.
The link between corrupting Jewish influence and the US was originally a right-wing trope.
Jews were supposedly rootless, clannish, and omnipotent, with no loyalty to any nation.
The immigrant society of the US was seen as rootless by definition.
In the view of early-twentieth-century right-wing European nationalists, Anglo-American capitalism, controlled by Jews, undermined the sacred ties of blood and soil.
This worldview also blamed the Jews for Bolshevism, which might seem like a contradiction, but is not.
Bolshevism, like capitalism, was internationalist, at least in theory.
(Joseph Stalin was actually a Soviet nationalist who also denounced Jews as rootless cosmopolitans.)
The dangers of zealous anti-Semitic attacks on Israel are obvious.
If Israel was&nbsp;not just a fearful nation oppressing the Palestinian people, but the source of all evil, any form of violence, however destructive of self and others, could be justified.
If the Israel Defense Forces were the modern equivalent of the Nazis, it should be smashed with maximum force.
If all Jews were responsible for the oppression of Arabs, attacks on Jews in Europe, or anywhere else, should be condoned, if not actively encouraged.
The number of people in the West who really hold such beliefs is, I believe, small.
Such people exist in universities.
They write blogs.
They march together in demonstrations with some indisputably anti-Semitic Islamist militants.
But they are far from the mainstream.
Remarkably, some of Israel’s most ardent admirers are now to be found on the right – and even the far right.
Quite a few are members of political parties with a profoundly anti-Semitic provenance, such as Austria’s Freedom Party, whose early members included former Nazis.
The Freedom Party leader, along with such luminaries of the populist right as Filip Dewinter, the Flemish nationalist leader, and the Dutch demagogue Geert Wilders, have visited the West Bank and voiced their support for Israeli settlements.
This can be explained partly by antagonism against Islam.
Right-wing populists in Europe regard Islam as the greatest threat to the West.
So, naturally, they applaud the Israeli government for using harsh measures to keep the Arabs down.
As Wilders put it, the Israelis “are fighting our fight.
If Jerusalem falls, Amsterdam and New York will be next.”
But the main reason for this new solidarity between Western right-wing populists and the state of Israel might lie deeper than shared antipathy toward Islam.
No state is static, and Israel has changed a great deal since the heroic decades after its founding in 1948.
In the early years, Israel was admired by Western leftists for being a progressive state, run by Polish and Russian socialists.
Today’s Israeli leaders, however, in their rhetoric and behavior, often sound more like the old European anti-Semites.
Israeli Jews are now firmly rooted in their own national soil.
But the ruling ideology is no longer socialism; it is a form of ethnic nationalism, with a great deal of military swagger.
No wonder, then, that Israel’s current admirers have a distinctly illiberal cast.
They reflect current mainstream opinion more than leftist anti-Zionists do.
The world is increasingly fragmenting, with fearful people embracing smaller, defensive identities: Scottish, Catalan, Flemish, Sunni, Shia, Kurdish, and so on.
The idealistic internationalism of the early postwar years is collapsing fast.
Tribal feelings – national, ethnic, and religious – are filling the vacuum.
And, most ironic of all, Israel, a nation-state built by a people despised for their cosmopolitanism, has become a prime symbol of this disturbing trend.
Sorry for Nothing
NEW YORK – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is once again stirring Asia’s cauldron of national rivalries and historical resentments.
This time, he has instructed a committee of historians to reexamine the official apology delivered in 1993 to World War II-era sex slaves held in Japanese military brothels.
It is clear from various recent statements that some of Abe’s closest advisers believe that the apology was not in order, so the committee might well conclude that Japan was never officially involved in prostitution, and that its “sincere remorse” should therefore be withdrawn.
What perverse reason could Abe have for pursuing such an outcome?
Glossing over, or denying, dark chapters of national history is not unique to Japan, of course.
There is no room for Stalin’s mass murders in the kind of “patriotic” education favored by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
And the Tiananmen Square Massacre, to name but one bloody event in China’s recent past, has been officially forgotten.
Still, Japan is a democracy, with freedom of expression.
The official apology made in 1993 was prompted by a Japanese historian’s discovery of documents showing that the Imperial Japanese Army had been directly involved in setting up, though not necessarily in running, what were known as “comfort stations.”
One of the official reasons was that widespread rape of Chinese women by Japanese soldiers was provoking too much resistance among the local population.
Various means were used to stock the brothels with young women.
But, because there was no escape, the women, once ensnared in the system, were effectively slaves.
This has been officially admitted, so why reopen the ghastly business now, at a time when rescinding the apology would make Japan’s already-strained relations with China and South Korea many times worse?
If Abe and his allies were cosmopolitan in their outlook, with a deep understanding of, or concern for, other countries, the decision to revisit the 1993 apology would indeed be extraordinary.
But, as is true of many political leaders, especially on the nationalistic right, they are chauvinistic provincials whose concerns are almost entirely domestic.
In their efforts to revise the historical record, they are not really thinking of Koreans or Chinese, but of political adversaries at home.
The views of the Japanese on their country’s wartime history are deeply divided, reflecting political battle lines drawn in the immediate aftermath of the war, when Japan was under Allied occupation.
The United States, which ran the occupation, was keen to reform Japanese society in such a way that another war would be unthinkable.
Worship of the emperor was abolished, though Hirohito remained on his throne.
Education was purged of all militaristic and “feudal” elements, including favorable references to the samurai spirit.
A new pacifist constitution, written by the Americans, banned the use of armed force.
And Japan’s wartime leaders were tried in Tokyo by Allied judges for “crimes against peace” and “crimes against humanity.”
Most Japanese, heartily sick of war and military bullying, were happy to go along with all of this.
But there was always a right-wing minority that felt humiliated and resentful of the loss of national pride and, more important, national sovereignty, for Japan’s security would henceforth have to depend entirely on the protection offered by the US.
One of the main leaders of this group of disgruntled nationalists was Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s grandfather.
Kishi’s aim was to regain Japanese pride and sovereignty by revising the constitution and reviving old-fashioned patriotism, thus undoing some of the American educational reforms.
He failed, because most Japanese were still allergic to anything that smacked of militarism.
Until not long ago, there was a strong left-wing current in education and some of the media that used Japan’s horrendous wartime record as an argument against any kind of revisionism.
But, as long as the Japanese left used history to make this political argument, the nationalists pushed back by claiming that stories of wartime atrocities had been greatly exaggerated.
Books about the infamous Nanking Massacre of 1937, or the enslavement of “comfort women” in military brothels, were denounced as “historical masochism” or dismissed as “the Tokyo Trial View of History.”
The left was accused of being complicit in spreading foreign – Chinese, Korean, or American – propaganda.
This, then, is the modern Japanese version of populism: the “liberal elites,” by falsifying the history of Japan’s glorious war to “liberate Asia,” undermined the Japanese people’s moral fiber.
Because the ideological collapse of left-wing politics in Japan has been as precipitous as in much of the Western world, the so-called liberal elites have lost much of their former influence.
As a result, the voice of the nationalist right has grown louder in recent years.
That is why Abe can get away with appointing cronies to the board of NHK, the national broadcasting company, who openly claim that the military brothels were an entirely private enterprise and that the Nanking Massacre was a foreign fabrication.
Historical truth is not the point; political mastery is.
Japan’s prime minister is playing a risky game.
He is upsetting allies in Asia, embarrassing the US, and making bad relations with China even worse.
Like Putin, he is driving himself and his country into further isolation for entirely domestic reasons.
In a region increasingly dominated by Chinese power, he will be without Asian friends.
And that is where Abe’s behavior becomes truly perverse.
After all, a Japan that is isolated in Asia will be even more dependent on the US, the wartime victor, which Abe and his nationalist allies hold responsible for the postwar order that they seek to revise.
Diplomats Behaving Badly
NEW YORK – Diplomats, normally discreet figures who rarely court publicity, have been in the news a lot lately, for all the wrong reasons.
Two recent arrests of diplomats by their host countries have put a spotlight on the justification for, and limits of, the immunity from local law that such officials typically enjoy.
In the first case, Dmitri Borodin, the minister counselor at the Russian embassy in The Hague, was arrested late one night in October of last year, after neighbors alerted the Dutch police that Borodin, allegedly in a drunken state, was beating his two small children.
He was handcuffed in his own home and taken to the police station.
According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomats cannot be prosecuted according to a host country’s laws.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin immediately demanded an official apology from the Dutch government for ignoring Borodin’s diplomatic immunity.
The rabble-rousing Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky called on his followers to smash the windows of the Dutch embassy in Moscow.
A week later, a Dutch diplomat in Moscow was beaten up at his home by armed thugs (no connection between the two cases has been proved).
The timing of all of this was awkward. The Dutch king, Willem Alexander, was about to visit Russia to celebrate the two countries’ friendly relations in the so-called “Netherlands-Russia Year.”
The Dutch foreign minister duly apologized to Russia for the conduct of his country’s police, and Borodin was recalled to Moscow.
Then, in December, the New York City police arrested an Indian consular official, Devyani Khobragade, for paying a domestic worker less than the minimum wage in the United States and for falsifying the worker’s visa application.
Because consular officials do not enjoy the same degree of immunity as higher-ranking diplomats, the police were acting within their authority, even if their methods – strip-searching Khobragade, for example – might be considered excessive.
The reaction in India, however, was much fiercer than in Russia.
Outrage was voiced in the press. Apologies were demanded.
Demonstrations were held.
US diplomats were stripped of customary privileges.
Threats were made to arrest same-sex partners of US diplomats, because Indian law criminalizes homosexuality.
All of this might seem over the top and childish.
But, because diplomats are their countries’ official representatives abroad, their symbolic function is much more important than their individual personalities.
They are like national flags: insult them, and you insult the “nation.”
And when it comes to preserving national “face,” Russia and India are perhaps touchier than most countries; Russia has always felt looked down upon by western European powers, and India is still reckoning with a legacy of colonial humiliation.
A writer for the Times of India expressed Indians’ sensitivity succinctly: “The sad truth is that India is now viewed abroad as a third-rate banana republic.”
Whether or not this is true is beside the point.
Many Indians, especially among the Delhi elite, believe it.
The behavior of the New York City police played into their deepest fears.
One of the most interesting aspects of these two diplomatic incidents is what it tells us about the new Russian and Indian elite.
Diplomats have always represented the face of their country, but their own faces have changed.
In the past, diplomats did not actually represent nation-states, but royal courts (in most monarchies this is still officially the case).
As a result, European diplomats, for example, were mostly aristocrats, who all spoke French to one another.
Diplomatic incidents often had to do with the relative status of kings and queens.
One famous incident in the late eighteenth century was Lord Macartney’s British mission to the Imperial Court of China.
Macartney refused to conform to Chinese imperial protocol by declining to kowtow to the emperor, because he was not required to do the same to his own sovereign.
This, too, was very much a case of “keeping face”: the Chinese expected tribute; the British lord insisted on the equal status of his king.
As a result, the mission broke down.
Diplomatic immunity from local prosecution was an idea that sprang directly from another incident, almost a century earlier, involving the arrest of a Russian aristocrat, Andrey Matveyev, who represented Peter the Great in London.
Matveyev was detained and roughed up by bailiffs who demanded money from him.
The Russians complained. The British apologized.
And the British parliament enacted a new law protecting diplomats from suffering similar treatment in the future.
Borodin and Khobragade are not aristocrats.
Far from it.
They represent a very different age, which one is tempted to call democratic, even if Russia today is more like a soft dictatorship.
Perhaps Borodin was just enjoying a rare night out and is normally an abstemious man, but his thuggish behavior is perhaps not entirely atypical of a new class of Russians that has accumulated a great deal of money and power since the Soviet Union collapsed.
Khobragade’s case is more interesting.
She was born into the Dalit caste, the “untouchables,” who in former times would never have gotten anywhere near the elite, except to sweep their floors.
Since Indian independence, the government has done much to improve the Dalits’ status, and the deputy consul general is one of the beneficiaries of this policy.
She is a member of the new Indian elite, increasingly wealthy and proud to represent a rising power in the world.
If the allegations that Khobragade systematically underpaid her domestic worker are true, this shows how fully she has adopted the customs of the class to which she has risen.
In all the Indian protests about the terrible blow dealt by the Americans to Indian self-esteem, only a few mentioned the habitual exploitation of the poorer classes.
As with their politicians, a country’s people, it seems, often have the diplomats they deserve.
Getting Globalization Right
OXFORD – Recent evidence suggests that much of the world has entered a period of low financial-market volatility.
But this is no time for complacency; more turbulent times are likely to lie ahead.
Over the last quarter-century, rapid technology-driven globalization – characterized by the physical and virtual integration of the global economy, including the opening of world markets – has contributed to the fastest increase in incomes and population in history.
But, while globalization has created unprecedented opportunity, it has also unleashed a new form of systemic risk – one that threatens to devastate political institutions and national economies.
Systemic risk is intrinsic to globalization.
Greater openness and integration necessarily increase the potential for cascading crises and amplification of shocks.
As individuals and societies become richer, they come into closer contact with one another – virtually, through communication technologies, and physically, through population growth, urbanization, and travel.
Meanwhile, rising consumption of products like food, energy, and medicine enhances the externalities, or spillover effects, of individual choices, with the connectivity of global systems increasing these effects’ range and impact.
For example, taking an antibiotic may be a rational individual decision.
But when billions of people take antibiotics, and livestock producers use them to boost efficiency, they often become ineffective.
The same paradox applies to energy use, owing to the destructive impact of large-scale carbon emissions.
Even the consumption of basic necessities like food (production of which can have major environmental consequences) and water (given limited supplies) is not exempt.
Furthermore, increased openness and market integration, driven by rapid technological change, is exacerbating divisions within and among societies.
Those who miss the globalization train at the start often are unable to catch up later.
Nowadays, the world’s most pressing challenges – from climate change to cyber-crime – increasingly transcend national borders, making them extremely difficult to address effectively.
Worse, they can have a cascading effect, with, say, a pandemic or cyber-attack provoking a financial or political crisis and imposing costs disproportionately on those who can least afford them.
The vectors of connectivity – such as the Internet, financial markets, airport hubs, or logistics centers – facilitate “super-spreading” of globalization’s effects, both positive and negative.
Though the systemic risks brought about by globalization cannot be eliminated, they can be mitigated, if world leaders work together and learn from past mistakes.
Unfortunately, neither appears likely.
For starters, national politics in key countries is largely moving away from cooperation, with rising inequality and social fragmentation making it difficult for governments, especially in democracies, to make tough decisions.
At the same time, populations are rejecting regional and global institutions.
Europe, for example, is witnessing an upsurge in support for nationalist parties, like Britain’s UK Independence Party, and increasingly loud calls for self-determination, such as in Scotland and Catalonia.
Equally problematic, the world has largely failed to learn from globalization’s most obvious and far-reaching consequence yet: the 2008 financial crisis.
While it is impossible to safeguard the system fully, sound regulation and effective oversight could have prevented the crisis, or at least reduced its impact on millions of people’s livelihoods.
The problem was that central banks, finance ministries, and multilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund – the pillars of the global economy’s institutional framework – failed to grasp globalization’s emerging characteristics and effects, owing partly to the difficulty of discerning structural shifts in the huge mass of data now available.
In this sense, the crisis should have served as a wake-up call, spurring the financial sector, policymakers, and multilateral organizations to take action to enhance systemic stability.
But, despite employing tens of thousands of highly educated economists whose primary job is to determine how best to protect the financial system from globalization’s destabilizing effects, these institutions seem to be even less willing to act now than they were before the crisis.
This is particularly true in the advanced economies, where depleted financial reserves and political paralysis are preventing constructive investments in areas like infrastructure and education, which can enable citizens to take advantage of globalization’s benefits.
Making matters worse, some of these countries have reduced their contributions and commitment to the reform of regional and global institutions, which are essential to managing systemic risks.
In this context, it is not surprising that ordinary citizens feel uncertain about the future and frustrated with their governments, which have so far failed to protect them from globalization’s fallout.
But wresting power back from regional and international institutions – however shadowy and distant they may seem – would only compound the problem, for it would reduce the ability to guide the supranational trends that are shaping the world’s future. More, not less, cooperation is necessary to manage growing complexity and integration.
It is time for our leaders to recognize new systemic risks and work together to mitigate them.
Otherwise, the recent past will be prologue, with those risks likely to get the better of the global economy.
If Fish Could Scream
PRINCETON – When I was a child, my father used to take me for walks, often along a river or by the sea.
We would pass people fishing, perhaps reeling in their lines with struggling fish hooked at the end of them.
Once I saw a man take a small fish out of a bucket and impale it, still wriggling, on an empty hook to use as bait.
Another time, when our path took us by a tranquil stream, I saw a man sitting and watching his line, seemingly at peace with the world, while next to him, fish he had already caught were flapping helplessly and gasping in the air.
My father told me that he could not understand how anyone could enjoy an afternoon spent taking fish out of the water and letting them die slowly.
These childhood memories flooded back when I read Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish, a breakthrough report released last month on fishcount.org.uk.
In most of the world, it is accepted that if animals are to be killed for food, they should be killed without suffering.
Regulations for slaughter generally require that animals be rendered instantly unconscious before they are killed, or death should be brought about instantaneously, or, in the case of ritual slaughter, as close to instantaneously as the religious doctrine allows.
Not for fish.
There is no humane slaughter requirement for wild fish caught and killed at sea, nor, in most places, for farmed fish.
Fish caught in nets by trawlers are dumped on board the ship and allowed to suffocate.
Impaling live bait on hooks is a common commercial practice: long-line fishing, for example, uses hundreds or even thousands of hooks on a single line that may be 50-100 kilometers long.
When fish take the bait, they are likely to remain caught for many hours before the line is hauled in.
Likewise, commercial fishing frequently depends on gill nets – walls of fine netting in which fish become snared, often by the gills.
They may suffocate in the net, because, with their gills constricted, they cannot breathe.
If not, they may remain trapped for many hours before the nets are pulled in.
The most startling revelation in the report, however, is the staggering number of fish on which humans inflict these deaths.
By using the reported tonnages of the various species of fish caught, and dividing by the estimated average weight for each species, Alison Mood, the report’s author, has put together what may well be the first-ever systematic estimate of the size of the annual global capture of wild fish.
It is, she calculates, in the order of one trillion, although it could be as high as 2.7 trillion.
To put this in perspective, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 60 billion animals are killed each year for human consumption – the equivalent of about nine animals for each human being on the planet.
If we take Mood’s lower estimate of one trillion, the comparable figure for fish is 150.
This does not include billions of fish caught illegally nor unwanted fish accidentally caught and discarded, nor does it count fish impaled on hooks as bait.
Many of these fish are consumed indirectly – ground up and fed to factory-farmed chicken or fish.
A typical salmon farm churns through 3-4 kilograms of wild fish for every kilogram of salmon that it produces.
Let’s assume that all this fishing is sustainable, though of course it is not.
It would then be reassuring to believe that killing on such a vast scale does not matter, because fish do not feel pain.
But the nervous systems of fish are sufficiently similar to those of birds and mammals to suggest that they do.
When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behavior may last several hours. (It is a myth that fish have short memories.)
Fish learn to avoid unpleasant experiences, like electric shocks. And painkillers reduce the symptoms of pain that they would otherwise show.
Victoria Braithwaite, a professor of fisheries and biology at Pennsylvania State University, has probably spent more time investigating this issue than any other scientist.
Her recent book Do Fish Feel Pain? shows that fish are not only capable of feeling pain, but also are a lot smarter than most people believe.
Last year, a scientific panel to the European Union concluded that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that fish do feel pain.
Why are fish the forgotten victims on our plate?
Is it because they are cold-blooded and covered in scales?
Is it because they cannot give voice to their pain?
Whatever the explanation, the evidence is now accumulating that commercial fishing inflicts an unimaginable amount of pain and suffering.
We need to learn how to capture and kill wild fish humanely – or, if that is not possible, to find less cruel and more sustainable alternatives to eating them.
Ignorance Today
NEW YORK – Ignorance is the root of all evil, according to Plato, who also famously gave us a still-current definition of its opposite: knowledge.
For Plato, knowledge is “justified true belief.”
That definition is worthy of consideration as we reflect on the perils of ignorance in the twenty-first century.
Plato thought that three conditions must be met in order for us to “know” something: the notion in question must actually be true; we must believe it (because if we do not believe something that is true, we can hardly claim that we know it); and, most subtly, it must be justifiable – there must be reasons why we believe the notion to be true.
Consider something that we all think we know: the earth is (approximately) round.
This is as true as astronomical facts get, particularly because we have sent artificial satellites into orbit and seen that our planet is indeed roundish.
Most of us (except for a lunatic fringe of flat-earthers) also believe this to be the case.
What about the justification of that belief?
How would you answer if someone asked you why you believe that the earth is round?
The obvious place to begin would be to point to the aforementioned satellite images, but then our skeptical interlocutor could reasonably ask if you know how those images were obtained.
Unless you are an expert on space engineering and imaging software, you may have some trouble at that point.
Of course, you could fall back on more traditional reasons to believe in a round earth, like the fact that our planet projects a round-looking shadow on the moon during eclipses.
Naturally, you would have to be in a position to explain – if challenged – what an eclipse is and how you know that.
You see where this could easily go: if we push far enough, most of us do not actually know, in the Platonic sense, much of anything.
In other words, we are far more ignorant than we realize.
Socrates, Plato’s teacher, famously goaded the Athenian authorities by maintaining that he was wiser than the Oracle at Delphi, who claimed to be the wisest, because he, unlike most people (including the Athenian authorities), knew that he did not know anything.
Whether Socrates’ humility was sincere or a secret joke at the expense of the powers that be (before said powers put him to death after tiring of his irreverence), the point is that the beginning of wisdom lies in the recognition of how little we really know.
Which brings me to the paradox of ignorance in our era: on the one hand, we are constantly bombarded by expert opinion, by all sorts of people – with or without Ph.D. after their name – who tell us exactly what to think (though rarely why we should think it).
On the other hand, most of us are woefully inadequate to practice the venerable and vital art of baloney detection (or, more politely, critical thinking), which is so necessary in modern society.
You can think of the paradox in another way: we live in an era when knowledge – in the sense of information – is constantly available in real time through computers, smart phones, electronic tablets, and book readers.
And yet we still lack the basic skills of reflecting on such information, of sifting through the dirt to find the worthy nuggets.
We are ignorant masses awash in information.
Of course, it may be that humanity has always been short on critical thinking.
That’s why we keep allowing ourselves to be talked into supporting unjust wars (not to mention actually dying in them), or voting for people whose main job seems to be to amass as much wealth for the rich as they can get away with.
It is also why so many people are duped by exceedingly costly sugar pills sold to them by homeopathic “doctors,” and why we follow the advice of celebrities (rather than real doctors) about whether to vaccinate our kids.
But the need for critical thinking has never been as pressing as in the Internet era.
At least in developed countries – but increasingly in underdeveloped ones as well – the problem is no longer one of access to information, but of the lack of ability to process and make sense of that information.
Unfortunately, colleges, high schools, and even elementary schools are unlikely to mandate introductory courses in critical thinking on their own.
Education has increasingly been transformed into a commodity system, in which the “customers” (formerly students) are kept happy with personalized curricula while being prepared for the job market (rather than being prepared to be responsible human beings and citizens).
This can and must change, but it requires a grassroots movement that uses blogs, online magazines and newspapers, book clubs and meet-up clubs, and anything else that might work to promote educational opportunities to develop critical-thinking skills.
After all, we do know that it is our future.
Ignoring the Storm
The most recent G7 finance ministers’ meeting in October was an utter failure.
The only thing that they agreed on was to admonish China to revalue its currency.
The yuan’s value, while important, is not the central question facing the world economy today.
The real immediate problem concerns what is happening and what will happen to the dollar.
But the real issue for prosperity concerns the foundations of the global financial system.
How low will the dollar go?
How can we undo the imbalances of economies – China, followed far behind by Europe – exporting massively to the United States or to the dollar zone?
Will the US mortgage market, which is expected to become even more difficult in 2008, subside into calm afterwards, or will it contaminate the whole international financial system?
Is there a risk that rising oil prices – already reaching all-time highs – will cause further debt defaults worldwide?
The spate of earning reports from America’s biggest banks suggests that there are real worries here.
The condition of the world economy nowadays is very strange.
There are no great shocks but various declines and crises.
Central bankers try to soothe and reassure, but they are not very convincing.
Governments are silent, acting more or less as if nothing important is happening.
And, according to many economists, commentators, and journalists, today’s worries are temporary, solvable difficulties.
There is no general crisis on the horizon.
I disagree.
I believe that we have entered a period of weakening across the different parts of the global economic system, and that this may lead to a global recession.
This weakening calls for a strong international public response, including tighter regulation, if we are to avoid such a crisis.
Why does the world economy look so flimsy?
First, the way capitalism operates nowadays has changed mightily from just 30 years ago.
In developed countries from 1945 to 1975, capitalism brought rapid growth, an average of 5% per year for long periods.
Of course, it was subject to ups and downs, but it was not subject to financial crises of the type that we see regularly today.
Moreover, capitalism in the post-WWII decades maintained full employment, with unemployment often hovering around 2% in Europe, North America, and Japan.
Job insecurity back then was mostly unknown and mass poverty had disappeared.
The keys to that period of growth and happiness were a strong social welfare system and mainly Keynesian domestic and foreign economic policies in all the world’s big states.
Above all, every developed economy pursued policies designed to provide high wages, which would guarantee high consumption and thus rapid growth.
Shareholders used to put up with relatively meager dividends compared to today.
Thirty years on, shareholders have broken definitively with this system.
Pension, investment, and hedge funds have taken the lead in this revolution.
In all developed economies, profits have leaped spectacularly in the past 25 years, by between 8% and 10% of GDP.
But wages and social security revenues have suffered an equivalent cut.
As a result, growth has weak underpinnings.
Everywhere, labor is becoming insecure and mass poverty has reappeared in developed countries.
As economic deregulation increased, financial crises began erupting: since 1990, there have been three distinct crises in Latin America, one each in Russia and Asia, the Internet bubble, and now the sub-prime crisis.
Second, over the past 6-7 years, strong GDP growth in the US and Great Britain has been offset by staggering debt.
The US now borrows $2 billion a day, 95% of it from Asia and 45% of that amount from China’s central bank.
America’s total debt exceeds 39 trillion dollars, or roughly 3.5 times US GDP.
This situation will remain manageable only if oil prices stop increasing.
And yet, the opposite is more likely, with domestic inflation – a danger aggravated by central banks’ loosening of money supply to help commercial banks – bringing the threat of higher interest rates.
Finally, while assets nowadays are much more liquid, this has not boosted long-term productive investment.
Instead, the profitable carving up of healthy companies has freed up capital to flow to intangible assets, houses and other forms of real estate, fueling a speculative crisis.
In short, the global economy – replete with get-rich-quick schemes, overpaid bosses, and corporate fraud – has lost its moral bearings.
We cannot let those dangerous trends continue unchecked.
We are obviously sailing toward the rocks, and the whole developed world should be concerned.
There is an urgent need for a global conference – a Bretton Woods II – to adopt strict rules to contain today’s wayward financial markets.
Unfortunately, as the most recent G7 meeting showed, the world’s major governments are not yet ready to act.
Illiberal Democracy in Latin America
SANTIAGO – In an influential 1997 essay, Fareed Zakaria coined the term “illiberal democracy” to describe those countries that hold elections (of varying fairness) to choose their leaders, yet restrict civil liberties and political freedom.
At the time, such practices were common mostly in Asia and Africa, with a sizeable concentration of illiberal democracies among the ex-Soviet states.
Zakaria described illiberal democracy as a “growth industry,” and he was right: in the past 15 years, it has come with full force to Latin America.
This might seem surprising, because most countries south of the Río Bravo (known to North Americans as the Rio Grande) moved from right-wing dictatorship to democracy in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Some of these democracies were initially imperfect, to be sure, but optimists hoped that it was only a matter of time until all elections would be fair and restrictions on civil liberties fully lifted.
That was not to be.
On the contrary, the quality of democracy has deteriorated sharply in several countries in the region.
Venezuela’s late president, Hugo Chávez, was the chief exponent of this trend.
According to the democracy watchdog Freedom House, in the 2012 election, “the opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, was able to hold rallies and engage in traditional forms of campaigning.”
But “Chávez benefited from massive use of state resources that enabled him to dominate media time by a margin of 25-to-1, distribute household goods to constituents, and convince many voters that the state could punish them for casting a ballot for the opposition.”
Much the same – along with accusations of widespread vote-counting irregularities – could be said about the recent election held after Chávez died, which installed his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro.
Press freedom is also on the decline.
In another report, Freedom House notes that the number of Latin American countries classified as “not free” when it comes to the media has risen to its highest level since 1989.
The report highlights deterioration in Paraguay (where a “parliamentary coup” removed an elected president) and Ecuador, where President Rafael Correa’s government withdrew “official advertising from privately-owned media that are critical of the government” and “placed limitations on media coverage of electoral campaigns.”
He has also engaged in “legal and regulatory harassment, and physical intimidation of journalists.”
Argentina is another country where journalists are on the defensive.
A 2009 law that aimed to diversify media ownership has been used to put pressure on media outlets that are critical of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
Fernández’s supporters in Congress recently attempted to limit the judiciary’s independence and pack the upper echelons of the court system, but the country’s Supreme Court struck down their law as unconstitutional.
Illiberal democratic policies and practices are present almost everywhere in Latin America: a distortive electoral system in Chile, persistent violence in Mexico and Colombia, and endemic corruption among lawmakers in Brazil all limit citizens’ ability to express their views effectively and shape policy.
But the left-wing populists influenced by Chávez – who ruled Venezuela for 14 years – have perfected a particularly illiberal practice: bending constitutional rules to allow themselves to be reelected again and again.
In Bolivia, President Evo Morales’s new 2009 constitution banned reelection to a third consecutive term, but now the Constitutional Court has allowed him to run, arguing that the Bolivian state has been “refounded.”
Morales’s previous terms, according to this reasoning, occurred in a different state and thus do not count toward current term limits.
In Ecuador, Correa used the same trick right from the start: his 2008 constitution explicitly stated that the time Correa had served as President under the previous constitution did not bar him from seeking reelection, enabling him to remain in office until 2017.
Similarly, in Nicaragua – like Ecuador, also in Venezuela’s sphere of influence – the Supreme Court decided that President Daniel Ortega can run again, even though many legal scholars believe otherwise.
In Argentina, Fernández and her late husband Néstor Kirchner have held power for 12 years combined, and it remains unclear whether she will attempt to amend the constitution in order to seek yet another term in 2015.
The phenomenon of quasi-constitutional reelection has become so widespread in Latin America that Georgetown University professor Héctor Schamis has dubbed it “the new authoritarianism” in the region.
Other elected leaders in Latin America have been curiously tolerant of these anti-democratic practices.
Speeches at regional summits can go on for hours, but hardly a word is uttered about democracy’s decay.
Capriles, who claims that victory in the post-Chávez election was stolen from him, was recently in Chile, but President Sebastián Piñera agreed to meet with him only at a private dinner, not at an official meeting in La Moneda Palace.
Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, the front-runner in the country’s upcoming presidential election in November, did not meet with Capriles at all, citing “agenda problems.”
Augusto Pinochet, Chile’s former dictator, ruled for 16 years in the name of “authoritarian democracy,” and then attempted to leave behind what he called a “protected democracy.”
Today’s would-be strongmen speak of “popular” or “Bolivarian” democracy.
Times have changed, but one thing remains the same: true democracy needs no qualifiers.
The Illusions Driving Up US Asset Prices
NEW HAVEN – Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion.
But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.
In the United States, two illusions have been important recently in financial markets.
One is the carefully nurtured perception that President-elect Donald Trump is a business genius who can apply his deal-making skills to make America great again.
The other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier – which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published.
Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.
Trump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president.
Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices.
Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).
But it is not just Trump’s proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology.
The US has never had a president like him.
Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker.
If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.
The closest we can come to Trump among former US presidents might be Calvin Coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter.
“The chief business of the American people is business,” Coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon – one of America’s wealthiest men – advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would “trickle down” in benefits to the less fortunate.
The US economy during the Coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after Coolidge stepped down, with the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression.
During the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.
Of course, history is never destiny, and Coolidge is only one observation – hardly a solid basis for a forecast.
Moreover, unlike Trump, both Coolidge and Mellon were levelheaded and temperate in their manner.
But add to the Trump effect all the attention paid to Dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion.
On November 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected, the Dow Jones average hit a new record high – and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.
That sounds like important news for Trump.
In fact, the Dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when Hillary Clinton was projected to win.
In nominal terms, the Dow is up 70% from its peak in January 2000.
On November 29, 2016, it was announced that the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I co-founded with my esteemed former colleague Karl E. Case, who died last July) reached a record high the previous September.
The previous record was set more than ten years earlier, in July 2006.
But these numbers are illusory.
The US has a national policy of overall inflation.
The US Federal Reserve has set an inflation “objective” of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator.
This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.
The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000.
A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms.
But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.
The Fed, like the world’s other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation.
A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term “inflation-targeting” began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation.
The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation – “price stability,” not zero inflation – appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession.
Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an “irrational” resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.
Many people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement.
Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it.
Irving Fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the “money illusion” in an eponymous 1928 book.
That doesn’t mean that we set new speculative-market records every day.
Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call “random walks,” with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative.
And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise.
But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.
In the US, the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records – call it Trump-squared – has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism.
For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception – one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.
Images of Scarcity
NEW HAVEN – Could the television image we’ve all seen of the Greenland ice cap crumbling into the ocean because of global warming somehow – indirectly and psychologically – be partly responsible for high oil and other commodity prices?
The usual explanation of today’s scarcity and high prices focuses on explosive growth in emerging countries, China and India in particular, whose demand for scarce resources is “insatiable.”
But psychology also matters in speculative markets, and perhaps that image of the Greenland ice disappearing makes it seem all too plausible that everything else– land, water, even fresh air – is running out too.
Let’s take a case study, the last generalized boom-bust cycle in commodity prices, which caused these prices generally to rise (more or less) from some time in the 1960’s until the 1980’s, and then generally to fall until the mid-1990’s.
Maybe images matter just as much as substance in explaining that.
The conventional “fundamental” explanation for that cycle relates it to political events.
The 1973-1974 oil crisis is said to have been due to the cutoff of oil following the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War.
The 1979-1981 oil crisis is said to reflect the cutoff in oil due to the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war.
The drop in oil prices after the mid-1980’s is said to be due to the collapse of the OPEC oil cartel.
But some economists doubt that these events tell the whole story.
Sure, there were sharp movements in oil prices corresponding to these events, but maybe there were other, even more important factors affecting general trends in oil prices.
After all, these events don’t really explain why prices of other commodities often followed that of oil.
Maybe more important than those wars in the 1970’s was that people throughout the world got worried about running out of things.
This was the time of the “great population scare,” which transformed thinking worldwide, no doubt contributing to higher commodity prices while the fear lasted.
There seemed to be some basis for this scare.
The rate of increase in the world’s population rose from 1.8% in 1951 to 2.1% in 1971.
But those were just dry statistics.
Images likely mattered more.
In 1948, the astronomer Fred Hoyle said, “Once a photograph of the Earth, taken from outside, is available – once the sheer isolation of the earth becomes plain – a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose.”
A generation later, he was proven right.
The first photograph of the earth from space came as part of the Apollo project in November 1967.
One of the Apollo astronauts, James B. Irwin, who landed on the moon in 1971, said of his view of the earth, “It was so far away…a little ball in the blackness of space.
That does something to your soul….We all came back humanitarians….We saw how fragile our planet is and yet how beautiful.
We saw how we must learn to work together, to love each other.”
Let’s not discount that statement.
That image of the earth from space had a profound psychological effect, and we all saw it.
Maybe that image was at least part of the reason why people became so worried in the 1970’s about population running ahead of resources.
The Club of Rome’s monumental book The Limits to Growth came out in 1972, with a picture of the earth on its cover.
The book, written by a team of scientists, predicted disastrous shortages and mass starvation due to population pressure.
Despite scientific critics of the Club of Rome’s methods, the public was ready to believe the dire forecast.
The great population scare led to various birth-control efforts around the world, notably to the “one-child policy” instituted in China in 1979.
Partly due to such efforts, as well as to a change in family values, the rate of growth of the world’s population, began a long decline, to 1.1% in 2005.
That gradual decline led to gradual loss of concern about limits to growth.
Commodity prices fell, too.
Today, we remain mostly unconcerned about global population growth.
But, in the last ten years or so, we have become concerned about something else: rapid world economic growth.
While it may seem that no image in the last decade was so dramatic as the first photo of the earth from space, think again.
Try searching YouTube, for example, on Greenland ice.
More generally, the Internet gives a sense of vastness to the world’s economic activity that was never available before.
The ability to communicate via e-mail to everyone in the world creates a sense of the world’s smallness relative to the abundance of people in it.
We have seen photographs of hurricane and typhoon activity due to global warming, affecting people in Louisiana or Myanmar.
We have seen devastation from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, interpreted as a sign of crowding at the coasts.
The North Pole turned into a lake for the first time in 2000.
We see aerial photos of the Aral Sea drying up.
We practically can’t buy caviar from the Caspian Sea any more.
The European Space Agency announced in September 2007 that satellite photos showed that the Northwest Passage appeared clear of ice for shipping for the first time ever, and that the Northeast Passage is almost clear.
With so many vivid images of a shrinking and damaged planet, is it really any wonder that human psychology is ripe for high commodity prices?
Imagining Recession
The world’s housing, oil, and stock markets have been plunged into turmoil in recent months.
Yet consumer confidence, capital expenditure, and hiring have yet to take a sharp hit.
Why?
Ultimately, consumer and business confidence are mostly irrational.
The psychology of the markets is dominated by the public images that we have in mind from day to day, and that form the basis of our imaginations and of the stories we tell each other.
Popular images of past disasters are part of our folklore, often buried in the dim reaches of our memory, but re-emerging to trouble us from time to time.
Like traditional myths, such graphic, shared images embody fears that are deeply entrenched in our psyche.
The images that have accompanied past episodes of market turmoil are largely absent today.
Consider the oil crisis that began in November 1973, resulting in a world stock market crash and a sharp world recession.
Vivid images have stuck in people’s minds from that episode: long lines of cars at gas stations, people riding bicycles to work, gasless Sundays and other rationing schemes.
Today, the real price of oil is nearly twice as high as it was at the peak of that crisis, but we have seen nothing like the images from 1973-5.
Mostly we are not even reminded of them.
So our confidence is not shaken, yet.
Just before the October 19, 1987, stock market crash, the biggest one-day drop in history, the image on people’s minds was the crash of 1929.
Indeed, the Wall Street Journal ran a story about it on the morning of the 1987 crash.
I know that those images contributed to the severity of the 1987 crash by encouraging people to sell, because I ran a survey of individual and institutional investors the following week.
Images of 1929 – of financiers leaping from buildings, unemployed men sleeping on park benches, long lines at soup kitchens, and impoverished boys selling apples on the street – are not on our minds now.
The 1929 crash just does not seem relevant to most people today, probably because we survived the 1987 and 2000 crashes with few ill effects, while 1929 seems not only the distant past, but another world.
But images of the 1987 crash, driven by computers in tall modern steel-and-glass office buildings, do seem to be on people’s minds today.
The stock market suffered one of its biggest one-day drops this year on the 20th anniversary of the 1987 crash, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 2.56%.
No previous anniversary of the 1987 crash showed any such drop.
The image of a bank run, of long lines of angry people lining up outside a failed bank, was briefly on our minds after the Northern Rock failure in Britain.
But the Bank of England’s direct intervention prevented these images from gaining a foothold on our collective psychology.
The images that are uppermost in our minds are of a housing crisis.
We imagine residential streets with one “for sale” sign after another.
Worse, there are images of foreclosures, of families being evicted from their homes, their furniture and belongings on the street.
If home prices continue to decline in the United States and possibly elsewhere, there could be many more vivid images.
You may yet be presented with the image of your child’s playmate moving away because his parents were thrown out in a foreclosure.
You may see a house down the street trashed by an angry owner who was foreclosed.
Such images become part of your sense of reality, and could disturb your sense of confidence and reduce your willingness to spend and support the economy.
Could such changes in psychology be big enough to tip us into a world recession?
While it is far from clear that they will, it is a possibility.
Psychology need only change enough to bring about a drop in consumption or investment growth of a percentage point or so of world GDP, and market repercussions can do the rest.
The IMF’s Euro Crisis
OXFORD – Over the last few decades, the International Monetary Fund has learned six important lessons about how to manage government debt crises.
In its response to the crisis in Greece, however, each of these lessons has been ignored.
The Fund’s participation in the effort to rescue the eurozone may have raised its profile and gained it favor in Europe.
But its failure, and the failure of its European shareholders, to adhere to its own best practices may eventually prove to have been a fatal misstep.
One key lesson ignored in the Greece debacle is that when a bailout becomes necessary, it should be done once and definitively.
The IMF learned this in 1997, when an inadequate bailout of South Korea forced a second round of negotiations.
In Greece, the problem is even worse, as the €86 billion ($94 billion) plan now under discussion follows a €110 billion bailout in 2010 and a €130 billion rescue in 2012.
The IMF is, on its own, highly constrained.
Its loans are limited to a multiple of a country’s contributions to its capital, and by this measure its loans to Greece are higher than any in its history.
Eurozone governments, however, face no such constraints, and were thus free to put in place a program that would have been sustainable.
Another lesson that was ignored is not to bail out the banks.
The IMF learned this the hard way in the 1980s, when it transferred bad bank loans to Latin American governments onto its own books and those of other governments.
In Greece, bad loans issued by French and German banks were moved onto the public books, transferring the exposure not only to European taxpayers, but to the entire membership of the IMF.
The third lesson that the IMF was unable to apply in Greece is that austerity often leads to a vicious cycle, as spending cuts cause the economy to contract far more than it would have otherwise.
Because the IMF lends money on a short-term basis, there was an incentive to ignore the effects of austerity in order to arrive at growth projections that imply an ability to repay.
Meanwhile, the other eurozone members, seeking to justify less financing, also found it convenient to overlook the calamitous impact of austerity.
Fourth, the IMF has learned that reforms are most likely to be implemented when they are few in number and carefully focused.
When a country requires assistance, it is tempting for lenders to insist on a long list of reforms.
But a crisis-wracked government will struggle to manage multiple demands.
In Greece, the IMF, together with its European partners, required the government not just to cut expenditures, but to undertake far-reaching tax, pension, judicial, and labor-market reforms.
And, although the most urgently needed measures will not have an immediate effect on Greece’s finances, the IMF has little choice but to emphasize the short-term spending cuts that boost the chances of being repaid – even when that makes longer-term reforms more difficult to enact.
A fifth lesson is that reforms are unlikely to succeed unless the government is committed to seeing them through.
Conditions perceived to be imposed from abroad will almost certainly fail.
In the case of Greece, domestic political considerations caused European governments to make a show of holding the government’s feet to the fire.
The IMF, too, sought to demonstrate that it was being as tough with Greece as it has been on Brazil, Indonesia, and Zambia – even if doing so was ultimately counterproductive.
The sixth lesson the IMF has swept aside is that bailing out countries that do not fully control their currencies carries additional risks.
As the Fund learned in Argentina and West Africa, such countries lack one of the easiest ways to adjust to a debt crisis: devaluation.
Having failed to forewarn Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain about the perils of joining a currency bloc, the IMF should have considered whether it was proper or necessary for it to intervene at all in the eurozone crisis.
Its rationale for doing so highlights the risks associated with its decision.
The most obvious reason for the IMF’s actions is that Europe was failing to address its own problems, and had the power and influence to drag in the Fund.
The IMF’s managing director has always been a European, and European countries enjoy a disproportionate share of the votes on the IMF’s board.
Equally important, however, is the fact that the IMF made its decision while facing an existential crisis.
Historically, the biggest threat to the IMF has been irrelevance.
It was almost made redundant in the 1970s, when the US floated the dollar, only to be saved in 1982 by the Mexican debt crisis, which propelled it into the role of global financial lifeguard.
A decade later, the IMF’s relevance had started to wane again, but was revived by its role in the transformation of the former Soviet-bloc economies.
At the time of the euro crisis, the Fund was floundering once more in the aftermath of the East Asian crisis, as its fee-paying clients did anything they could to avoid turning to it.
The IMF’s participation in the eurozone crisis has now given powerful emerging economies another reason to be disenchanted.
After the US stymied their demands for a greater say within the Fund, they now find that the organization has been doing Europe’s bidding.
It will be difficult for the IMF to regain the trust of these increasingly prominent members.
Unless the US and the EU relinquish their grip, the Fund’s latest bid for relevance may well turn out to be its last.
The IMF Still Misunderstands the Euro Crisis
WASHINGTON, DC – In July, the International Monetary Fund’s Independent Evaluation Office released a major report on how the Fund handled the euro crisis after 2010.
The IEO report is critical of Fund behavior; but, as with previous IMF self-evaluations, it misses many substantive issues.
Specifically, the IEO argues that the Fund was captive to European interests – hardly surprising, given that Europeans constitute one-third of the Fund’s executive board.
Moreover, the Fund was mistaken in assuming that “Europe is different,” and that “sudden stops could not happen within the euro area.”
In a financial crisis, authorities must act fast to address the problems that caused it and restore confidence.
The United States government did just that in the fall of 2008; European leaders, meanwhile, dithered – a point the IEO neglects to mention.
The IEO report also doesn’t assess IMF programs’ effectiveness.
Consider Greece, where the Fund’s response was clearly insufficient.
In 2009, the Greek budget deficit was 15% of GDP; with an IMF program, the deficit fell in 2010, but only to 11% of GDP.
Meanwhile, the three Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – carried out budget tightening of 9% of GDP in 2009.
The Fund and the European Union have long been oblivious to many EU countries’ excessive fiscal burdens.
The Fund was lenient toward Greece because Greece is a eurozone member; but this favoritism was unjustified and ultimately costly.
Greek public expenditures have fluctuated between 50% and 59% of GDP since 2010, creating a massive debt overhang and hindering growth.
By comparison, Germany and the United Kingdom have kept public expenditures at a reasonable 44% of GDP.
The IEO report ignores this and focuses instead on the need to restructure public debt, in order to make it sustainable.
But this didn’t necessarily apply to Greece in 2009, when its public debt was high – at 127% of GDP – but not unsustainable.
Greek debt surged and became insurmountable only under the IMF’s financing plan concluded in May 2010.
At the end of 2015, Italy’s public debt was 133% of GDP, and the ratio for Portugal was 129%. Should Italy and Portugal now be forced to restructure their debt, too?
The European economy grows slowly because it is overtaxed and overregulated.
Rather than being told to restructure debt, European countries should be told to deregulate markets for labor, products, and services; and southern countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal should be told to expand secondary education and vocational training.
As the Baltic example shows, quicker fiscal adjustments can drive structural changes.
Instead, policymakers miss the forest for the trees, as the IEO report shows.
Any accounting of European economic oversight in recent years should ask why the Greek crisis erupted in the spring of 2010, almost two years after the global financial crisis.
The answer is that when the European Central Bank flooded eurozone countries with cheap liquidity, governments dispensed with serious reforms and splurged instead.
This was partly because, in the fall of 2008, the G20 and the Fund issued desperate appeals for debt-financed fiscal stimulus.
Many European countries heeded the call; but, rather than stimulating economic growth, deficit spending jeopardized several countries’ financial stability.
Before it was all over, at least eight of the then 27 EU member states required IMF financing and restructuring programs.
The obvious lesson should have been that fiscal expansion does not stimulate economic growth when there is financial instability.
But the IMF, blinkered by its Keynesian orthodoxy, still refuses to acknowledge this fact.
Many EU countries were vulnerable because they had accumulated excessive and unnecessary public debts by maintaining budget deficits during the pre-crisis boom years.
By the end of 2007, the average public debt in the eurozone was 65% of GDP, five points above the ceiling set in the Maastricht treaty for countries seeking eurozone membership.
This partly reflected the decision by France, Germany, and Italy in 2003 to violate and later “reform” the Maastricht rules, effectively declaring them null and void.
The IMF did not object to these countries’ flouting of the public debt rules.
In fact, if one compares the Fund’s own positions with that of its internal watchdog, they are strikingly similar, raising doubts about the IEO’s independence in writing its report.
The IMF and the IEO both ignore the same central problems in the official response to the euro crisis so far.
A financial crisis should be met with swift action, and budget deficits should be slashed instantly, mainly through spending cuts.
Rapid fiscal adjustments drive structural reforms, which lead to faster economic growth.
The IMF’s acronym used to stand informally for “It’s Mostly Fiscal.”
Following its inadequate response to the euro crisis, the Fund should admit that the time has come to return to its roots.
The Fund that Cried Wolf?
LONDON – If you ask Google to find the text of the International Monetary Fund’s Global Financial Stability Report for April 2006, it helpfully asks whether you are really looking for the April 2016 version.
I am sure the IMF would never seek to manipulate a search engine, but I imagine that the Fund’s public affairs officials are happy if as few people as possible can access the 2006 version.
It was not one of the IMF’s most prescient publications.
Issued just as the first doubts about the subprime mortgage market in the United States were emerging, it presented a rosy view of the present and the future.
The authors did address whether global imbalances, derivatives, and subprime mortgages posed a threat to financial stability.
But they liked what they saw.
In the mortgage market, the IMF saw prospects of a soft landing.
It believed that global imbalances would unwind gradually.
And it paid tribute to the ability of US markets and financial firms to create innovative instruments to “attract and sustain high levels of capital inflows.”
Indeed, US markets were described as “deep, flexible, sophisticated, and by and large well-regulated.”
But the most remarkable misjudgment appears in the discussion of credit risk transfer.
The IMF concluded that “a wider dispersion of credit risk has derisked the financial sector.”
As a result, “banks should become more resilient and financially stable,” the consequences of which “should be seen in fewer bank failures and more consistent credit provision.”
We have entered an era in which “commercial banks may be less vulnerable to credit or economic shocks.”
This was not, shall we say, the IMF’s finest hour.
It brings to mind John Kenneth Galbraith’s famous quip that economic forecasters were put on Earth to make astrologers look good.
So maybe we should take the IMF’s more recent reports, which are full of dark warnings, with a grain of salt.
It would not be surprising if, even a decade on, the Fund continues to be influenced by its failure to warn in good time that a global financial crisis – the worst in nearly 80 years – was a material risk.
And, indeed, there are signs that the IMF now sees trouble everywhere it looks.
But, though the Fund’s economists may be at risk of forecasting ten of the next three crises, it would be unwise to dismiss their concerns entirely on the basis of past errors.
(That has been the trivializing response of “Brexit” campaigners to warnings by the European Union, the IMF, and the OECD, that withdrawal from the EU would cause severe damage to the British economy.)
The Fund makes some strong points, but others appear much less well founded.
The IMF’s strongest arguments concern China and European banks.
It is surely true that the buildup of debt in China calls for close monitoring, and that corporate deleveraging, which is urgently required, “should be accompanied by a strengthening of banks and social safety nets, especially for displaced workers in overcapacity sectors.”
There is no reason why that cannot be achieved – the overall balance sheet of China, Inc. remains strong – but the domestic distributional consequences will require careful management.
The second big challenge that the IMF identifies – excess capacity in the eurozone banking system, and the related problem of non-performing loans – is also, in principle, solvable.
The European Central Bank is well aware of the risk from weaker banks; but, with the eurozone economy heavily reliant on bank credit, addressing it is not straightforward.
And continued massive ECB intervention in the bond markets can only postpone the day of reckoning, not avert it.
But the third problem detected by the IMF may not be a problem at all.
The Fund argues that the life insurance industry could be a future source of systemic risk, and should therefore be subject to macroprudential stress testing, or counter-cyclical capital buffers, on the model used for banks.
The first recommendation is curious: IMF staff seem unaware that a stress-testing regime for insurers has already been put in place in some jurisdictions, notably the United Kingdom.
Indeed, there are stress tests, and so-called reverse stress tests, whereby insurers are required to describe what would need to occur to make them fail.
And of course insurers did – almost universally – pass a real-world stress test in the form of the financial crisis.
The one big failure, AIG, occurred because of problems in its non-insurance business.
Likewise, the IMF’s makes no compelling case for a macroprudential countercyclical approach to insurance capital.
The Fund’s own analysis does not demonstrate that insurers behave in a procyclical way.
On the contrary, there is some evidence that they acted counter-cyclically in the crisis.
Even the IMF concludes that “the evidence is not unequivocal.”
That is a thin basis on which to propose a new set of capital requirements, which would be “built up during upswings of the financial cycle and run down during periods of financial stress.”
Why such tinkering is appropriate on the asset side of the balance sheet, while liabilities remain unchanged, is not explained.
Perhaps it would be better if the IMF’s 2006 report could be put beyond reach, behind a firewall or somewhere on the dark web, in an unindexed museum of forecasting disasters.
Then the IMF could again take a balanced view, rather than issuing so many false alarms that it is ignored when a real fire starts.
The IMF’s “Tough Choices” on Greece
ATHENS – The International Monetary Fund’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, recently asked a simple and important question: “How much of an adjustment has to be made by Greece, how much has to be made by its official creditors?”
But that raises two more questions: How much of an adjustment has Greece already made?
And have its creditors given anything at all?
In May 2010, the Greek government agreed to a fiscal adjustment equal to 16% of GDP from 2010 to 2013.
As a result, Greece moved from a primary budget deficit (which excludes interest payments on debt) of more than 10% of GDP to a primary balance last year – by far the largest such reversal in post-crisis Europe.
The IMF initially projected that Greece’s real (inflation-adjusted) GDP would contract by around 5% over the 2010-2011 period, stabilize in 2012, and grow thereafter.
In fact, real GDP fell 25%, and did not recover.
And, because nominal GDP fell in 2014 and continues to fall, the debt/GDP ratio, which was supposed to stabilize three years ago, continues to rise.
Blanchard notes that in 2012, Greece agreed “to generate enough of a primary surplus to limit its indebtedness” and to implement “a number of reforms which should lead to higher growth.”
Those so-called reforms included sharply lower public spending, minimum-wage reductions, fire-sale privatizations, an end to collective bargaining, and deep pension cuts.
Greece followed through, but the depression continued.
The IMF and Greece’s other creditors have assumed that massive fiscal contraction has only a temporary effect on economic activity, employment, and taxes, and that slashing wages, pensions, and public jobs has a magical effect on growth.
This has proved false.
Indeed, Greece’s post-2010 adjustment led to economic disaster – and the IMF’s worst predictive failure ever.
Blanchard should know better than to persist with this fiasco.
Once the link between “reform” and growth is broken – as it has been in Greece – his argument collapses.
With no path to growth, the creditors’ demand for an eventual 3.5%-of-GDP primary surplus is actually a call for more contraction, beginning with another deep slump this year.
But, rather than recognizing this reality and adjusting accordingly, Blanchard doubles down on pensions.
He writes:
“Why insist on pensions?
Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone.
Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP.
We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners.”
Note first the damning admission: apart from pensions and wages, spending has already been “cut to the bone.”
And remember: the effect of this approach on growth was negative.
So, in defiance of overwhelming evidence, the IMF now wants to target the remaining sector, pensions, where massive cuts – more than 40% in many cases – have already been made.
The new cuts being demanded would hit the poor very hard.
Pension payments now account for 16% of Greek GDP precisely because Greece’s economy is 25% smaller than it was in 2009.
Without five years of disastrous austerity, Greek GDP might be 33% higher than it is now, and pensions would be 12% of GDP rather than 16%.
The math is straightforward.
Blanchard calls on Greece’s government to offer “truly credible measures.”
Shouldn’t the IMF do likewise?
To get pensions down by one percentage point of GDP, nominal economic growth of just 4% per year for two years would suffice – with no further cuts.
Why not have “credible measures” to achieve that goal?
This brings us to Greek debt.
As everyone at the IMF knows, a debt overhang is a vast unfunded tax liability that says to investors: enter at your own risk.
At any time, your investments, profits, and hard work may be taxed away to feed the dead hand of past lenders.
The overhang is a blockade against growth.
That is why every debt crisis, sooner or later, ends in restructuring or default.
Blanchard is a pioneer in the economics of public debt.
He knows that Greece’s debt has not been sustainable at any point during the last five years, and that it is not sustainable now.
On this point, Greece and the IMF agree.
In fact, Greece has a credible debt proposal.
First, let the European Stabilization Mechanism (ESM) lend €27 billion ($30 billion), at long maturities, to retire the Greek bonds that the European Central Bank foolishly bought in 2010.
Second, use the profits on those bonds to pay off the IMF.
Third, include Greece in the ECB’s program of quantitative easing, which would let it return to the markets.
Greece would agree to fair conditions for the ESM loan.
It does not ask for one cent of additional official funding for the Greek state.
It is promising to live within its means forever, and rely on internal savings and external investment for growth – far short of what any large country, controlling its own currency, would do when facing a comparable disaster.
Blanchard insists that now is the time for “tough choices, and tough commitments to be made on both sides.”
Indeed it is.
But the Greeks have already made tough choices.
Now it is the IMF’s turn, beginning with the decision to admit that the policies it has imposed for five long years created a disaster.
For the other creditors, the toughest choice is to admit – as the IMF knows – that their Greek debts must be restructured.
New loans for failed policies – the current joint creditor proposal – is, for them, no adjustment at all.
IMF Go Home
BRUSSELS – The curtains are up on another act of the Greek debt drama.
Eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund have agreed with Greece to begin, per the IMF’s demands, providing some debt relief to the country, and to release €10.3 billion ($11.6 billion) in bailout funds.
Greece, for its part, has agreed to another round of austerity and structural reform.
Until recently, the IMF insisted that it would participate in the next Greek rescue program only if it deemed Greek debt to be sustainable.
Based on the IMF’s most recent debt sustainability analysis, that is not the case.
Germany, however, insisted that the IMF remain on board – and, with the latest deal, it seems to have prevailed, in exchange for agreeing to debt relief that it opposed.
The victory may well not have been worth the sacrifice.
In fact, it would have been better to let the IMF pull out, for two reasons. First, the IMF’s assessments of debt sustainability in Greece are undermined by a deep conflict of interest.
Second, and more important, IMF credits are too expensive.
In a normal bailout procedure, the IMF acts as an impartial judge of the troubled country’s debt sustainability; then, if it so chooses, it can step in as the lender of last resort.
This is what happened in 2010, when the private sector wanted to flee from Greece and a systemic crisis loomed.
But today Greece has only a few private-sector obligations. Eurozone governments are the ones offering large amounts of funding.
For its part, the IMF has a large volume of credits outstanding.
Of course, if Greece’s creditors accept a haircut, the IMF’s credits would become more secure – hence the conflict of interest.
Indeed, the IMF’s debt sustainability analysis can hardly be considered neutral, and would surely be rejected by private-sector actors.
A neutral judge – not one of the creditors – usually sets the terms in insolvency proceedings.
This is not to say that the IMF’s conclusion is necessarily wrong.
In fact, one could debate the question of Greece’s debt sustainability endlessly.
Some might suspect that Greece’s debt is sustainable, since the Greek government has to pay less in interest than Portugal or Italy, both of which have much lower debt levels.
The IMF, however, argues that, despite these low interest payments, the refinancing needs of Greece will surpass 15% of GDP (an arbitrary threshold, to be sure) at some point – perhaps as soon as 15 years.
What the IMF fails to highlight is that, if that happens, it will be primarily because of the IMF itself – or, more precisely, the high cost of its loans.
The IMF is charging a much higher interest rate (up to 3.9%) than the Europeans (slightly above 1%, on average), largely because it has surcharges of up to 300 basis points on its own funding costs, compared to less than 50 basis points for the European lenders.
Moreover, IMF loans are to be repaid in just 5-7 years, on average, compared to up to 50 years for the European funding.
The IMF assumes that its loans will be substituted by private-sector loans at even higher interest rates (over 6%).
This would cause Greece’s debt to snowball, given that its GDP growth is highly unlikely to achieve such a rate in the foreseeable future.
The good news is that there is a simple way to avoid this outcome: replace the IMF’s expensive short-term funding with cheap long-term European loans.
With that switch, Greek debt may well become sustainable, even by IMF standards.
Of course, this would require more funding from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s rescue fund.
But the ESM would face lower risks, because the IMF has “super-senior status,” meaning that its loans are supposed to be repaid first, anyway. (It should be noted that the most senior creditor usually charges the lowest, not the highest, interest rate, as the IMF does.)
The savings for Greece would be huge.
Given that the average surcharge on the IMF’s Greek loans is about 250 basis points, and the IMF has more than €14 billion in outstanding credits, the IMF is extracting huge profits from Greece – more than €800 million annually since 2013, nearly the equivalent of the Fund’s yearly operating costs.
The IMF is a valuable global institution, but it should not be financed mainly by Greek taxpayers (and pre-financed by eurozone taxpayers).
By sending the IMF packing today, Greece might save several billion euros over the next decade, with a commensurate reduction in risk for European creditors.
Add to that the IMF’s inability to provide impartial analysis of Greece’s debt sustainability, and it is hard to see how anyone can argue that the Fund can make a contribution to the Greek negotiations today.
There is a broader point as well.
Greece is not the only country suffering from the high cost of IMF loans.
The outstanding IMF loans held by Ireland and Portugal, which amount to another €23 billion, should also be re-financed.
If IMF loans are replaced with ESM financing, eurozone taxpayers will save hundreds of millions of euros per year.
The IMF’s participation in the rescue programs for Greece, Ireland, and Portugal has already cost taxpayers in those countries nearly €9 billion in excess charges.
While that mistake cannot be reversed, it can be rectified.
If it is handled quickly enough, some €4 billion could still be saved.
A few years ago, European bodies may not have had the expertise to manage adjustment programs without the IMF’s guidance.
That is no longer true. There is no good reason to keep the IMF around today – and there are billions of good reasons to send it home.
How the IMF Failed Greece
NEW DELHI – Democracy is about real choices.
But, throughout their country’s crisis, the Greek people have been deprived of them.
For this, the Europe Union and especially the International Monetary Fund bear considerable responsibility.
Greece was offered two stark choices: Leave the eurozone without financing, or remain and receive support at the price of further austerity.
But Greece should have been offered a third option: Leave the euro, but with generous financing.
This option should have been put on the table, recognizing that Greece has broader political reasons for staying within the eurozone.
Although exiting the monetary union would have yielded considerable benefits, “Grexit” would have entailed sizeable costs as well.
The benefits would have included a massive devaluation, which would have restored some dynamism to what was once a fast-growing economy.
But the costs were terrifying.
The government would have had to default, the banks would have been ruined, and both would have struggled for years to regain the trust of financial markets.
As a result, interest rates would have remained high for a long time to come, impeding efforts to restore growth.
Is it any wonder that the Greek government shrank from this horror and chose the “safe” option of austerity?
But this option may not be safe at all.
It is in fact, to quote T.S. Eliot, that “awful daring of a moment’s surrender...”
Greece will now need to grind away at austerity, hoping that in some distant future “internal devaluation” – that is, wage and price deflation – will help to spark a recovery.
Only the IMF could have offered the third option of an orderly exit.
Greece should have been told that it could reap the benefits of devaluation, while the international community would act to minimize the attendant costs.
The precise terms of Grexit – agreed by the troika (the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank) and Greek authorities – surely would have included a negotiated reduction in Greece’s debts, as well as a strategy for recapitalizing the banking system in order minimize uncertainty, pain, and disruption.
Still, the costs would have been sizeable, so the IMF would have needed to offer generous financing, covering the country’s import requirements for, say, two years while providing the liquidity to manage the transition to a new currency.
Of course, this would have increased the IMF’s already-large exposure to Greece; but this would have been a worthwhile trade-off, because it would have served a strategy that would have had a much better chance of success.
But is there any strategy that could have succeeded in restoring the Greek economy?
After all, under any scenario, Greece will need to run a primary surplus and undertake structural reforms to transform its economy.
And many insist that this will not happen, because Greece simply refuses to change.
And yet such assessments overlook the record of the past few years, during which successive governments have taken some fairly radical measures to strengthen Greece’s fiscal position and scale back the public payroll.
Moreover, the skeptics overlook the fact that incentives to carry out structural reforms are partly endogenous.
After all, without devaluation and the prospect of debt relief, reform merely spells more short-term pain, not less.
The reason why an assisted Grexit was never offered seems clear: Greece’s European creditors were vehemently opposed to the idea.
But it is not clear that the IMF should have placed great weight on these concerns.
Back in 2010, creditor countries were concerned about contagion to the rest of the eurozone. If Grexit had succeeded, the entire monetary union would have come under threat, because investors would have wondered whether some of the eurozone’s other highly indebted countries would have followed Greece’s lead.
But this risk is actually another argument in favor of providing Greece with the option of leaving.
There is something deeply unappealing about yoking countries together when being unyoked is more advantageous.
More recently, creditor countries have been concerned about the financial costs to member governments that have lent to Greece.
But Latin America in the 1980s showed that creditor countries stand a better chance of being repaid (in expected-value terms) when the debtor countries are actually able to grow.
In short, the IMF should not have made Europe’s concerns, about contagion or debt repayment, decisive in its decision-making.
Instead, it should have publicly pushed for the third option, which would have been a watershed, for it would have signaled that the IMF will not be driven by its powerful members to acquiesce in bad policies.
Indeed, it would have afforded the Fund an opportunity to atone for its complicity in the creditor-driven, austerity-addled misery to which Greeks have been subject for the last five years.
Above all, it would have enabled the IMF to move beyond being the instrument of status quo powers – the United States and Europe.
From an Asian perspective, by defying its European shareholders, the IMF would have gone a long way toward heralding the emergence of a new institution: a truly International Monetary Fund, in place of today’s Euro-Atlantic Monetary Fund.
All is not lost.
If the current strategy fails, the third option – assisted Grexit – remains available.
The IMF should plan for it.
The Greek people deserve some real choices in the near future.
The IMF Needs More Lagarde
DAVOS – Christine Lagarde has said she is open to serving another five-year term as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.
She should get it.
The IMF has never had better leadership, and its board of directors should give her the chance to finish the work she has begun.
When Lagarde took the helm in July 2011, she inherited an institution in crisis.
The global financial meltdown in 2008 and its economic aftershocks had discredited Western-led multilateral lenders and the free-market “Washington Consensus.”
Lagarde’s leadership has helped to restore the Fund’s reputation.
Much attention is paid to her personal qualities – and rightly so.
She is frank, forceful, warm, and engaging.
In country after country, officials with whom she has met, often under delicate circumstances, describe her as both a teller of difficult truths and a sensitive listener.
These are important qualities for the leader of an institution that must negotiate, rather than dictate, terms of agreement.
The Europeans did not like it much when Lagarde told them their banks needed to be restructured or that they needed to build a firewall to protect against financial contagion – but they did it.
Likewise, she made tough calls on providing IMF support to countries – for example, Greece, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Ukraine – that are crucial to global stability.
And there’s much more.
The Fund is not often associated with creativity and compassion.
Lagarde has begun to change that.
In the process, she has provided a human face for an institution often associated with the prescription of bitter medicine.
Helping to manage the Middle East’s refugee crisis, for example, is not an expected part of the IMF’s mandate.
Yet, under her leadership, the Fund adjusted a program so that Jordan’s government could spend more to help those displaced by conflict in Syria and Iraq (more than a million of whom are housed in camps within its borders).
Similarly, when Ebola struck West Africa in 2014, Lagarde directed the IMF to use its available cash to buy debt relief for countries in crisis, which enabled them to pay more doctors and nurses – the first-ever such use of IMF capital.
In addition, Lagarde has identified, and acted on, three of the most important challenges facing today’s world.
First, she has been both a forceful voice for the introduction of more women into the workforce and an exemplar of the value of having women in leadership positions.
In countries as different as Saudi Arabia and Japan, she has urged leaders to stop wasting so much human talent – and thereby realize their economies’ potential.
Second, under her leadership, the IMF has also addressed the broader question of income inequality.
This is not simply a question of basic fairness.
The Fund’s research has highlighted the direct link between narrowing the gap between rich and poor and higher economic growth.
The IMF is not the first to make this case, but its stature gives the issue greater prominence and urgency.
Lagarde’s personal commitment to driving home this point has been essential to advancing the argument.
Third, Lagarde has done important work in helping the world begin to understand the full implications – some of them frighteningly destabilizing – of technological change.
For example, automation will continue to make manufacturing more efficient and less costly, but it will also ensure that economic growth generates fewer jobs than in the past.
The political, economic, and social consequences of this emerging reality deserve recognition and serious study.
Lagarde has brought the IMF into the center of that work.
Critics will say that it’s time for an IMF head who represents the developing world.
Lagarde is, after all, the 11th consecutive European to hold the post, a privilege that has become hard to justify in today’s world.
Others will say that the failure to recognize the full effects of IMF-endorsed austerity on Greek citizens proves that she is out of touch with ordinary people.
Still others will argue that the charges she faces in connection with a financial scandal in France will distract her from IMF business.
After the ugly scandal surrounding Dominique Strauss-Kahn, her predecessor at the Fund, the Fund, critics will insist, can’t afford such a distraction.
Let’s take these objections one at a time.
The IMF (and the World Bank) should welcome leadership from beyond Europe and the United States.
But the purpose of ending this Western privilege is to make the leadership selection process one that is based on merit, not political considerations.
Lagarde is the best candidate for the job, and emerging powers like the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have not united behind an alternative.
The leadership of a European managing director probably facilitated the IMF’s decision late last year to add China’s renminbi to the basket of currencies underpinning its Special Drawing Rights.
In addition, Lagarde displayed impressive political dexterity in finally persuading Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress to pass governance reforms that not only bolster the IMF’s firepower to fight financial crises, but also more accurately reflect changing global economic dynamics.
The BRIC countries, for example, are now among the IMF’s top ten shareholders.
On Greece, Lagarde made some characteristically blunt – some would say clumsy –comments last year.
But she is not near the top of the list of those responsible for the economic pain endured by Greeks, and her tenure at the IMF makes abundantly clear that no managing director in history has done more to lead the Fund in efforts to alleviate the suffering of people in crisis.
Finally, the French charges against Lagarde were filed over the objection of the country’s prosecutor-general, and her involvement in the case appears tangential at best.
The world badly needs a leader dedicated to making the world a safer and more prosperous place.
Lagarde has shown that she is such a leader, committed to making the IMF fit for the twenty-first century.
She deserves the chance to finish what she started.
How to Reform the IMF Now
WASHINGTON, DC – More than four years have passed since an overwhelming majority of the membership of the International Monetary Fund agreed to a package of reforms that would double the organization’s resources and reorganize its governing structure in favor of developing countries.
But adopting the reforms requires approval by the IMF’s member countries; and, though the United States was among those that voted in favor of the measure, President Barack Obama has been unable to secure Congressional approval.
The time has come to consider alternative methods for moving the reforms forward.
The delay by the US represents a huge setback for the IMF.
It stands in the way of a restructuring of its decision-making process that would better reflect developing countries’ growing importance and dynamism.
Furthermore, with the reforms in limbo, the IMF has been forced to depend largely on loans from its members, rather than the permanent resources called for by the new measures.
These loans, meant as a temporary bridge before the reforms entered into effect, need to be reaffirmed every six months.
In our view, the best way forward would be to decouple the part of the reforms that requires ratification by the US Congress from the rest of the package.
Only one major element – the decision to move toward an all-elected Executive Board – requires an amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and thus congressional approval.
The other major element of the reform package is an increase and rebalancing of the quotas that determine each country’s voting power and financial obligation.
This change would double the IMF’s resources and provide greater voting power to developing countries.
Congress would still need to ratify the measure before the US’s own quota increased, but its approval would not be required for this part of the reform package to take effect for other countries.
The connection between the two parts of the reforms has always been unnecessary; the measures are independent, require different approval processes, and can be delivered separately.
Removing the link between them would require the support of the US administration, but not ratification by Congress.
This separation could be implemented smoothly.
A simple majority of the IMF’s Executive Board would recommend it to the Board of Governors, where a resolution separating the reforms into two parts would require 85% of the votes.
In 2010, the reform package passed with more than 95% of the votes.
The changes to the quotas could then quickly become effective.
The quotas for each member country have already been agreed, so there would be no need for further complex and time-consuming negotiations.
Countries that are willing and able to pay their quota increases would be allowed to do so, increasing the IMF’s resources and boosting their relative voting power.
The key obstacle to this proposal is the requirement of congressional approval to increase America’s quota share.
This opens the possibility that the US’s voting power could temporarily fall below the 15% threshold needed to veto decisions that require the support of 85% of IMF members’ votes.
In order to secure US support, the Board of Governors could commit not to consider any draft decision requiring 85% backing without America’s consent.
This guarantee could be included in the resolution dividing the reform package into two parts.
It would remain valid until the US was in a position to increase its quota and recover its voting share.
The Executive Board could approve an analogous commitment and request the IMF’s managing director to refrain from submitting any draft decision requiring an 85% majority without first obtaining US support.
The US administration might face criticism from Congress for accepting a measure that would temporarily cut the country’s voting share and for relying on a political agreement to preserve its veto power.
But the agreement could also act as an incentive for ratifying the reforms.
The power to reinstate the US’s formal veto power would lie entirely in the hands of Congress – making it unlikely that another four years would pass before the matter is finally resolved.
Airing the IMF’s Dirty Laundry
BERKELEY – Following the International Monetary Fund’s controversial actions in the Asian financial crisis of 1998, when it conditioned liquidity assistance to distressed countries on government belt-tightening, the IMF established an Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) to undertake arm’s-length assessments of its policies and programs.
That office has now issued a comprehensive critique of the Fund’s role in Europe’s post-2008 crisis.
Many of the IEO’s conclusions will be familiar.
IMF surveillance, intended to detect economic vulnerabilities and imbalances, was inadequate.
While staff sometimes pointed to booming credit, gaping current-account deficits, or stagnant productivity, they downplayed the implications.
Strong institutions like the European Commission and the European Central Bank had superior management skills. Monetary union, for some less-than-fully articulated reason, changed the rules of the game.
Such self-serving claims were in the interest of European officials, but why was the IMF prepared to accept them?
One answer is that European governments are large shareholders in the Fund.
Another is that the IMF is a predominantly European institution, with a European managing director, a heavily European staff, and a European culture.
The report, still on familiar ground, then goes on to criticize the Fund for acquiescing to European resistance to debt restructuring by Greece in 2010. It criticizes the IMF for setting ambitious targets for fiscal consolidation– necessary if debt restructuring was to be avoided – but underestimating austerity’s damaging economic effects.
More interestingly, the report then asks how the Fund should coordinate its operations with regional bodies like the European Commission and the ECB, the other members of the so-called Troika of Greece’s official creditors. The report rejects claims that the IMF was effectively a junior member of the Troika, insisting that all decisions were made by consensus.
But that is difficult to square with everything we know about the fateful decision not to restructure Greece’s debt.
IMF staff favored restructuring, but the European Commission and the ECB, which put up two-thirds of the money, ultimately had their way.
He who has the largest wallet speaks with the loudest voice.
In other words, there are different roads to “consensus.”
The Fund encountered the same problem in 2008, when it insisted on currency devaluation as part of an IMF-EU program for Latvia. In the end, the Fund felt compelled to defer to the EU’s opposition to devaluation, because it contributed only 20% of the funds.
The implication is that the IMF should not participate in a program to which it contributes only a minority share of the finance.
But expecting the IMF to provide majority funding implies the need to expand its financial resources.
This is something that the IEO report evidently regarded as beyond its mandate – or too sensitive – to discuss.
And was the ECB even on the right side of the table in these European debt discussions?
When negotiating with a country, the IMF ordinarily demands conditions of its government and central bank.
In its programs with Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, however, the IMF and the central bank demanded conditions of the government.
This struck more than a few people as bizarre.
It would have been better if, in 2010, the IMF had demanded of the ECB a pledge “to do whatever it takes” and a program of “outright monetary transactions,” like those ECB President Mario Draghi eventually offered two years later.
This would have addressed the contagion problem that was one basis for European officials’ resistance to a Greek debt restructuring.
One objection to imposing conditions on the ECB is that the eurozone, as a regional entity, is not an IMF member. Only countries, not regions, are entitled to draw IMF resources.
But nothing prevents the IMF from demanding policy commitments from regional bodies when lending to their member governments.
This has been done before when African and Caribbean monetary unions and central banks were involved.
Finally, the report criticizes IMF management for failing to ensure adequate involvement by the Executive Board, its oversight committee of 24 national representatives.
Board approval was sought, but only after the key decisions were already made.
Moreover, the Board was forced to act under intense time pressure and lacked the information needed to challenge management recommendations.
The IEO’s report suggests involving the Board more meaningfully, in order to provide a counterweight to political pressure from regional stakeholders.
But this merely threatens to substitute one form of political influence for another.
But this presupposes freeing the IMF from dependence on financial contributions from its regional stakeholders. And it requires IMF management to demonstrate that it can consistently make decisions based on program countries’ economic interest, not on the political preferences of powerful national shareholders.
The Inequality Trifecta
LAGUNA BEACH – There were quite a few disconnects at the recently concluded Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Among the most striking was the disparity between participants’ interest in discussions of inequality and the ongoing lack of a formal action plan for governments to address it.
This represents a profound failure of policy imagination – one that must urgently be addressed.
There is good reason for the spike in interest.
While inequality has decreased across countries, it has increased within them, in the advanced and developing worlds alike.
The process has been driven by a combination of secular and structural issues – including the changing nature of technological advancement, the rise of “winner-take-all” investment characteristics, and political systems favoring the wealthy – and has been turbocharged by cyclical forces.
In the developed world, the problem is rooted in unprecedented political polarization, which has impeded comprehensive responses and placed an excessive policy burden on central banks.
Though monetary authorities enjoy more political autonomy than other policymaking bodies, they lack the needed tools to address effectively the challenges that their countries face.
In normal times, fiscal policy would support monetary policy, including by playing a redistributive role.
But these are not normal times.
With political gridlock blocking an appropriate fiscal response – after 2008, the United States Congress did not pass an annual budget, a basic component of responsible economic governance, for five years – central banks have been forced to bolster economies artificially.
To do so, they have relied on near-zero interest rates and unconventional measures like quantitative easing to stimulate growth and job creation.
Beyond being incomplete, this approach implicitly favors the wealthy, who hold a disproportionately large share of financial assets.
Meanwhile, companies have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reduce their tax bills, including through so-called inversions, by which they move their headquarters to lower-tax jurisdictions.
As a result, most countries face a trio of inequalities – of income, wealth, and opportunity – which, left unchecked, reinforce one another, with far-reaching consequences.
Indeed, beyond this trio’s moral, social, and political implications lies a serious economic concern: instead of creating incentives for hard work and innovation, inequality begins to undermine economic dynamism, investment, employment, and prosperity.
Given that affluent households spend a smaller share of their incomes and wealth, greater inequality translates into lower overall consumption, thereby hindering the recovery of economies already burdened by inadequate aggregate demand.
Today’s high levels of inequality also impede the structural reforms needed to boost productivity, while undermining efforts to address residual pockets of excessive indebtedness.
This is a dangerous combination that erodes social cohesion, political effectiveness, current GDP growth, and future economic potential.
That is why it is so disappointing that, despite heightened awareness of inequality, the IMF/World Bank meetings – a gathering of thousands of policymakers, private-sector participants, and journalists, which included seminars on inequality in advanced countries and developing regions alike – failed to make a consequential impact on the policy agenda.
Policymakers seem convinced that the time is not right for a meaningful initiative to address inequality of income, wealth, and opportunity.
But waiting will only make the problem more difficult to resolve.
In fact, a number of steps can and should be taken to stem the rise in inequality.
In the US, for example, sustained political determination would help to close massive loopholes in estate planning and inheritance, as well as in household and corporate taxation, that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
Likewise, there is scope for removing the antiquated practice of taxing hedge and private-equity funds’ “carried interest” at a preferential rate.
The way home ownership is taxed and subsidized could be reformed more significantly, especially at the top price levels.
And a strong case has been made for raising the minimum wage.
To be sure, such measures will make only a dent in inequality, albeit an important and visible one.
In order to deepen their impact, a more comprehensive macroeconomic policy stance is needed, with the explicit goal of reinvigorating and redesigning structural-reform efforts, boosting aggregate demand, and eliminating debt overhangs.
Such an approach would reduce the enormous policy burden currently borne by central banks.
It is time for heightened global attention to inequality to translate into concerted action.
Some initiatives would tackle inequality directly; others would defuse some of the forces that drive it.
Together, they would go a long way toward mitigating a serious impediment to the economic and social wellbeing of current and future generations.
The Migration Superpowers
LONDON – We have entered the age of migration.
If all the people who live outside the country of their birth united to form their own – a republic of the rootless – it would be the fifth-largest country in the world, with a population of more than 240 million people.
Though much has been written about how a world on the move is changing national politics, there has been little consideration of its geopolitical effects.
But the mass movement of people is already creating three types of migration superpowers: new colonialists, integrators, and go-betweens.
The new colonialists call to mind the settlers from Europe who spread across the world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting not just themselves, but also their homelands.
Similarly, the most mobile populations of the twenty-first century are helping their countries of origin obtain access to markets, technology, and a political voice in the world.
The American journalist Howard W. French describes how Africa has become “China’s second continent,” as more than a million new Chinese settlers remake Sub-Saharan Africa.
With more Chinese citizens living outside mainland China than there are French people living in France, a similar story is playing out on almost every continent.
When those migrants return to China, their capabilities are expertly harvested.
Known in China as “sea turtles,” they dominate their country’s technology industry.
India, too, has a large diaspora of an estimated 20 million citizens who are super-successful and hyper-connected.
Indian-born entrepreneurs are responsible for setting up one in ten companies in Silicon Valley.
Microsoft’s chief executive is of Indian origin, as is the inventor of the Intel Pentium processor, the former chief technology officer at Motorola, and the CEO of Google.
How does this benefit India?
For starters, India receives more than $70 billion in remittances every year, the largest sum worldwide, amounting to nearly 4% of its GDP, which is more than it spends on education.
And while it may not be possible to prove a causal connection, the influx of Indians into America has coincided with a shift in both countries’ geopolitical orientations, as evidenced by the historic 2008 nuclear deal by which the US abandoned its policy of equidistance between India and Pakistan.
With so many people on the move, it is even possible to become a settler superpower without being recognized as a state.
The estimated 35 million Kurds – who regard themselves as a nation without a country – are becoming one of the most politically active migrant populations in Europe.
It is likely no coincidence that the governments of Sweden and Germany, with their large populations of Kurdish origin, are providing militarily support to the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against the Islamic State (ISIS).
The second type of superpower is the integrator.
Libraries could be filled with books about how the United States has benefited from its ability to transform people from around the world into American citizens.
Similarly, Angola and Brazil have reversed the brain drain and are receiving large flows of immigrants from their former colonial ruler, Portugal.
But the two most eye-catching experiments in integration today are Israel and ISIS.
Immigration from the diaspora is essential to Israel, which is reflected in the Hebrew word for it: aliyah, derived from the verb “to ascend.”
Indeed, the government provides “aliyah consultants,” as well as free one-way flights, language classes, and practical support.
As a result, Israel’s population has risen ninefold since the country’s founding in 1948.
In Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle, co-authored with Saul Singer, the American writer and political adviser Dan Senor poses a fundamental question.
“How is it,” he asks, “that Israel – a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources – produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom?”
The answer, of course, is immigration.
ISIS’s leaders would not be happy with the comparison, but their group’s rapid emergence on the map has drawn some lessons from Israel.
The so-called Islamic State may not be officially recognized by anyone, but it is being built on the basis of immigration.
According to the Soufan Group, roughly 30,000 people from 86 countries have traveled to ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq.
The third type of immigration superpowers are go-betweens, which use their geography to extract concessions from migration-phobic neighbors.
The most notable example is Turkey; once forced to beg to be considered for European Union membership, it now dictates the terms of its relationship with Brussels.
A leaked transcript of a recent summit with European leaders revealed how President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan threatened to bus refugees to Greece and Bulgaria if his demands were not met.
Niger is another go-between.
As a major transit hub through which 90% of all West African migrants pass on their way to Italy, Niger succeeded in securing €600 million ($680 million) in the last EU aid budget.
In doing so, it followed the example of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, who famously warned that Europe would “turn black” if it did not pay him to hold back migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean.
If the established powers that first benefited from the globalization of trade are known as the G-7, the countries, regions, and organizations that are benefiting from migration – China, India, Kurdistan, Israel, ISIS, Turkey, and Niger – could be called the M-7.
As control over population flows become a currency of power, states that follow the M-7’s lead will have the opportunity to boost their geopolitical heft.
For the West, the biggest challenge will be to reconcile domestic pressure for closed borders with the geopolitical advantages of embracing migration.
For now, at least, it seems that the G-7 – for which an easily affordable influx of refugees has somehow become a “crisis” – will continue to aid the M-7’s rise.
Immigration into the Welfare State
MUNICH – The armed conflict destabilizing some Arab countries has unleashed a huge wave of refugees headed for Europe.
About 1.1 million came to Germany alone in 2015.
At the same time, the adoption of the principle of freedom of movement within Europe has triggered massive, but largely unnoticed, intra-European migration flows.
In 2014, Germany experienced an unprecedented net inflow of 304,000 people from other EU countries, and the number was probably similar in 2015.
Some EU members, including Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, France, and the initially welcoming Denmark and Sweden, have reacted by practically suspending the Schengen Agreement and reinstating border controls.
Economists are not really surprised at this.
In the 1990s, dozens of academic papers addressed the issue of migration into welfare states, discussing many of the problems that are now becoming apparent.
I myself wrote much on the subject at the time, trying – mostly in vain – to raise awareness among policymakers.
A fundamental issue is at stake.
Welfare states are defined by the principle that those who enjoy above-average income pay more taxes and contributions than what they get back in the form of public services, while those with below-average earnings pay less than they receive.
This redistribution, channeling net public resources toward lower-income households, is a sensible correction to the market economy, a kind of insurance against life’s vicissitudes and the rigors of scarcity pricing that characterize the market economy and have little to do with equitableness.
Welfare states are fundamentally incompatible with the free movement of people between countries if the newcomers have immediate and full access to public benefits in their host countries.
In such cases, countries can act as welfare magnets, attracting many more migrants than would be economically advisable, because the newcomers receive, in addition to their wages, a migration grant in the form of public transfers.
Only if migrants received only wages could efficient self-regulation in migration be expected.
British Prime Minister David Cameron drew the right conclusion from this: Welfare magnetism not only leads to an inefficient geographical distribution of people; it also erodes and damages the magnet.
That’s why Cameron is demanding a limitation of the inclusion principle, even for intra-European economic migrants.
Even if they find a job, says Cameron, migrants should get access to tax-financed welfare benefits only after four years.
As it stands, a substantial waiting period is in force only for non-working EU migrants, who must be resident in the United Kingdom for five years to gain full access to public benefits.
The proposal does not necessarily imply hardship for EU migrants; it simply means that any support they may require over the four-year period is to be financed by their home country.
There is indeed much to be said for frontloading the home-country principle in EU rules: a migrant’s country of origin should continue to be responsible for providing social benefits for a certain number of years, until the inclusion principle is applied.
It is difficult to see why, for example, a German welfare recipient who is unfit for work should be supported by the Spanish state if he decides to live in Mallorca.
It would be equally implausible to deny this person the right to choose his place of abode just to protect the Spanish state.
If we are to take the free movement of people seriously, we should slaughter the sacred cow of immediate eligibility for host-state benefits.
This of course does not apply to economic migrants from non-EU countries, and even less to refugees.
The home-country principle would usually be impossible to apply in these cases.
But, for the same reasons outlined above, these migrants cannot be integrated by the hundreds of thousands into the welfare state without jeopardizing the system’s viability.
Therefore, the currently prevailing wage-replacement benefit system, which is applied when recipients do not work, should be replaced with a system offering wage supplements and community work.
This would lower the benefits’ net costs and weaken incentives to migrate.
Andrea Nahles, Germany’s labor minister, recently suggested as much, defending what Germans call the one-euro-jobs concept, which basically converts welfare into a wage.
That is sound advice in an otherwise chaotic state of affairs.
If freedom of movement within Europe is to be maintained – and if high inflows of non-EU citizens continue – European welfare states face a stark choice: adjust or collapse.
The Politics of Polio Eradication
CAMBRIDGE – A few years ago, the global campaign to eradicate polio seemed to have stalled.
After decades of eradication efforts, the virus remained stubbornly endemic in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.
Then, in 2013 and 2014, it was found to have returned to seven previously polio-free countries in Africa and the Middle East, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the disease’s resurgence a “public-health emergency of international concern.”
Despite this recidivism, the world today is closer than ever to eradicating polio.
In 2015, there were just 74 new cases of the disease – 80% fewer than the previous year and the lowest annual total ever.
And all of the cases were concentrated in just two countries, 54 in Pakistan and 20 in Afghanistan.
Moreover, it has been eighteen months since the virus was last detected in Africa.
The reasons behind this remarkable turnaround are instructive, illustrating the challenges facing public-health workers and the best ways to overcome them.
The barriers to polio eradication are no longer medical; the disease does not occur where vaccination programs operate unhindered.
During the past five years, polio cases have occurred almost exclusively in five conflict-affected countries: Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria.
Because immunization programs are led by national governments and the WHO, which, as a specialized agency of the United Nations, works closely with incumbent regimes, it can be difficult to carry out vaccinations in areas where militants wage war against the state.
The fall in the number of polio cases largely resulted from improved access to such areas.
In Nigeria and Pakistan, vaccination programs were able to proceed after troops asserted the state’s control over conflict-affected territory.
Most polio cases occurred in northern and eastern Nigeria, where the terrorist group Boko Haram had killed and kidnapped immunization workers, disrupting vaccination programs and leaving more than a million children unprotected.
After a regional military force pushed the group into sparsely populated mountains and forests, immunization workers were provided access to previously rebel-controlled areas.
In Pakistan, polio is concentrated in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest of the country, where the Taliban are strongest.
In 2012, militant leaders in the region banned immunization programs over concerns that they were being used to gather intelligence for drone attacks by the United States.
Consequently 1-3.5 million Pakistani children were not vaccinated.
That changed in the summer of 2014, when the Pakistan military brought large areas of the region under government control.
In the space of a single year, the number of polio cases fell from 306 to 54.
Using troops to assert control over conflict-affected areas is not the only way to improve access for polio workers, and in some cases it may not be the most effective.
In Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria, the government was either unable or unwilling to assert authority over rebel-controlled territory.
Instead, immunization workers adapted to the political reality and worked with militants to gain access to areas under their control.
The Afghan Taliban have cooperated with polio vaccination programs since the 1990s.
In most cases, local-level leaders have welcomed immunization workers, seeing vaccination programs as a form of patronage that reinforces their authority.
The few polio cases that have been detected have been either cross-border transmissions from Pakistan or have occurred in areas where intense conflict between the Taliban and the Afghan government has temporarily disrupted polio campaigns.
By contrast, in Somalia, the terrorist group al-Shabaab has historically forbidden polio workers from operating in areas under their control, viewing vaccination campaigns as part of a foreign campaign to impose a centralized government.
One million children were unvaccinated between 2010 and 2013, when a polio outbreak occurred.
Since then, immunization campaigns have improved their access to rebel-controlled areas by employing locally recruited staff to work within their own clans and negotiate access with local-level militant leaders.
In Syria, after the start of the uprising in 2011, the government prevented the WHO from operating in areas outside its control.
Over three million children were not vaccinated for polio, leading to an outbreak in rebel-controlled regions in 2013.
In response, an ad hoc coalition, including moderate opposition groups, Turkish authorities, and local NGOs carried out a series of vaccination campaigns and contained the outbreak.
The coalition negotiated access with local rebel leaders, allowing them to choose volunteer vaccinators.
Militant groups – even the so-called Islamic State – permitted immunization campaigns to operate in areas under their control.
The lesson is clear.
Successful immunization campaigns must secure the support of de facto political leaders – whether of an internationally recognized state or of a vilified militant organization.
As objectionable as working with groups like the Islamic State might be, it is important to remember that the main objective of efforts like the campaign to eradicate polio is to improve the health of people wherever they may live.
Executing Foreign Policy
NEW YORK – The filmmaker Woody Allen is often quoted as saying that “Showing up is 80% of life.”
One can quibble with the percentage, but Allen’s insight is important: You have to get in the game – be a player – to have any chance of obtaining your objectives.
The same is true of world affairs.
If showing up is 80% of life, at least 80% of foreign policy is following up.
Smart plans, good intentions, and strong negotiating skills are essential, but they are never enough – not even close.
As with business, education, and much else in life, most of what makes foreign policy work – or not – is a matter of implementation and execution.
This observation will be tested more than once in 2016 and subsequent years.
One prominent example is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the trade pact signed in October by 12 Pacific Rim countries in Asia and the Americas.
If the accord enters into force, it will expand world trade, boost economic growth, and strengthen the United States’ ties with regional allies who would otherwise be tempted to move closer to China.
The agreement’s entry into force, though, is subject to ratification by most of the 12 signatories’ legislatures.
The outcome in the US and Japan, the world’s largest and third largest economies, respectively, will be particularly consequential.
Indeed, everyone is waiting to see what happens in the US.
But approval by the US Congress is far from certain, especially as the presidential candidates –all of the Democrats and the leading Republicans – have come out against it.
The vote, if it takes place, will be close, and the stakes are high, as failure to ratify the TPP would raise fundamental questions about America’s political effectiveness and ability to be a reliable partner to its allies.
A second test will come in Syria, arguably the biggest international failure of recent years.
In December, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2254, which establishes a political framework for a civil war that has raged for nearly five years, claiming as many as 300,000 lives and creating millions of refugees.
A framework, however, is nothing more than an outline.
In this case, it was less than that, because the resolution was silent about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s political fate and the timing of his departure.
It also raised more questions than it answered about which Syrian opposition groups would participate in negotiations.
Given the many divisions both within Syria and among its neighbors, getting from the resolution to a cease-fire and political settlement is likely to take years – and even that assessment may prove to be overly optimistic.
Yet a third test for diplomats also stems from the climate agreement reached in Paris in December.
The agreement comprises voluntary pledges by governments that amount to no more than promises to do their best.
In many cases, there is a lack of specificity about what is to be done.
And, because the agreement is not legally binding on its signatories, the only sanction it permits is to “name and shame” countries that fail to deliver.
A fourth test stems from the agreement signed over the summer by the Security Council’s five permanent members, Germany, and Iran limiting Iran’s nuclear program.
There are sure to be numerous disagreements over whether the parties in general, and Iran in particular, are meeting their obligations.
Perhaps most important, steps will need to be taken to reassure Iran’s neighbors so that they are not tempted to proceed with their own nuclear programs.
At some point, the implementation challenge will include additional measures to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons once the agreement’s time limits on specified programs expire.
There are a few lessons to be learned from all of this.
For starters, while international accords are rarely reached easily, no one should get carried away at the signing ceremony.
The negotiators still must be able to deliver their governments’ full backing, and this is never automatic, especially when it comes to democracies such as the US, where different branches of government are often controlled by different political parties.
A second reality is that there is an unavoidable trade-off between negotiations and implementation.
In many cases, agreement is possible only if critical details are left unresolved.
But such “creative ambiguity” also ensures that the implementation phase will be more difficult, as tough choices that were postponed suddenly must be addressed.
Third, there will inevitably be moments when one or another party does not implement the pact in a manner judged to be adequate.
Dealing with episodes of alleged non-compliance can prove to be every bit as demanding as the original negotiation.
Which brings us back to where we began.
All four of the major international accords reached in 2015 – the TPP, the Security Council’s Syria resolution, the Paris climate agreement, and the Iran nuclear deal – required great effort to negotiate.
Making them work in 2016 and beyond will prove even harder.
As Woody Allen could tell you, it is akin to the difference between writing a screenplay and making a movie.
Europe’s Plan A
FRANKFURT – Europe’s politicians nowadays are desperately looking for someone to blame for the euro crisis.
Germany blames France, and vice versa.
Even lawyers are getting into the act, trying to identify legal responsibility for the monetary union’s design flaws.
Meanwhile, as the crisis has deepened, a new consensus about Europe’s monetary union has emerged.
The euro, according to this view, was devised in a fit of giddy and irresponsible optimism – or, alternatively, panic at the prospect of German hegemony over Europe – in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Report on economic and monetary union in the European Community, which laid out the euro blueprint, was presented in April 1989 – a time when no one (with the possible exception of some Kremlin strategists) was thinking about German reunification.
Moreover, the salient issues concerning monetary unions were well understood, and remedies for the most significant obstacles were proposed at the outset.
The committee that drafted the report – now known as the Delors Report, after its chairman, Jacques Delors – was a fundamentally rather conservative group of central bankers, with even the governor of the Bank of England (BoE) signing on.
Its internal debates highlighted two problems of the potential monetary union.
First, the committee explicitly discussed whether the capital market would suffice to impose fiscal discipline on the currency union’s members, and agreed that a system of rules was needed.
But those rules were steadily weakened, and by the early 2000’s were widely derided (including by Romano Prodi, Delors’ successor as President of the European Commission), as governments found that they could run large deficits without paying higher market interest rates.
The second problem was more serious.
In the original plan for the European Central Bank, the proposed institution would have had overall supervisory and regulatory powers.
Indeed, the drafters of the ECB statute produced an astonishingly far-sighted approach to banking supervision.
Their 1990 version of the Maastricht Treaty’s Article 25 on Prudential Supervision included the following provisions (placed in square brackets to show that they were not completely consensual): “The ECB may formulate, interpret, and implement policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit and other financial institutions for which it is designated as competent supervisory authority.”
The demand that the ECB should be the central supervisory authority in an integrated capital market met strong resistance, above all from Germany’s Bundesbank, which worried that a role in maintaining financial stability might undermine the Bank’s ability to focus on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy.
There was also bureaucratic resistance from existing regulators.
Most important, supervision suggested some potential responsibility to recapitalize problematic banks, and thus involved a fiscal cost.
The most energetic actor behind the early thinking on banking supervision was a BoE official, Brian Quinn.
But his credibility was sapped in the wake of criticism of the BoE’s handling of the collapse in 1991 of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International – an episode that anticipated later issues in managing the failure of large, cross-border institutions.
A legal vestige of the original plan may offer an easy path to a greater ECB supervisory role today.
According to Article 25 of the Maastricht Treaty, the ECB may “offer advice to and be consulted by” the Commission or the Council on the scope and implementation of legislation relating to prudential supervision.
When that phrase was inserted in the Treaty, it appeared as if the hurdles to effective European banking supervision could hardly be set higher.
The ECB was not given overall supervisory and regulatory powers.
And, until the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the connections between financial and fiscal health, no one considered that a problem.
They do now.
Nevertheless, fiscal rules and common banking supervision are still regarded in many quarters as an illegitimate encroachment on member states’ sovereignty.
After all, the European Union has avoided becoming a focus of heated contestation precisely because it never got much of a share of what Europeans produced (its budget, at just over 1% of the EU’s GDP, has barely changed in relative terms for the past 40 years).
It was the member states that did politics and budgets.
Delors had a different vision.
At the time of his report, he concluded that the European budget would amount to some 3% of GDP – identical to the peacetime US federal budget’s share of GDP during the country’s first stage of monetary union, in the nineteenth century.
Moreover, as in Europe today, when Alexander Hamilton proposed a central banking system, the Bank of the United States, alongside consolidation of states’ Revolutionary War debt into federal debt, the implementation of his sensible plan was imperfect.
In the American case, the principles of federal finance were not worked out until the Civil War, and the Federal Reserve System was established even later, coming only in 1913.
Europeans can learn from the United States and implement a fundamentally sound plan.
But they must also recognize that political backlashes and setbacks are inevitable – and thus that the road from vision to reality may be longer than expected.
National Security Babies
WASHINGTON, DC – From the emergence of the Islamic State to Russian expansionism and China’s rise, there is no shortage of national-security challenges facing the United States.
But, as a new report – Worthy Work, STILL Unlivable Wages – demonstrates, nothing poses a more potent threat to America’s future than the failure to provide adequate care and education to children under the age of five.
If young children do not receive high-quality care from educated professionals who understand how to stimulate and shape brain development, the next generation of Americans will suffer from an ever-widening achievement gap relative to their counterparts in other advanced countries and emerging competitors.
Yet Americans pay these trained professionals the same wages paid to those who park our cars, walk our dogs, flip our burgers, and mix our drinks.
The implication is clear: American children require no more nuanced attention than animals or inanimate objects.
This is a grave error.
Early childhood care can shape a person’s lifelong capacity for learning, emotional resilience, confidence, and independence.
In fact, providing high-quality care that engages and instructs children in their first five years of life has a greater impact on their development than any other intervention over the course of their lifetime.
This is not new information.
The book Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development, published more than a decade ago by the National Academy of Sciences,&nbsp;begins by acknowledging that, from conception to the first day of kindergarten, the pace of development exceeds “that of any subsequent stage of life.”
That development “is shaped by a dynamic and continuous interaction between biology and experience.”
This observation is now backed by neuroscience, which has identified how&nbsp;the brain develops over that period and has created a system for measuring learning gaps.
Such research has confirmed that building the brain is just as important as feeding the body to produce healthy, intelligent, productive, and resilient adults.
A recent study tallied the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, a North Carolina social experiment that began in the early 1970s.
The study compared two sets of disadvantaged children, with one set receiving excellent nutrition and high-quality, stimulating care for eight hours a day from birth to age five, and the other receiving ordinary formula and care.
Four decades later, the adults who had received better care were not only physically healthier; they were more than four times likelier to have a college degree.
Clearly, there is a lot more to early-childhood care than setting out juice and cookies, supervising naps, and taking kids to the playground.
According to Megan Gunnar, who specializes in the intersection of developmental psychology and neuroscience, a good early childhood caregiver “requires [the] capacity to analyze what’s happening in the moment” and determine what concept – whether a numerical concept, or one related to language or physics – the child could be learning.
Responding “in the moment, dynamically, really takes analytic skills, executive function, ordering and sequencing, and knowing a lot of information.”
Unfortunately for America’s children, the high-functioning circuits in the caregiver’s prefrontal cortex that these skills demand are directly affected by stress.
And, in the US, the vast majority of early-childhood workers are under enormous economic stress.
In 2012, almost half of all childcare workers’ families received some kind of federal public support, from food stamps to children’s health insurance.
Such economic stress does not decrease with education.
A male teacher working in the civilian labor force with a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2012 had an average annual salary of $88,000.
Early childhood educators with the same qualifications had an average annual salary of $27,000-28,000.
The exception is the US military, which pays teachers according to the same scale as other defense department employees, based on criteria like training, education, seniority, and experiences.
In other words, the segment of the US government that is directly responsible for upholding national security recognizes the need to attract and retain highly educated workers to provide care and early learning to the children of all employees.
Could this be because the military and civilian leaders of the US defense establishment have seen first-hand the costs of stunted intellectual growth, hyperactivity, and lack of impulse control?
To compete in a digital global economy, the US – indeed, any country – needs a capable, well educated, innovative, and healthy workforce.
The development of such a workforce begins at birth.
Anyone can change a diaper, but not everyone can engage, stimulate, and respond to a baby or a toddler in a way that will build neurons, much less impart skills calibrated to the child’s stage of development.
The US has the world’s most dynamic technological sector – not least because it offers the high salaries needed to attract the best talent.
You get what you pay for, and Americans are paying far too little for their children to thrive.
Impotent America?
JERUSALEM – Israel’s 60th anniversary has come and gone.
So, too, has President George W. Bush’s final visit to the Middle East.
Amidst the celebrations and the soul-searching, no meaningful breakthrough in the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is visible.
There are immediate reasons why this is so: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s government is weak and unpopular, mainly due to the botched 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is even weaker, having lost control of Gaza to Hamas after a violent putsch last year.
On the Palestinian side, this is part of a deeper phenomenon: a longstanding failure to create the institutional structures necessary for nation building.
For example, in 1936-1939, a Palestinian uprising against British rule deteriorated into a bloody civil war, in which more Palestinians were killed by their brethren than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
This is repeating itself now in Gaza.
Looking back at 60 years of American involvement in the region, one can discern two scenarios in which the United States can bring the local players to an agreement.
Absent these conditions, the US is ultimately powerless.
The first scenario is when a real war threatens to spill over into a wider conflict, destabilizing the region and Great Power relations.
At such times, resolute American steps can stop the fighting and impose a cease-fire, if not peace.
In 1973, at the end of the Yom Kippur War, Israel was poised to encircle the entire Egyptian Third Army in Sinai.
Its troops were on the road to Cairo, threatening to inflict a major defeat on Egypt.
Soviet intervention became a real threat.
A few tough messages from President Richard Nixon stopped the Israelis in their tracks and enabled the Americans to start a lengthy process of de-escalation that led to a number of interim agreements.
Likewise, in 1982, during the invasion of Lebanon, Israeli troops were about to enter Muslim West Beirut after Syrian agents assassinated the pro-Israeli Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
This would probably have brought Syria into the war.
A few tough calls from President Ronald Reagan to Prime Minister Menachem Begin prevented this.
During the first Gulf War in 1991, when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israeli civilian targets and US forces failed to stop the Iraqi attacks, Israel was set to strike Iraqi targets, which would have split the US-Arab anti-Iraq coalition.
The US warned Israel not to get involved, and Israel was forced to comply.
In all these cases, American involvement was swift and focused on a clear aim, and compliance was verifiable within days, if not hours.
In such dramatic situations, US power is at its greatest.
The other scenario is when the two sides have already engaged in bilateral peace talks, paid the domestic political price, and reached agreement on most issues, though some matters remain unresolved and threaten to derail the process.
In such cases, America can step in and, by using both carrot and stick, make both sides go the extra mile.
After Anwar Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in 1977, Israel and Egypt negotiated for a year and reached agreement on most issues: peace, diplomatic relations, and full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Egyptian territory in Sinai.
At this point, President Jimmy Carter – who initially opposed the process – invited both sides to Camp David to hammer out a peace treaty.
In 1993, in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway (unknown to the Americans), Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority.
Yet some issues remained unresolved.
President Bill Clinton stepped in, and prevailed upon the two sides to work out their remaining disagreements.
When either of these two scenarios is lacking, American initiatives are stillborn.
This happened to Clinton at Camp David in 2000, when he failed to bring Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to an agreement, and to Bush’s Road Map in 2003, when both sides agreed in principle to its general guidelines, but did little to implement them.
Absent local political will, and when confronted with a peace-making project that may take years to complete, the US is virtually powerless.
It is extremely successful as a fire brigade or as a midwife , but not as an initiator .
What applies to the US is even truer for the European Union, whose “soft power” is no match for its lack of local credibility.
The same dynamic can be seen elsewhere: for all its power, the US has failed to resolve the conflicts in Cyprus, Bosnia, or Kosovo.
The Annan Plan failed in Cyprus because of one party’s opposition; progress now (the minor but symbolically important opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia) reflects internal political changes on the Greek Cypriot side.
Similarly, if Belgrade will change its obstreperous position on Kosovo, this will be due not to US or EU pressure, but to internal political changes in Serbia.
Recognizing the limits of US power doesn’t mean that America is irrelevant: it can stabilize a conflict, help bring about confidence-building measures, and negotiate interim agreements.
But at the end of the day, in the case of Israel-Palestine, as in any conflict between two national movements, the key is in the hands of the local players.
No national conflict has ever been solved by outside powers, however well intentioned they may be.
Making Water Conservation Pay
NEW YORK – Call it a sign of the times.
Rarely a month passes in which a water crisis does not make headlines somewhere in the world.
In early August, an algal bloom in Lake Erie, the result of agricultural runoff, contaminated drinking water in Toledo, Ohio.
In September, the reservoirs in China’s Henan province dried up, leaving crops to shrivel and forcing some residents to drink from puddles on the ground.
In late October, the city of Hyderabad, India, discovered that its water supply might be diverted next year for agricultural uses upstream, leaving some eight million people to wonder where they will find the 190 million gallons of water they need every day.
City officials usually respond to such supply crises by upgrading their water infrastructure, namely, drilling, damming, and laying pipes.
Every day, the world’s largest 100 cities move 3.2 million cubic meters of water more than 5,700 kilometers to address local water shortages or problems with pollution.
But this is an expensive solution, one that only the wealthiest cities can afford.
It also puts city managers at odds with environmentalists, who campaign for restrictions on development to ease pressure on forests and watersheds.
Fortunately, it is not the only option.
Nature, it turns out, can play an important – and so far largely untapped – role in water delivery and treatment.
Protecting water at its source can be cheaper and more efficient than treating it after it has already been polluted.
In a new report, my colleagues at The Nature Conservancy, the C40 Climate Leadership Group, and the International Water Association show that investing in forest protection, reforestation, stream bank restoration, improved agricultural practices, and forest-fire management can reduce the amount of pollutants flowing into supplies of drinking water.
The report, “The Urban Water Blueprint,” analyzes the state of water supplies in 534 cities and 2,000 watersheds to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential natural solutions that can be integrated with traditional infrastructure.
The results are compelling.
Water quality for more than 700 million people could be significantly improved by adopting conservation practices in watersheds.
And at least one in four cities examined would find such interventions financially viable, based solely on savings from avoided water-treatment costs.
In some places, such measures have already been introduced.
Farmers near Beijing, for example, have been paid to convert croplands from rice to corn.
Rice paddies need to be constantly flooded, and, because they are often located on steep slopes, this leads to significant runoff of fertilizers and sediment.
Shifting to corn not only reduces water consumption; it also cuts the amount of pollution that reaches city residents downstream.
The program costs about $1,330 per hectare of farmland to implement, but produces $2,020 per hectare of benefits.
In Brazil, a water-conservation fund is working to restore the Cantareira watershed, the source of 50% of Sao Paulo’s water.
The area has lost 70% of its original forest cover, and sediment from eroding hillsides has clogged the city’s reservoir, jeopardizing the water supply of Brazil’s largest city.
Under the new program, farmers and ranchers are paid $120 per hectare to reforest or terrace their fields.
So far, about 3,500 hectares have been planted with trees or put under improved soil-management practices.
Reforesting another 14,200 hectares could cut the concentration of sediment in the watershed by half.
The savings produced by these programs should be viewed in the context of the $90 billion per year that cities spend to build treatment plants, pipes, and other components of water infrastructure.
The authors of “The Urban Water Blueprint” have calculated that more than $18 billion could be productively directed toward conservation activities, saving cities money and creating a new market comparable in size to the market for the water sector’s existing technologies.
But if these solutions are to be adopted at the necessary scale, environmentalists and city officials alike will have to expand the scope of their traditional activities.
Environmentalists will have to embrace the idea that conservation does not only mean protecting pristine landscapes.
It also sometimes requires the improvement of lands under production.
Indeed, these are the areas where some of the most cost-effective solutions are to be found.
Water quality would be improved for more than 600 million people if the farms and ranches operating within their watersheds limited runoff and restored stream banks.
City officials, meanwhile, need to think beyond their municipalities’ boundaries.
The 100 largest cities occupy much less than 1% of the planet’s land, but the watersheds on which they depend account for a full 12%.
Because many cities share water resources, cross-jurisdictional financing mechanisms and a shared sense of commitment will be needed in order to protect and restore natural sources of clean water.
These partnerships will require the cooperation of a broad variety of interest groups, all of which will have to be persuaded to support efforts to improve the water supply.
Farmers and ranchers should be at the top of the engagement list.
Land use and water security are firmly linked.
By embracing both natural and traditional water infrastructure, cities will not only secure their future water supply; they will also reshape our planet’s landscape for the better.
Health Care’s New Frontier
BEIJING – Developing countries face a seemingly insurmountable hurdle in providing health care to their rapidly growing – or, in some cases, rapidly aging – populations, especially as health systems become increasingly over-burdened and infections and other diseases spread.
Because access to medicine in these regions is a multifaceted challenge, it is best tackled by several parties.
Lasting, collaborative relationships among pharmaceutical companies, governments, nonprofit organizations, and community leaders are needed to help disadvantaged populations overcome their health-care challenges.
Together, these parties should take a binary approach, addressing both “hardware” factors (which remain constant, such as physical distance to treatment centers and elongated supply chains) and “software” factors (the intangibles that vary greatly in each region, such as the role of family and cultural beliefs).
These principles are especially true in places like China’s rural Xinjiang province, where life expectancy is stunted at 67 years (compared to 73.5 for China as a whole), and lack of access to health care undermines well-being.
Xinjiang covers nearly 650,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometers), but it is home to only 21 million people, many of whom are members of nomadic tribes.
From an economic standpoint, Xinjiang’s resilience is crucial to China’s economic growth strategy – it is seen as the country’s gateway to the west.
But the reality is that maintaining the livelihood and well-being of this area’s population and those in other rural parts of China is a serious challenge.
Throughout rural China, the spread of infectious diseases – particularly hepatitis B, which affects millions – reflects a lack of hygiene education.
The health ministry cited a 9.5% increase in deaths caused by infectious diseases from 2011 to 2012.
Moreover, there is a serious shortage of health-care workers – just 1.3 per 1,000 rural inhabitants in China.
Free medicines are only part of the solution.
We need to go beyond donations and reduced-pricing schemes to build sustainable health-care systems with strong distribution channels and education programs for the public and for health-care workers.
Without these components, the model collapses.
Through public-private partnerships, we can leverage unique strengths and be better equipped to expand access to health care.
This can create a symbiotic relationship, offering benefits to government, business, and the local community.
For example, Novartis’s Jiankang Kuaiche (“Health Express”) program in Xinjiang is a partnership between Novartis and the local government that aims to expand access to medicine, build capacity, and educate the public.
Health Express achieves this by training local physicians in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and educating primary and middle-school students on health and hygiene via a traveling caravan that moves from school to school.
During a recent trip to Xinjiang, I met several physicians from rural hospitals who had received training through Health Express.
They told me that in the past, hepatitis patients had to travel for hours to be diagnosed and treated at a city hospital, while many others who were unable to make the journey suffered without treatment.
Now, with physicians trained in infectious diseases, hepatitis treatment is possible in rural areas of Xinjiang, and patient outcomes have improved significantly.
I also met with school children at Urumqi Dengcaogou Boarding School, which is situated in a rural area outside of the provincial capital.
The students were proud to be able to bring their new health-care knowledge back to their families.
They told me how they had told their parents to quit smoking after learning about the consequences of the habit on health.
These children join more than 500,000 others in Xinjiang who have participated in the educational component of Health Express.
By targeting schools as hubs for health-care education and shaping students into health ambassadors for their families and friends, we can reach an even greater number of people in Xinjiang’s nomadic communities.
Xinjiang means “new frontier,” and right now, we are at the edge of a new frontier in delivering sustainable health-care solutions to communities where limited resources and infrastructure constrain access to health care.
These multidimensional, scalable interventions help to bridge the gaps in developing regions.
But neither corporations nor governments can do it alone.
They need to work together to achieve the best possible outcome.
We also must abandon the idea of a one-size-fits-all model for expanding access to health care and adjust our approaches to ensure the best fit with local health priorities and customs.
With education and prevention, capacity-building, and new kinds of partnerships, we can continue to improve access to health care in Xinjiang and beyond, boosting well-being throughout the developing world.
The African Breadbasket
KIGALI – On the first World Food Day in 1945, people around the world celebrated the creation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the launch of the first coordinated global action to combat hunger.
This year, on the 70th World Food Day, countries are mobilizing behind the Sustainable Development Goals – one of which calls for the elimination of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, together with the creation of a more resilient and sustainable food system.
Can it be done?
With the world population growing rapidly (to an estimated 8.5 billion by 2030), the impact of climate change becoming increasingly apparent, and the amount of arable land dwindling, there can be no denying that achieving this goal will be a daunting challenge.
But for Africa, which boasts 60% of the world’s arable land and climates conducive to a tremendous diversity of crops, striving to do so represents a remarkable opportunity to ensure food security for Africans (one in four is undernourished) and boost its economy by becoming a major food exporter.
Though many African economies have experienced rapid growth in recent years, the agricultural sector has remained stagnant.
Indeed, African agriculture is still dominated by small-scale farmers who lack access to productivity-boosting technology, focus mainly on a narrow range of products, and remain poorly linked to markets, manufacturing, and the broader economy.
Beyond undermining food security – Africa remains a major food importer – low agricultural productivity contributes to the persistence of rural poverty, even as a middle class emerges in many of Africa’s cities.
Africa can and should be the world’s breadbasket.
But to realize this vision – and to do it in an environmentally sustainable way – its agricultural sector must undergo a genuine transformation that entails higher capital investment, significant crop diversification, and improved linkages to burgeoning urban consumer markets.
Moreover, Africa must start manufacturing more value-added food products for both internal consumption and export, especially to countries like India and China, where demand is growing.
From Europe and North America to East Asia and Latin America, agricultural advances have proved to be key precursors of industrial development and gains in living standards.
Africa has the added benefit of technologies that other regions lacked at this stage of their agricultural development, from cost-competitive off-grid solar power to mechanisms for mapping soil characteristics, regulating water use, and ensuring farmers’ access to accurate price information.
And innovation is already happening.
Rwanda, for example, is working to link agriculture support with broader services like electricity and education.
And the country’s farming communities are pioneering participatory decision-making structures for agricultural planning and conflict-resolution mechanisms to settle disputes among growers.
To bolster agricultural innovation and modernization, governments must ensure that farmers have secure titles to their land, and thus an incentive to make the needed investments.
The challenge lies in the fact that, in many parts of Africa, land is communally owned, with almost everyone in a village having traditional rights to some farming land – a system that has helped to prevent landlessness and destitution in rural areas.
Given this, reforms to make land tenure more compatible with modern commercial agriculture must be sensitive to local traditions and respect the ownership rights of communities and traditional smallholders.
Of course, agricultural development can have serious economy-wide pitfalls, which must be navigated carefully.
For example, as technology-driven productivity gains reduce the number of workers needed on farms, strategies to boost employment in other parts of the value chain and to manage migration to cities become even more essential.
With Africa’s rural population already largely underemployed, there is no time to waste in implementing such strategies.
Fortunately, Africa’s large population of increasingly well-educated young people, who are largely uninterested in the backbreaking work of subsistence farming, is well suited to fill the higher value-added jobs that emerge in the agricultural sector and beyond.
Another potential pitfall of agricultural development is environmental damage, including land degradation, soil nutrient mining, excessive water use, and water pollution.
Here, again, Africa can benefit from experience and know-how that other regions could not access at a similar stage in their agricultural development.
By drawing on other countries’ best practices – and avoiding their mistakes – Africa can develop an environmentally sustainable agricultural system that fits African conditions.
Such a system must place a high priority on protecting biodiversity and prevent the emergence of monocultures across the continent, which is home to some of the world’s richest ecosystems.
Climate-change considerations – including the expected costs of mitigation and adaptation – must be central to the process of upgrading agriculture, including the relevant infrastructure.
Ultimately, each country must chart its own course toward agricultural development.
But cooperation – even just to exchange ideas and emulate best practices – can help the process considerably.
That is why, next March, the African Transformation Forum in Kigali will convene leading figures from African governments, business, academia, and civil society to discuss practical next steps toward agricultural transformation in Africa, and the broader push to build globally competitive economies.
Africa’s agricultural transformation will be a long and complex process.
But it has the potential to ensure regional food security, promote broader economic development, and ultimately help to feed the world.
We are confident that African leaders will rise to the challenge.
Breaking the Ice in the South China Sea
MANILA – Three months ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to the resources in the West Philippine Sea (also known as the South China Sea), and thus that the Philippines has exclusive rights to the territory.
China rejected the ruling, and an icy chill overcame the once-friendly bilateral relationship.
It is time to bring back some warmth.
Soon after the ruling, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte unexpectedly designated me, at age 88, to be my country’s special envoy to China, with the goal of doing just that.
Thanks to Hong Kong bankers (including my personal friend Wai Sun Ng of Jibsen Capital), my first point of contact was Fu Ying, who has served as China’s ambassador to the Philippines and as Deputy Foreign Minister.
I was fortunate to meet Fu, who is now Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress.
She not only possesses detailed knowledge of the issues surrounding the South China/West Philippine Sea, but is also well informed about Philippine culture and politics.
In our first exploratory meeting, I also made contact with the similarly knowledgeable Wu Shicun, President of China’s National Institute for South China Sea Studies.
The atmosphere at our meeting was friendly.
In their private capacities, Wu and Fu openly discussed the need to find a way forward that would ensure enduring peace and closer cooperation between China and the Philippines.
But, reflecting the deep sensitivity of the territorial issue on both sides, our meeting’s primary conclusion was that reducing tensions would require more discussions aimed at boosting trust and confidence.
Such discussions would, over time, have to address a wide range of issues.
For starters, China and the Philippines should agree on the need for marine preservation.
To avoid tensions, fishing in the West Philippine Sea should be carefully managed.
In fact, cooperation on fishing should be added to the bilateral agenda, as should joint efforts to confront drug trafficking, smuggling, and corruption.
Mutually beneficial efforts to improve tourism and encourage trade and investment, and to promote exchanges among think tanks and academic institutions on relevant issues, also hold substantial promise.
These priorities are reflected in the recommendations that I presented to Duterte.
The Philippines must, in my view, expedite the appointment and confirmation of an ambassador to China, in order to continue exploratory talks and seize opportunities to build trust and find common ground.
As we make progress on that front, we must pursue agreements on issues relating to fishing, tropical fruits, tourism, and infrastructure that support China’s maritime Silk Road initiative in and around the Philippines.
But, throughout all of this, it is vital to remember that the discussions are not just about rocks and atolls; they are about war and peace.
Just a year ago, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution – since approved by 195 UN member states – setting out a long-range strategic framework for avoiding a global armed conflict that could lead to World War III.
In our meetings with Chinese actors, my team and I found the resolution to be particularly relevant – a clear reminder of the far-reaching implications of the current tensions.
As we told our Chinese counterparts, “The seas should be used to save and improve our lives, and to ensure mankind’s future survival.
They should not be places where peoples are killed and institutions destroyed.”
Fortunately, the Chinese accepted and even reiterated this fundamental belief.
In practice, this belief should translate into a commitment to avoid violent confrontation of any kind.
A war would do serious damage to the interests of both the Philippines and China, which possesses substantial wealth and military might, but needs peace to transform its economy and deliver a better life to the hundreds of millions of Chinese who still live in poverty.
Perhaps more significant, given the central role of the United States in Asian security, any dispute with China could quickly escalate.
This stark reality must underpin all discussions about the West Philippine Sea in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
Of course, bilateral talks may be contentious at times.
But there is plenty of incentive to make progress.
Indeed, our geographical proximity makes the search for common ground between China and the Philippines a necessity, not a choice.
Re-establishing the kind of long-term, mutually beneficial bilateral relationship that we enjoyed in the past – one that supports peace and sustainable development in our region – must be a priority for both sides.
Don’t Do Stupid Economic Stuff
PARIS – On August 30, 2013, the United States was about to launch air strikes on Syria, where more than a thousand civilians had died in a sarin gas attack perpetrated by the army of President Bashar al-Assad.
But a few hours before the strikes were to commence, US President Barack Obama canceled them, surprising America’s allies.
Instead, US diplomats engineered a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whereby Russia would take responsibility for removing chemical weapons from Syria.
The Syrian civil war went on, without the US becoming directly involved.
According to his recent interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic magazine, Obama is “very proud” of the moment when he considered, pondered, and, bucking his advisers, decided not to follow the “Washington playbook.”
Not everybody applauded.
According to Goldberg, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton privately complained that “if you say that you are going to strike, you have to strike.”
But Obama refused to give priority to credibility: “Dropping bombs on someone to prove that you’re willing to drop bombs on someone,” he said, “is just about the worst reason to use force.”
Obama’s stance was in keeping with his now-famous foreign and security-policy mantra: “Don’t do stupid shit.”
That dictum obviously alludes to his predecessor’s ill-judged decision to intervene in Iraq; but, more fundamentally, it expresses the way Obama approaches the balance of risks involved in major policy choices.
Evidently, he does not hold concerns about credibility in high enough regard to let his hands be tied.
The adequacy of the ultimate decision matters more to him than consistency with previous statements.
Preserving freedom of choice in addressing a problem is more important than sending the right message.
Judgment should not be obfuscated.
One thing that security policy and economic policy have in common is that they force governments to choose between minimizing immediate damages and safeguarding credibility.
Economic debates also frequently place in opposition to one another those who emphasize unconstrained judgment and those who regard consistency as the gold standard of good policy.
This tradeoff was apparent in the summer of 2008, as the global financial crisis came to a head.
After the US government had decided to bail out the investment bank Bear Stearns and to backstop the mortgage-finance agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a congressional uproar led President George W. Bush’s administration to vow not to inject any public money into Lehman Brothers, another ailing investment bank.
When it became clear that no private investor was willing to take over Lehman, the US Treasury lacked the resources needed to prevent a disaster.
And disaster happened on September 15.
Similar tradeoffs repeatedly arose in the course of the euro crisis.
Virtually all major episodes involved a choice between sticking to first principles and finding a way to fix a fast-developing crisis.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s own mantra was not quite the same as Obama’s.
For her, unconventional action could be justified only by an imminent existential threat to the eurozone’s stability.
This so-called ultima ratio doctrine was repeatedly invoked to postpone decisions or reject early fixes.
It is hard to overestimate the significance of the dilemma between solving looming problems and avoiding moral hazard.
It is pervasive in finance and arises often in monetary or fiscal decisions.
One school of thought, epitomized by the US government, considers moral hazard a valid concern but thinks it shouldn’t be overplayed: “Firehouses don’t cause fires,” as former Treasury secretary Tim Geithner put it (or, in the words of Federal Reserve Deputy Chair Stan Fischer, “condoms don’t cause sex”).
Germany is the most prominent avatar of the other view: The long-term consequences of any decision should guide policy choices, and the expectation of insurance must not cause imprudence.
The existence of such differences in attitude should come as no surprise: The tradeoff is a real one, and policymakers may have different views, depending on their experience and time preference.
The German school of thought, for example, emphasizes a policy system’s permanent rules of the game and tends to disregard the short-term costs of particular decisions.
Another, perhaps deeper reason is power.
For seven decades, the US government has been the ultimate fireman of the global system.
Over that period, it has dealt with myriad crises worldwide and has learned to value discretion more than policy consistency.
So what can be done to avoid stupid economic policymaking?
What matters most is the transparency of the decision-making process and its aftermath.
Avoiding the rigidity of rules must not lead to arbitrariness.
A robust and critical exchange of arguments, and – especially when urgency does not leave time for prior discussion – awareness that any decision will need to be explained and justified ex post are excellent antidotes to the abuse of discretionary powers.
Debate and accountability can go a long way toward killing bad ideas.
Arguably, this is easier to apply to economic policymaking than to the battlefield.
But even economic and financial decisions may require secrecy and speed.
This is no reason for the relevant institutions not to organize an effective internal process or ensure proper ex post scrutiny.
In this respect, much progress can still be made.
Improving Governance in the Arab World
WASHINGTON, DC – A recent survey of 100 Arab thought leaders conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace revealed a sweeping consensus about what underlies many of the region’s problems: a lack of good governance.
Indeed, those polled emphasized domestic problems resulting from that failure – authoritarianism, corruption, outdated education systems, and unemployment – over regional concerns, including the threat of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) or interference by regional heavyweights or outside powers.
This is not new information.
The Arab Spring uprisings brought to the fore the inadequacy of the region’s outdated social contracts in the face of current political and economic challenges.
Yet Arab governments still seem not to have gotten the message.
Five years after the uprisings erupted, Arab citizens have little – in some cases, even less – voice in running their countries’ affairs.
Moreover, they depend on rentier economies that are unable to create enough jobs for their young, educated populations.
And they face an alarming absence of the rule of law, leaving them with no assurances that they will be treated equally, regardless of gender, ethnic origin, or religion.
But poor governance today does not mean the Arab world is doomed to failure.
Tunisia serves as a beacon of hope.
After the 2011 revolution, it pursued a consensual, inclusive process to develop a new social contract that upholds all of its people’s individual and collective rights.
While Tunisia still faces serious economic and security problems, the national dialogue that the country has undertaken is the crucial first step toward resolving them.
Other Arab societies now must undertake similar dialogues, with the ultimate goal of creating economies and institutions that meet their people’s needs.
History has taught us that such transformational processes take time.
The long-suppressed ideas and energies unleashed by events like the Arab Spring must mature before having their full effect on society.
Consider the uprisings in Europe in 1848, in which citizens protested against authoritarian, feudal systems and the lack of economic opportunity.
By the end of that year, status quo forces managed to retake the reins of power, and the uprisings appeared to have been all but crushed.
But something had changed.
Taboos had been broken, and during the subsequent decades, technological advances enabled the spread of new ideas.
It was not long before feudalism began to dissolve; liberal and democratic values gained traction; women secured greater rights; and economic systems emerged that could boost productivity, achieve high growth rates, and improve living standards.
A similar process is unfolding gradually in the Arab world, with citizens (especially young people) who lack trust in their governments seeking alternative sources of information and new ways to survive economically.
This shift has so far gone largely unnoticed by governments, a reflection of just how disconnected they are from their own people.
But it will soon be impossible to ignore.
All of this comes at a time when another important development is underway: Oil-based rentier systems are rapidly diminishing, owing to the steep decline in energy prices over the last two years.
In particular, Saudi Arabia has been forced to initiate a shift toward an economic model that emphasizes investment and productivity as the main drivers of economic growth.
Other countries in the region will have to follow suit and reform their economic systems, or face the wrath of their increasingly disgruntled citizens.
One important element of economic-reform strategies will be technology.
Already, 240 million Arabs – largely young people – have access to the Internet through mobile phones; by 2020, it is estimated that all Arab youth will be connected.
Technology is facilitating the creation and sharing of knowledge, in a region that has historically lagged in this area, and technology start-ups are on the rise.
This is not to say that technology is a panacea for the region.
After all, ISIS is also using technology, but in a sinister way: to spread gruesome propaganda and recruit new members.
But technology can speed up the Arab world’s social and economic progress, even as countries build a modern institutional framework capable of supporting it.
Nowadays, no country can evolve without developing effective and credible institutions, establishing a meaningful system of political checks and balances, and diffusing control over decision-making.
These elements are vital to enable countries to offer their citizens an adequate quality of life.
In time, the Arab world will have them.
While the international community is focused on ISIS or Iran’s destructive role in the Middle East, most Arabs are focused on improving their lives.
Their governments should encourage them.
Doing Well by Doing Good
WASHINGTON, DC – Two years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to open access to his company’s patents to anyone – a move that ran completely counter to traditional competitive behavior.
Why would a company give away its hard-earned designs and technology to its rivals?
Whatever one may think of Musk, his courage must be appreciated.
He is rewriting the rules of business, based on the belief that Tesla’s success depends on that of the entire market for electric cars, and that his company’s commercial interests are inseparable from the interests of society.
Musk’s unconventional strategy could upend entire industries – for the benefit of all.
If Tesla’s open patents succeed in bringing other players into the sector, it could transform what is now a niche product into a mass-market phenomenon – a transformation that would significantly advance the fight against climate change.
There is no sense in asking whether Musk is trying to fight climate change or just trying to make a buck.
He is doing both.
And, furthermore, it is exactly this type of public-minded capitalism that will be required of successful companies in the future.
We live in an age of enormous transformation – an era in which focusing solely on near-term financial results is a prescription for extinction, and addressing societal needs is entirely compatible with long-term profitability.
While this view may seem unconventional at the moment, time will prove the pioneers right.
In the years ahead, successful companies will take the lead in tackling the most urgent development challenges of our time – everything from poverty and disease to climate change.
Consider Kenya’s M-KOPA, a company that installs solar power kits and collects payments via mobile phones.
By delivering electricity at lower prices than their customers would otherwise have to pay for kerosene lighting, M-KOPA has delivered solar power to more than 330,000 low-income households in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.
New connections are being added at a rate of 500 homes per day.
Phasing out kerosene has an immense impact on the lives of M-KOPA’s customers, their children’s health, and the environment.
But the company cannot be considered a charity: its revenues are projected to reach $60 million in 2016, having increased by 400% in just two years.
Another example is to be found in Peru, where more than 30 financial institutions chose a similarly unconventional path to profitability, working together to establish Modelo Perú – a platform that provides digital financial services.
In Peru, cash transactions had been the norm.
The participating companies decided that it was in their collective interest to create a single national platform for mobile payments, and they worked with the government and four telecommunications companies to construct one.
Today, the number of Peruvians with access to affordable financial services has expanded significantly.
And the institutions behind the project have gained access to a much deeper pool of consumers than they would have if each had developed a separate digital platform.
My own organization, the International Finance Corporation, also knows the value of rewriting the rules.
In 2006, we introduced performance standards to help our client companies mitigate risks by applying environmental and social (E&S) principles and advancing the private sector’s leadership in responsible development.
Initially, other financial institutions were skeptical of our approach; they saw the application of strict standards as a sure way to lose business and profits.
Within a few years, however, major banks and development institutions came together to establish the Equator Principles based on our E&S standards.
Today, our standards are applied to project finance around the world.
They have helped level the playing field within the banking industry.
In addition, through the Sustainable Banking Network – an association of central banks, regulators, and financial trade associations – we are helping countries develop national policies to boost green finance.
And we are seeing a growing appetite for this kind of expertise, from within governments and the private sector.
The world has the momentum – and the means – to create a mass market for sustainable finance, one in which investment decisions are driven as much by E&S and good governance criteria as by creditworthiness.
Companies that have signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment have combined assets under management totaling $60 trillion.
A growing number of businesses recognize that today’s formula for success includes a focus on pressing societal needs.
As Musk has found out, the trick is to address those needs in ways that are profitable and sustainable in the long run, and then, when a beneficial business solution is identified, to work together to facilitate its large-scale deployment.
With a willingness to challenge assumptions and change conventional perceptions, we can change the world for the better.
An Optimistic Case for the Euro
CAMBRIDGE – The prospects for the euro and the eurozone remain uncertain.
But recent events at the European Central Bank, in Germany, and in global financial markets, make it worthwhile to consider a favorable scenario for the common currency’s future.
The ECB has promised to buy Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds to keep their interest rates down, provided these countries ask for lines of credit from the European Stability Mechanism and adhere to agreed fiscal reforms.
Germany’s Constitutional Court has approved the country’s participation in the ESM, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has given her blessing to the ECB’s bond-buying plan, despite strong public objections from the Bundesbank.
And the international bond market has expressed its approval by cutting interest rates on Italy’s ten-year bonds to 4.8%, and on Spain’s to 5.5%.
Italian bond rates had already been falling before ECB President Mario Draghi announced the conditional bond-buying plans.
That reflected the substantial progress Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government had already made.
New legislation will slow the growth of pension benefits substantially, and the Monti government’s increase in taxes on owner-occupied real estate will raise significant revenue without the adverse incentive effects that would occur if rates for personal-income, payroll, or value-added taxes were raised.
Reflecting these reforms, the International Monetary Fund recently projected that Italy will have a cyclically adjusted budget surplus of nearly 1% of GDP in 2013.
Unfortunately, because Italy will still be in recession next year, its actual deficit is expected to be 1.8% of GDP, adding to the national debt.
But economic recovery will come to Italy, moving the budget into surplus.
When the markets see that coming, they will drive Italy’s sovereign interest rates even lower.&nbsp; Given Italy’s very large national debt, interest payments add more than 5% of GDP to the fiscal deficit.
The combination of economic recovery and lower interest rates would produce a virtuous dynamic in which falling interest rates and a rising budget surplus are mutually reinforcing.
The situation in Spain is not as good.
Despite cuts in government spending and increases in taxes, the IMF still projects the cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit to exceed 3.2% of GDP in 2013 and 2.3% of GDP in 2015.
The key to solving Spain’s fiscal problem lies in the semi-autonomous regions that generate spending and shift the financing burden to Madrid.
Perhaps Italy’s success will help to convince Spain to adopt the tough measures that reduce projected future deficits without more current austerity.
If Italy and Spain have budget surpluses and declining debt/GDP ratios, financial markets will reduce the interest rates on their bonds without the proposed ECB purchases.
That would remove the serious risk that the ECB could start buying bonds on the basis of agreed fiscal packages, and then be forced to react if governments fall short on implementing them.
None of this would be enough to save Greece, where the fiscal deficit is 7.5% of GDP, or Portugal, where it is 5% of GDP.
But if Italy and Spain are no longer at risk of default, or of abandoning the euro, Germany and other eurozone leaders will have room to decide whether to continue funding these very small states or politely invite them to leave the euro and return to national currencies.
Moreover, even under this optimistic scenario, the problem of the current-account deficits of Italy, Spain, and the other peripheral countries will remain.
Differences among the eurozone countries in growth rates of productivity and wages will continue to cause disparities in international competitiveness, resulting in trade and current-account imbalances.
Germany now has a current-account surplus of about $215 billion a year, while the rest of the eurozone is running a current-account deficit of about $140 billion.
Italy, Spain, and France all have current-account deficits equal to 2% or more of their GDP.
As they come out of their cyclical recessions, incomes will rise, leading to increased imports and even larger current-account deficits.
Those deficits must be financed by net inflows of funds from other countries.
If Italy, Spain, and France were not part of the eurozone, they could allow their currencies to devalue; weaker exchange rates would increase exports and reduce imports, eliminating their current-account deficits.
Moreover, the increase in exports and the shift from imports to domestically produced goods and services would strengthen their economies, thereby reducing their fiscal deficits as tax revenues rose and transfers declined.
And a stronger economy would help domestic banks by reducing potential bad debt and mortgage defaults.
But, of course, Italy, Spain, and France are part of the eurozone and therefore cannot devalue.
That is why I believe that these countries – and the eurozone more generally – would benefit from euro depreciation.
Although a weaker euro would not increase their competitiveness relative to Germany and other eurozone countries, it would improve their competitiveness relative to all non-eurozone countries.
If the euro falls by 20-25%, bringing it close to parity with the dollar and weakening it to a similar extent against other currencies, the current-account deficits in Italy, Spain, and France would shrink and their economies would strengthen.
German exports would also benefit from a weaker euro, boosting overall economic demand in Germany.
It is ironic that the ECB’s offer to buy Italian and Spanish debt has exacerbated external imbalances by raising the value of the euro.
Perhaps that is just a temporary effect and the euro will decline when global financial markets recognize that a weaker exchange rate is needed to reduce current-account deficits in the eurozone’s three major Latin countries.
If not, the ECB’s next challenge will be to find a way to talk the euro down.
Overcoming the Public-Sector Coordination Problem
CAMBRIDGE – Public-private cooperation or coordination is receiving considerable attention nowadays.
A plethora of centers for the study of business and government relations have been created, and researchers have produced a large literature on the design, analysis, and evaluation of public-private partnerships.
Even the World Economic Forum has been transformed into “an international organization for public-private cooperation.”
Of course, private-private coordination has been the essence of economics for the past 250 years.
While Adam Smith started us on the optimistic belief that an invisible hand would take care of most coordination issues, in the intervening period economists discovered all sorts of market failures, informational imperfections, and incentive problems, which have given rise to rules, regulations, and other forms of government and societal intervention.
This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was granted to Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmström for their contribution to understanding contracts, a fundamental device for private-private coordination.
But much less attention has been devoted to public-public coordination.
This is surprising, because anyone who has worked in government knows that coordinating the public and private sectors to address a particular issue, while often complicated, is a cakewalk compared to the problem of herding the cats that constitute the panoply of government agencies.
The reason for this difficulty is the other side of Smith’s invisible hand.
In the private sector, the market mechanism provides the elements of a self-organizing system, thanks to three interconnected structures: the price system, the profit motive, and capital markets.
In the public sector, this mechanism is either non-existent or significantly different and less efficient.
The price system is a decentralized information system that reveals people’s willingness to buy or sell and the wisdom of buying some inputs in order to produce a certain output at the going market price.
The profit motive provides an incentive system to respond to the information that prices contain.
And capital markets mobilize resources for activities that are expected to be profitable; those that adequately respond to prices.
By contrast, most public services have no prices, there is not supposed to be a profit motive in their provision, and capital markets are not supposed to choose what to fund: the money funds whatever is in the budget.
In the budget process, the finance ministry estimates revenues, targets a certain fiscal deficit, and deduces the overall spending level consistent with these numbers.
It then proceeds to allocate funds to all existing commitments and entitlement programs.
The remainder is assigned for discretionary spending across various ministries in proportions often related to past budgets.
Typically, ministers fight jealously over these spoils, as their ability to leave a mark in their respective fields often depends on it.
Under this system, why would a minister spend money on another minister’s priorities?
But addressing most problems in government involves multiple agencies.
For example, bottlenecks in the tourism industry may involve airports, tourist visa requirements, or hotel construction permits, none of which falls under the tourism ministry.
Organizing the public-private dialogue to identify problems and propose solutions is eminently doable, as Piero Ghezzi, Peru’s former minister of production has shown.
But organizing the public agencies to respond in a coordinated manner, given existing budgetary procedures, is a different matter: the ministry of foreign affairs may not give much importance to tourist visas.
With separate and relatively independent budgets, coordination becomes very difficult.
One solution is to create a market-like mechanism within the government.
The idea is to assign a portion of the budget, say 3-5%, to a central pool of funds to be requested by one ministry but to be executed by another, as if one was buying services from the other.
These resources would allow the demand for public goods to permeate the allocation of budgetary resources across ministries.
Two metaphors may help clarify the idea.
Universal banks offer deposit accounts, credit cards, mortgages, business loans, and other products.
At the front end, an account executive manages the relationship with the client.
At the back end, a different department produces each service.
The amount of resources that the back end gets depends on the demand for services identified at the front end.
A similar situation arises in international financial institutions like the World Bank.
At the front end, country directors manage the relationship with the “client,” meaning the country government.
At the back end, experts in education, roads, electricity, water, and health care design and analyze project loans.
The budget is given to the front end and the back end must “sell” their services to the front end, thus creating an internal market, so that resources are allocated based on client needs.
While all ministries have their external constituencies, some ministries have more of a front-end, “account executive” nature: their core mission involves coordinating the provision of public goods to different parts of the economy.
Ministries of agriculture, industry, tourism, and urban development, are some examples.
By contrast, finance and infrastructure ministries of have more of a back-end character.
The central pool of resources is designed to increase the responsiveness of one ministry’s back end to the demands of society as identified by another ministry’s front end, without these resources competing with the priorities that each ministry has for its “own” budget.
By allocating a small proportion of each year’s budget to priorities identified in this way, we may find that, over time, budgets become more responsive and better reflect society’s evolving needs.
And public-private coordination may flourish once the public-public bottlenecks are removed.
In Cautious Praise of Latin America
BUENOS AIRES/WASHINGTON, DC – US President Barack Obama’s trip this month to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador is a good opportunity to assess the recent performance of Latin America’s economies, and to analyze their prospects and risks going forward.
Latin America showed strong resilience during the international financial crisis.
While aggregate output fell in 2009, it recovered extremely fast.
As the crisis hit, stronger banking systems and effective macroeconomic policies – including fiscal responsibility and low public debt, exchange-rate flexibility, and a large accumulation of international reserves – allowed Latin American countries to implement unprecedented countercyclical policies.
Political peace was also preserved through social policies that reduced organized conflict.
In short, while Latin America’s economies were helped by high commodity prices, it is indisputable that the significant economic reforms adopted in most countries enabled them to have a “good crisis.”
But this successful performance, together with high growth rates from 2004 to 2010, seems to have led to an unhealthy level of self-satisfaction among observers and policymakers in some countries.
Indeed, many now apparently assume that their countries have become immune to future shocks.
Such complacency is unwarranted.
Although growth has indeed been significantly above trend in recent years, performance over the entire decade was unimpressive.
Second, although countries have laid the groundwork for sustainable growth in a number of areas, the reform agenda remains vast, and most countries are not yet able to avoid the boom-and-bust cycles that have long plagued them.
When it comes to GDP growth, most countries recorded 3-4% annual rates on average in the period between the crises of 1999 and 2009.
Countries like Uruguay, Mexico, and        El Salvador grew at a mere 2-2.5% rate.
Only the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Panama attained 6-7% growth.
And, on a per capita basis, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, El Salvador, and Mexico eked out less than 2% annual growth on average.
But it is the agenda of pending reforms that should stifle excessive complacency.
That agenda, with obvious country differences, spans five important areas, which together should be the focus of policy attention aimed at solidifying the region’s transformation.
First, governments need to adopt urgent business-climate reforms in order to foster investment, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
Latin America currently lacks a level playing field for entrepreneurship.
Without it, the region will not be able to overcome its low levels of productivity and competitiveness.
Second, Latin America needs to overhaul its weak health and education systems.
Rapidly expanding demand for skilled workers cannot be satisfied as long as average schooling still totals eight years.
Third, despite some significant improvements, major deficiencies in the coverage and quality of infrastructure are clearly affecting competitiveness and increasing costs.
The private sector needs to become more involved in infrastructure, which requires the adoption of adequate public-private partnerships.
Fourth, the social gains of the recent past, while important, are far from sufficient.
Although the region’s poverty rate has decreased by 10 percentage points in the last decade, 180 million people remain below the line, more than 70 million are still indigent, and a large percentage remains just above the poverty line.
Thus, soaring food and fuel prices are likely to upset efforts by governments to improve income distribution and social cohesion.
Finally, while Latin America’s resource-based economic model and the increasing importance of China in the region catalyzed the growth spurt that began in 2004, the share of high-technology manufacturing and services exports has decreased.
Unless this trend is reversed, it will be difficult to improve the quality of jobs in the region, which could jeopardize social and political stability.
Latin America has come a long way.
It passed the crisis test with flying colors, and the future is promising.
But the region’s success should be seen as a base for cementing progress, rather than as an end in itself.
Otherwise, countries risk losing their hard-won gains.
The Right Incentives for a Low-Carbon Future
BERLIN – The climate agreement that world leaders reached in Paris last month has been widely celebrated for establishing the ambitious target of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
But the agreement is just one step, albeit an important one.
Policymakers now must figure out how to achieve this goal – no easy feat, especially given that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, steadily rising costs for conventional energy cannot be counted on to propel the necessary shift toward a low-carbon future.
At first glance, the logic of negative economic incentives seems sound.
If, say, driving a gas-guzzling car becomes more expensive, people will presumably be less likely to do it.
But the impact of changing fuel prices is partial and delayed.
While drivers may purchase a more fuel-efficient car in the long run, they are more likely, in the shorter run, to reduce other kinds of consumption to offset the rise in cost.
When it comes to resolving a problem as urgent as climate change, Keynes’s famous dictum – “In the long run, we are all dead” – clearly applies.
Moreover, even if consumers did respond efficiently, fossil-fuel prices are dictated largely by heavily financialized markets, which tend to be extremely volatile.
The sharp decline in oil prices over the last 18 months is a case in point.
Not only have oil prices themselves failed to spur a reduction in consumption; they have undermined incentives to develop alternative energy sources.
Investing in, say, solar power may have seemed worthwhile when oil cost $100 per barrel, but it looked a lot less appealing when the price dropped below $50.
Conceivably, policymakers could raise taxes to offset such declines.
But such hikes sometimes (like now) would have to be huge, and adopting erratic policies that mirror the volatility of the market is never a good idea.
Carbon pricing could experience a similar fate.
In the European Union, carbon prices have been low for several years, and for now market participants seem to be following the herd in believing that they will remain so.
But there is no guarantee that free emissions trading will not function like other financial markets, producing sharp fluctuations in CO2 prices.
Should expectations suddenly change, the herd might turn and run in the opposite direction, causing CO2 prices to soar.
Yet another problem with the price-based approach to mitigating climate change is that it fails to account for markets’ potential to create perverse incentives.
When the cost of conventional energy rises, new suppliers see an opportunity; thus, before June 2014, when oil prices were high, investors poured resources into developing shale oil and gas in the United States.
The additional supply, however, ultimately causes prices to fall, reducing the incentive to invest in alternative energy sources or energy efficiency.
This is a normal market reaction, but it does not advance the fight against climate change, which would require steadily rising costs.
The final reason why negative incentives alone are inadequate to mitigate climate change may be the most irrational: after some years of rising taxes, the public is staunchly opposed to any policy that may increase energy prices, regardless of whether current prices are high or low.
People are so convinced that energy costs are “exploding,” despite the recent oil-price collapse, that any new project implying even slightly higher prices – even if overall energy prices are still lower than they were five years ago – is now exceedingly difficult to initiate.
The implication is clear: When policymakers get to work designing strategies for executing the Paris agreement, they should not rely heavily on rising energy costs to advance their objectives.
A strategy that assumes that the market will punish those who do not invest in a low-carbon future is not realistic.
A better approach is possible: Directly reward those who do invest in a low-carbon future, whether by enhancing energy efficiency or developing clean energy sources.
For example, governments could implement accelerated depreciation schemes for investment in low-carbon businesses; offer subsidies for investment in energy-efficient buildings; and create policies that favor industrial innovation aimed at reducing emissions and boosting competitiveness.
All of this would make fossil fuels less attractive to both investors and consumers.
While an approach based on such positive incentives would be costlier than tax hikes in the short run, the long-term benefits can hardly be overstated.
At a time of strong resistance to higher energy costs, this may well be among the most effective – not to mention politically savvy – mechanisms for advancing the goals set out in Paris.
The Inclusive Road to Growth
GENEVA – There is no bigger policy challenge preoccupying leaders around the world than meeting the need to expand participation in the benefits of economic growth and globalization.
Indeed, a geographically and ideologically diverse consensus has emerged that a new – or at least much improved – model of economic development will be required if truly greater inclusiveness is to be achieved.
Unfortunately, this political consensus has so far remained aspirational, rather than prescriptive.
Policymakers have yet to develop an internationally recognized policy framework – with a corresponding set of indicators and measurable milestones – to guide countries targeting broad-based improvements in living standards, rather than simply continuing to use GDP growth as the bottom-line measure of national economic performance.
The extent to which growth creates opportunities and improves living standards depends on an array of structural and institutional economic policies, including many in areas outside of education and redistribution (the areas most commonly featured in discussions about inequality).
There is a growing recognition of the importance of institutions – particularly legal frameworks and public agencies that administer rules and incentives – in the development process.
But this recognition has yet to penetrate fully the approach to economic growth that most economists and policymakers take.
The role that institutions play in shaping economic growth was a key finding of the landmark 1993 World Bank study, The East Asian Miracle, which examined how eight countries in the region achieved “high growth and declining inequality” from 1965 to 1990.
The Commission on Growth and Development, chaired by the Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence, reached a similar conclusion in its 2008 report, The Growth Report: Strategies for Sustained Growth and Inclusive Development.
The lesson is also apparent in the economic history of the twentieth century, when – especially in the decades following the Great Depression – most of today’s advanced industrialized countries underwent a sustained process of institutional deepening that broadened the base and strengthened the resilience of their economies.
Reforms targeting labor policy, the investment climate, social insurance, competition, education, and infrastructure created a more inclusive and more sustainable growth model by spreading purchasing power, which supported aggregate demand and reduced vulnerability to investment-driven booms and busts.
It is a lesson that needs relearning today, as the world economy continues to struggle to find a more solid foundation for growth and escape the shadow of the 2008-2009 crisis.
Adopting a more socially inclusive model of growth and development will require widening the lens through which priorities are set when shaping national economic strategies.
Appropriate policies regarding macroeconomics, trade, and financial stability will remain crucial to establishing the basic conditions for the efficient allocation of resources underpinning growth.
But such policies are only part of the solution.
Developing domestic institutions and appropriate incentives in a broad range of other areas that are relevant for social inclusion will be vital to improving living standards, while reinforcing the growth process itself.
Both types of policies – macroeconomic management and measures that boost inclusiveness – deserve equal attention in national economic strategies.
It is important not to underestimate the cultural change that this will require of governments and economic advisers.
The concept of “structural reform” usually refers to measures aimed at boosting economic growth by sharpening market signals and restoring the health of public finances.
Such policies are often implemented in response to fiscal or balance-of-payments crises and frequently squeeze living standards in the short term.
But the strengthening of institutions in areas that promote social inclusion is also a form of structural reform, in this case aimed at maximizing the contribution of growth to broad living standards and strengthening its resilience.
Our research has identified 15 domains that are important for promoting social inclusion.
These include educational opportunity and performance, the relationship between productivity and wage growth, the concentration of economic rents, the effectiveness of the financial system’s intermediation of investment in the real economy, physical and digital infrastructure, and the coverage and adequacy of basic social protections.
They also include areas not traditionally considered equality-enhancing – such as facilitating asset-building through small-business and home ownership and combating corruption – but that are just as important as education or redistribution for improving living standards.
There is no single ideal institutional mix for inclusive growth, but all countries should begin to think more systematically about strengthening their institutions and creating incentives to promote inclusive growth.
There is much room for improvement.
In cross-country comparisons, no country outperforms its peers in every domain.
Indeed, not a single country scores above average across all 15.
It is possible, indeed essential, to be pro-equality and pro-growth, to advocate strengthening social inclusion while promoting the efficiency of markets.
An inclusive model for growth and development is inherently pro-labor and pro-business.
It is time to put our aspirations to work.
Economics in a Time of Political Instability
MILAN/STANFORD – Over the last 35 years, Western democracies have seen a rapid rise in political instability, characterized by frequent shifts in governing parties and their programs and philosophies, driven at least partly by economic transformation and hardship.
The question now is how to improve economic performance at a time when political instability is impeding effective policymaking.
In a recent article, one of us (David Brady) shows the correlation between rising political instability and declining economic performance, pointing out that countries with below-average economic performance have experienced the most electoral volatility.
More specifically, such instability corresponds with a decline in the share of industrial or manufacturing employment in advanced countries.
Though the extent of the decline varies somewhat across countries – it has been less sharp in Germany than in the United States, for example – the pattern is fairly ubiquitous.
Over the last 15 years, in particular, increasingly powerful digital technologies enabled the automation and disintermediation of “routine” white- and blue-collar jobs.
With advances in robotics, materials, 3D printing, and artificial intelligence, one can reasonably expect the scope of “routine” jobs that can be automated to continue expanding.
The rise of digital technologies also boosted companies’ ability to manage complex multi-source global supply chains efficiently, and thus take advantage of global economic integration.
As services became increasingly tradable, manufacturing declined steadily as a share of employment, from 40% in 1960 to about 20% today.
But, in most advanced countries, the tradable sector did not generate much employment, at least not enough to offset declines in manufacturing.
In the United States, for example, net employment generation in the third of the economy that produces tradable goods and services was essentially zero over the last two decades.
Partly driven by these trends, the share of national income going to labor, which rose in the early post-war period, began falling in the 1970s.
While globalization and digital technologies have produced broad-based benefits, in the form of lower costs for goods and an expanded array of services, they have also fueled job and income polarization, with a declining share of middle-income jobs and a rising share of lower- and higher-income jobs splitting the income distribution.
The magnitude of this polarization varies by country, owing to disparate social-security systems and policy responses.
Until 2008, when economic crisis roiled much of the world, the concerns associated with rising inequality were at least partly masked by higher leverage, with government expenditures and wealth effects from rising asset prices supporting household consumption and propping up growth and employment.
When that growth pattern broke down, economic and political conditions deteriorated rapidly.
Most obvious, the drop in growth and employment has amplified the adverse effects of job and income polarization.
Beyond the obvious practical problems this has raised, it has impinged on many citizens’ sense of identity.
In the post-war industrial era, one could reasonably expect to earn a decent living, support a family, and contribute in a visible way to the country’s overall prosperity.
Being shunted into the non-tradable service sector, with lower income and less job security, caused many to lose self-esteem, as well as fostering resentment toward the system that brought about the shift.
(It did not help matters that the same system bailed out the main driver of the economic crisis, the financial sector – a move that exposed a stark disparity between exigency and fairness.)
While technology-driven economic transformation is not new, it has never occurred as rapidly or on as large a scale as it has over the last 35 years, when it has been turbocharged by globalization.
With their experiences and fortunes changing fast, many citizens now believe that powerful forces are operating outside the control of existing governance structures, insulated from policy intervention.
And, to some extent, they are right.
The result is a widespread loss of confidence in government’s motivations, capabilities, and competence.
This sentiment does not appear to be mitigated much by a recognition of the complexity of the challenge of maintaining incentives and dynamism while addressing rising inequality (which, at its most extreme, undermines equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility).
As Brady points out, during the more stable period immediately following World War II, growth patterns were largely benign from a distributional perspective, and political parties were largely organized around the interests of labor and capital, with an overlay of common interests created by the Cold War.
As outcomes have become increasingly unequal, there has been a fragmentation of interests across the electoral spectrum, leading to instability in electoral outcomes, political paralysis, and frequent changes in policy frameworks and direction.
This has several economic consequences.
One is policy-induced uncertainty, which, by most accounts, amounts to a major impediment to investment.
Another is the distinct lack of consensus on an agenda to restore growth, reduce unemployment, reestablish a pattern of inclusiveness, and retain the benefits of global interconnectedness.
On one level, it is hard not to see this as a self-reinforcing destructive cycle.
Political instability reduces the likelihood of defining and implementing a reasonably comprehensive, coherent, and sustained economic-policy agenda.
The resulting persistence of low growth, high unemployment, and rising inequality fuels continued political instability and fragmentation, which further undermines officials’ capacity to implement effective economic policies.
But on another level, these trends may actually be healthy, as they bring concerns about globalization, structural transformation, and governance – which have so far been expressed mainly in the streets – into the political process.
This kind of direct connection between citizens’ concerns and governance is, after all, a core strength of democracy.
When a developing country gets stuck in a no-growth equilibrium, building a consensus on a forward-looking vision for inclusive growth is always the critical first step toward achieving better economic performance and the policies that support it.
That is what the most effective leaders have done.
The principle is the same for developed countries.
Our best hope is that today’s leaders understand it and will adhere to it, thereby putting their creative energies to work on a new vision that places their countries on a path to greater prosperity and equity.
The Economics of Inclusion
CAMBRIDGE – Many people find economic growth to be a morally ambiguous goal – palatable, they would argue, only if it is broadly shared and environmentally sustainable.
But, as my father likes to say, “Why make something difficult if you can make it impossible?”
If we do not know how to make economies grow, it follows that we do not know how to make them grow in an inclusive and sustainable way.
Economists have struggled with the tradeoff between growth and equity for centuries.
What is the nature of the tradeoff?
How can it be minimized?
Can growth be sustained if it leads to greater inequality?
Does redistribution hamper growth?
I believe that both inequality and slow growth often result from a particular form of exclusion.
Adam Smith famously argued that, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”
So why would growth not include people out of self-interest, rather than requiring deliberate collective action?
It is well known that levels of income are dramatically different around the world.
Thanks to more than two centuries of sustained growth, average per capita income in the OECD countries is just under $40,000 – 3.3, 11.3, and 17.7 times more than in Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.
Sustained growth has obviously not included the majority of humanity.
What is less well known is that huge gaps exist within countries.
For example, GDP per worker in the State of Nuevo León in Mexico is eight times that of Guerrero, while output per worker in the Department of Chocó in Colombia is less than one-fifth that of Bogotá.
Why would capitalists extract so little value from workers if they could get so much more out of them?
The answer is surprisingly simple: fixed costs.
Modern production is based on networks of networks.
A modern firm is a network of people with different expertise: production, logistics, marketing, sales, accounting, human-resource management, and so on.
But the firm itself must be connected to a web of other firms – its suppliers and customers – through multi-modal transportation and telecommunication networks.
To form part of the modern economy, firms and households need access to networks that deliver water and dispose of sewage and solid waste.
They need access to the grids that distribute electricity, urban transportation, goods, education, health care, security, and finance.
Lack of access to any of these networks causes enormous declines in productivity.
Just think of how your life would change if you had to walk two hours each day to obtain drinking water or wood for fuel.
But connecting to these networks involves fixed costs.
Before anyone can consume a kilowatt-hour, a liter of water, or a bus ride, somebody has to get a copper wire, a pipe, and a road to their house.
These fixed costs need to be recouped through long periods of use.
If income is expected to be low (perhaps because of other missing networks), it does not pay to connect a firm or a household to the network, because the fixed costs will not be recouped.
Growth is not inclusive because fixed costs deter markets from extending the networks that underpin it.
Changes in these fixed costs have outsize effects on who is included.
For example, the first telephone company started operations in 1878, while mobile phones are barely 25 years old.
One might expect that the former would have diffused more than the latter, just because of the time advantage.
Yet, in Afghanistan, there are 1,300 mobile phones for every landline.
In India, there are 72 cellphone lines&nbsp;per 100 persons, but only 2.6 landlines.
In fact, many Indians with mobile phones must defecate in the open because the median Indian does not have piped water in his house.
In Kenya, where there are 50 mobile phones per 100 people, only 16% of the population has access to electricity.
This reflects the fact that cellphone towers and handsets are much cheaper than pipes and copper wires, making it possible for the poor to pay the fixed costs.
It is the fixed costs that limit the diffusion of the networks.
So, a strategy for inclusive growth has to focus on ways of either lowering or paying for the fixed costs that connect people to networks.
Technology can help.
Clearly, cellphones have done wonders.
Cheaper photovoltaic cells may enable remote villages to get electricity without the fixed costs of long transmission lines.
Mobile banking may lower the fixed costs faced by traditional banks.
But in other areas, the issue involves public policy.
From its beginning in 1775, the US Postal Service was based on the principle “that every person in the United States – no matter who, no matter where – has the right to equal access to secure, efficient, and affordable mail service.”
A similar logic led to the expansion of the interstate highway system.
Obviously, all of this costs money, and it is here that priorities matter.
Poor countries lack the money to connect every person to every network at once, which explains the huge regional differences in income.
But too many resources are often allocated to palliative redistributive measures that address the consequences of&nbsp;exclusion rather than its causes.
Countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Peru, Uganda, Guatemala, Pakistan, and Venezuela spend substantially more money on subsidies and transfers than on public investment to expand infrastructure networks, education, and health care.
A strategy for inclusive growth must empower people by including them in the networks that make them productive. Inclusiveness should not be seen as a restriction on growth to make it morally palatable.
Viewed properly, inclusiveness is actually a strategy that enhances growth.
Redistribution or Inclusion?
RIYADH – The issue of rising income inequality loomed large at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos.
As is well known, the United States’ economy has grown significantly over the past three decades, but the median family’s income has not.
The top 1% (indeed, the top .01%) have captured most of the gains, something that societies are unlikely to tolerate for long.
Many fear that this is a global phenomenon with similar causes everywhere, a key claim in Thomas Piketty’s celebrated book Capital in Twenty-First Century.
But this proposition may be dangerously misleading.
It is crucial to distinguish inequality in productivity among firms from unequal distribution of income within firms.
The traditional battle between labor and capital has been about the latter, with workers and owners fighting over their share of the pie.
But there is surprisingly deep inequality in firms’ productivity, which means that the size of the pie varies radically.
This is especially true in developing countries, where it is common to find differences in productivity of a factor of ten at the provincial or state level and many times higher at the municipal level.
These two very different sources of inequality are often conflated, which prevents clear thinking on either one.
Both are related to a similar feature of modern production: the fact that it requires many complementary inputs.
This includes not only raw materials and machines, which can be shipped around, but also many specialized labor skills, infrastructure, and rules, which cannot be moved easily and hence need to be spatially collocated.
A shortage of any of these inputs can have disastrous effects on productivity.
This complementarity makes many parts of the developing world unsuitable for modern production, because key inputs are missing.
Even within cities, poor areas are so disconnected and inadequately endowed that productivity is dismal.
As a result, there are huge disparities among firms in terms of efficiency – and hence in the income they can distribute.
Given productivity constraints, redistribution is only palliative, not curative.
To address the problem requires investing in inclusion, endowing people with skills, and connecting them to the inputs and networks that can make them productive.
The dilemma is that poor countries lack the means to connect all places to all inputs.
They are faced with the choice of connecting a few places to most inputs and getting high productivity there, or putting some of the inputs in all places and getting very little productivity growth everywhere.
That is why development tends to be unequal.
The other problem of modern production is how to distribute the income generated by all of the complementary inputs.
Today, production is carried out not just by individuals, or even by teams of people within firms, but also by teams of firms, or value chains.
Just look at the credits at the end of any contemporary film.
Complementarity thus creates a problem of attribution.
How should credit for the final product be allocated, and to whom?
Economists have traditionally believed that each team member is paid her opportunity cost, that is, the highest income she could receive if she were kicked off the team.
In this context, if markets are characterized by what economists call perfect competition, once the opportunity cost of all inputs has been paid, there is nothing left to distribute.
But in real life, the team is worth more – often much more – than the opportunity cost of its members.
Who gets to pocket this “team surplus”?
Traditionally, the assumption has been that it accrues to shareholders.
But the rise of extreme CEO compensation in the US, documented by Piketty and others, may reflect CEOs’ ability to disrupt the team if they do not get part of the surplus.
After all, CEOs experience precipitous income declines when they are kicked out, indicating that they were paid far more than their opportunity cost.
In the case of successful start-ups, the money paid when they are acquired or go public accrues to those who put the team together.
For more conventional value chains, the surplus tends to go to the inputs that have greater market power.
Business schools teach their students to capture the maximum surplus in the value chain by focusing on inputs that are difficult for others to provide while ensuring that other inputs are “commoditized” and hence cannot capture more than their opportunity cost.
The gains do not accrue to the most deserving.
The rise of “capital,” which Piketty documents in France and other countries, is caused mostly by the appreciation of real estate, simply because good locations become more valuable in an increasingly networked economy.
As with land, the current intellectual property-rights regime, by over-protecting old ideas, may provide market power that not only exacerbates income inequality but also hurts innovation.
This means that policies aimed at ensuring an equitable outcome should rely on either owning or taxing the inputs that capture the “team surplus.”
One reason why Singapore has a well-funded government, despite low taxes, is that its successful policies caused the land and real estate it owned to explode in value, generating a huge revenue stream.
Similarly, the Colombian city of Medellín funds itself from the profits of its successful utility company, which is now a multinational player.&nbsp;The economist&nbsp;Dani Rodrik recently suggested&nbsp;that governments should fund themselves from the dividends earned by investing in public venture funds, thus socializing the gains from innovation.
Of course, capturing this surplus may allow for income redistribution, as many suggest; but a much bigger and sustainable bang can be achieved if the proceeds go instead to financing inclusion.
In the end, inclusive growth may generate a more prosperous and egalitarian society, whereas redistribution may fail to benefit either inclusion or growth.
China’s Multilateral Financial Mobilization
LONDON – The board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently approved China’s application to join – an application a decade in the making – and sent it on to member governments for final approval.
But EBRD membership is only one expression of China’s rapidly growing role in the world’s international financial institutions.
The question now is whether China will spur change within them, or vice versa.
The global financial crisis shook up the international financial architecture, catching many institutions off guard.
The International Monetary Fund, for example, had actually pursued sharp downsizing in the preceding years.
But it also allowed them to prove their mettle.
Many of them – not least the IMF, but also the EBRD and the European Investment Bank – eventually showed that they could respond flexibly and, as a result, have gained expanded mandates and more capital.
The crisis also undermined the legitimacy of the G-7 – the countries at the root of the problem – while invigorating the G-20.
Amid these transformations, China gained an opening to boost its global influence – one that it is determined to exploit, despite resistance from some corners.
It plans to use its presidency of the G-20 in 2016, for example, to advance an ambitious agenda.
In fact, Chinese international engagement is now occurring on a scale and at a rate never seen before.
China is a member of many multilateral institutions – including several regional players like the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) – with which it is deepening its relationships, especially through co-investment in projects around the world.
For example, China significantly ratcheted up its commitment to the AfDB last year through the $2 billion Africa Growing Together Fund.
Similarly, China’s sovereign wealth funds have served as important anchor investors in the vehicles designed by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and the EBRD to bring long-term institutional capital into their projects.
One of those funds, SAFE, is currently the only investor in the EBRD vehicle – and China has not even formally joined the organization yet.
China is also forging new institutions.
The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) captured global headlines earlier this year, not just because of strong US resistance, but also because countries like Britain and Germany joined anyway.
China also played a leading role in the formation, with its BRICS counterparts (Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa), of the New Development Bank (NDB), now headquartered in Shanghai.
Then there is China’s $40 billion Silk Road Fund, intended to support the infrastructure projects needed to underpin President Xi Jinping’s “one belt, one road” strategy, which aims to improve trade and communication linkages across Eurasia.
China’s most ambitious effort to date, the Silk Road Fund dwarfs the activities of the more traditional international financial institutions, in terms of both scale and range of activities.
The Fund’s first initiative, the $1.65 billion Karot hydropower dam in Pakistan, will entail both direct lending to the project and equity investment in the company responsible for building the dam and managing it for 30 years.
As it stands, the Silk Road Fund is unilateral, placing it in the same category as the China Development Bank and the state-owned investment conglomerate CITIC.
But the Chinese authorities have said that it is open for others to join, though that seems unlikely, given the scale of the Chinese commitment.
Despite the remarkable size of China’s investment projects, the country’s leaders have so far remained relatively conservative in terms of institutional innovation.
Over the last year, however, Chinese Communist Party officials have mooted a proposal for a more experimental new multilateral financial institution geared toward “restoring the environment” – that is, supporting large projects aimed at land reclamation, water purification, and improvements in air quality.
Getting such an institution off the ground will not be easy, given the need for global coordination to bring potential shareholders together and for large subsidies to make investments viable.
But that kind of bold institutional innovation could fill an important gap in the global financial architecture, and cement China’s leadership in financing environmental remediation.
In the meantime, Chinese institutions are innovating on a smaller scale, as they spearhead a leaner and faster approach to financing.
For example, the AIIB’s inaugural president, Jin Liqun, has announced plans to eliminate some of the most inefficient features of existing institutions, like the resident board and nationality restrictions on hiring.
Nonetheless, China’s growing global financial role is not likely to change profoundly how existing institutions operate.
Of course, as efforts like Jin’s highlight the flaws in existing structures, they may help to inspire reform.
And the EBRD can undoubtedly benefit from China’s experience with experimentation and scaling up.
But the main aim of the AIIB and the NDB seems not to be to transform the multilateral financial landscape, but to add capacity, while showing that China can build state-of-the-art institutions.
And when it comes to the EBRD, China’s stake will be tiny, at least at first; the Chinese say they are there to learn.
Indeed, co-investment with the EBRD can provide Chinese companies with local knowledge – and potentially even protection – as they navigate new markets.
For now, increased engagement in multilateral institutions seems likely to change China more than it changes the institutions, even as China’s voting power increases to reflect better its growing contributions.
A closer look at the experiences of long-standing institutions – including working with civil-society groups and promoting local ownership of policies – will help China hone its strategy for engagement in Africa and elsewhere.
It may even enable China to improve its own development model.
In the longer term, however, the development challenges that China faces at home – particularly rapid environmental deterioration – could drive it to take a more transformative role, pushing for institutional innovation globally.
In Darwin’s Place
BERKELEY – Imagine that, as a young scientist, you spent years collecting information about the foundations of how nature works.
You built your reputation by collecting plants, animals, fossils, and geological samples from around the world, and sending back letters that tracked your development into a first-rate scientist.
By the time you returned from a great five-year voyage, you were surprised to find that you were a rising star.
Throughout your trip, and in the years afterward, the mists that had obscured some incredibly simple yet powerful natural explanations lifted.
You came to realize that you were in virgin intellectual territory.
Your academic mentors and the scientists whose works you had read were continuing to stumble over grand problems that now seemed, if not solved, at least soluble. 
People had been talking about evolution for decades, but you have come up with a mechanism – natural selection – that just might explain much of it.
You realize that to reveal what you’ve come to understand will not only revolutionize your science, but will potentially shatter many of your countrymen’s religious and philosophical foundations.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
These were the circumstances in which Charles Darwin found himself in the late 1830’s and early 1840’s, when he developed the principle of natural selection and its revolutionary implication: all the Earth’s life forms could have evolved from a single common ancestor.
His was one of the most brilliant insights in the history of science: a mechanism that enabled the principle of evolution to unify and inform all of biology.
Just for a minute, put yourself in his place.
How would you feel?
(“It is like confessing a murder,” he wrote at the time.)
Here’s the translation to today’s world: your discovery might win you the Nobel Prize, but it also might get you a bullet in the brain from a religious fundamentalist.
How do you feel about publishing now?&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, at roughly the same time you finish drafting the first summary of your ideas, a book, written by an anonymous author, appears that also purports to explain how life might have changed through time, and considers some of the mechanisms that may underlie this grand history.
Have you been “scooped”?&#160; 
No, the author has many of his facts wrong and goes beyond reasonable speculation, which brings him disdain from scientists.
Predictably, he fares as poorly with religious leaders, some of whom accuse him of blasphemy.
And he hasn’t independently reached your new ideas – the ideas that matter. 
But you empathize with his position: you will be pilloried in the same way if you don’t nail down your theory with the best arguments possible and marginalize your opponents so that they have neither theological nor scientific reasons to attack you.
So you wait to publish.
Years roll by.
You gather data, do experiments, read, and write.
Your book becomes bigger.&#160; Impossibly big.
It is a good thing you do not have to work for a living.
Then, a bolt from the blue.
A letter from an old colleague in Southeast Asia with whom you’ve corresponded for years, attached to a manuscript that lays out your whole theory of natural selection in a nutshell.
He’s asking you, as a well-connected man of science, whether you would communicate his paper to the Linnean Society of London for reading and possible publication, if you think his arguments meritorious.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
You are unsure about what to do.
He’s scooped you on your main idea, although he hasn’t thought through the implications, or worked out all the other ideas that comprise your theory.
You don’t want to lose your investment.
You want credit where it’s due, and you want to control the game, because you have so much more to show and to support your arguments.&#160; 
So you consult scientific colleagues who have known for years how you’ve been developing your theory.
They agree that it is fair to broker an arrangement with your correspondent to publish together.
This appears to satisfy everyone, but it puts you in panic mode. 
Now you have to publish your entire theory right away, before someone else gets the credit.&#160; It nearly kills you, but you get the book out – only an abstract of the  magnum opus that you had planned – by the end of the next year.
You call it  The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . 
The reaction is immediate: 1,200 copies are published, and they sell out immediately.&#160; There are welcome reviews from scientists, but also sharp broadsides from religious people.
Serious criticism comes from unexpected places: philosophers you knew and learned from, scientists to whom you had entrusted your priceless collections to describe.
And yet: the genius of the argument is seen. 
Natural selection as a theory becomes a proposition in play, needing much more work.
But almost no serious intellectual can continue to doubt the common ancestry of all living things.
You’ve changed the world: people will never again look at all species as fixed entities, but as part of a single tree of life.&#160; How do you feel?
In Defense of International Justice
MEXICO CITY – Not long after I took office as Mexico’s foreign minister in 2001, a novel problem came across my desk.
An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism.
The officer, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the notorious Naval Mechanics School in Buenos Aires.
According to the Spanish indictment, Cavallo belonged to the operations unit of a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing people whom the military regime perceived as leftist.
The question before me was whether to extradite Cavallo to Spain, a third country, to face trial for human rights abuses committed in Argentina.
Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home.
For me, the decision was straightforward: the crimes demanded justice, and Cavallo was more likely to be held to account in Spain than in Argentina.
Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution.
I signed the extradition papers.
Since then, many inroads have been made to ensure that the world’s most serious crimes no longer go unpunished.
The International Criminal Court is up and running, and 107 states, including Mexico, have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction.
National courts, such as those in Spain, play an increasingly strong role in combating impunity through the exercise of universal jurisdiction.
The rise of these types of prosecutions has in turn motivated countries, including Argentina and Chile, to repeal their amnesty laws so that suspected war criminals can be prosecuted at home.
The trials of Slobodan Milosevic and Charles Taylor have demonstrated that even heads of state are no longer safe from prosecution.
The comfort level for perpetrators of these crimes is shrinking as the options for prosecution expand.
Whether the progress in this battle against impunity continues or slides backwards is now in the hands of the United Nations Security Council.
On July 14, the ICC prosecutor, Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the atrocities in Darfur.
Immediately after the announcement, Sudan’s government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a Security Council deferral of the investigations for 12 months.
They are attracting wider support than they should – in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers.
But the Security Council must be extremely cautious in considering any suspension of ICC proceedings.
Such a decision would be a serious setback to the movement to end impunity for the most serious crimes.
It would show that indicted warlords and dictators can avoid justice by holding the Security Council hostage to threats of more violence.
Suspending the ICC’s work in this way would undermine its potential for deterrence, one of the purposes for which it was established. Postponing the case against al-Bashir would seriously undercut the important principle – which has gradually been taking root worldwide – that no one is above the law.
The Security Council’s decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity.
That decision demonstrated, for the first time, that there was an institution that could investigate and prosecute the most serious international crimes regardless of where they occur.
Apart from being a victory for international justice, the referral was also a promise to victims of the horrific crimes in Darfur that the perpetrators of the crimes against them would one day be held accountable.
For the Security Council to step back from that commitment would do more than abandon the victims in Darfur. It would be a major blow to those around the world who have struggled to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of humanity’s most terrible crimes.
In Defense of Polish Plumbers
Supporters of Europe’s social model claim that what distinguishes it is the importance placed on “social cohesion.”
And, of course, it is as difficult to be against cohesion as it is to be against friendship.
But the real question is which policies work best.
Existing policies to achieve social cohesion are based on the belief that, if uncorrected, the free play of market forces will lead to wide disparities in income and thus intensify social conflict.
But studies tend to show that the majority of income transfers by government occur within the middle class, while only a relatively small proportion are from rich to poor.
In fact, some transfers flow the other way.
For example, many pension systems transfer money from the poor to the middle class, simply because richer people usually live longer.
What most European countries get for their social expenditure is a lot of state provision of services, and not much reduction in social inequality.
So lower levels of social expenditure could involve only a relatively small increase in inequality and social conflict.
Moreover, if Europeans target social expenditure better, they might achieve a greater reduction in inequality with a lower level of social transfers.
Indeed, some policies aimed at achieving cohesion may well reduce it.
Restriction on firing employees, for example, may protect people who have jobs, but often at the expense of the unemployed, thus increasing social exclusion.
Even where high levels of social transfers actually do reduce inequality (and therefore presumably increase cohesion), they may undermine inter-communal relations if ethnic minorities are perceived as being strong net beneficiaries.
The European Union resulted from the tragic lessons of the first half of the twentieth century, when giving free rein to national egoism led to continental catastrophe, and increasing globalization means that economic, internal, foreign, and defense policies are unlikely to be successful when pursued exclusively at national level.
Yet we continue to believe that social cohesion can be limited to that of the nation.
European cohesion funds account for only a fraction of a percent of European GDP, whereas about 10% of national income is typically spent on social transfers.
A massive increase in European Commission spending power to achieve greater pan-European social cohesion would be politically unacceptable to the richer members, who would have to pay for it.
But neither can we accept a situation in which vast resources are spent on national cohesion, while European cohesion lags so woefully behind.
Fortunately, inequalities can often be reduced considerably without spending much money.
Nothing that the EU or its individual members can do would have as great an impact on reducing income inequality in Europe than eliminating national protectionist barriers to migration, movement of capital, and provision of services.
Doing so would reduce inequalities not only between EU member states, but also within the poorer ones.
The poorest of the poor would gain the most, while the rich member states would lose little, despite their popular fear of open borders.
For example, during the referendum campaign in France for the European constitution, the “Polish plumber” became a symbol of the threat that European integration was supposed to pose to French workers’ standards of living.
But the impact of free migration (when allowed) on French plumbers’ incomes is in fact minimal, not least because of the smallness of the new member states compared to the whole of Western Europe.
Workers’ incomes in Britain and Ireland have not fallen measurably, despite both countries’ openness to immigration from the enlarged EU.
Free migration in the EU means that Polish plumbers will not only catch up with French plumbers, but also with Polish bankers.
Middle-class people in Poland are being hit by the increased cost of the services of skilled workers, such as plumbers, and also of the less skilled, such as decorators, and the highly skilled but low paid, such as doctors.
Why, then, was the European Commission’s proposed services directive, which would ensure freedom to supply services across the Union to all EU companies, vilified as the “Frankenstein directive”?
Why was it fatally diluted by the European Parliament?
Why have demands by the EU’s new member states for freer access to Western Europe’s labor and services markets, and for the right to compete with “old Europe” for investment, been stigmatized as social dumping?
Why are policies that would do the most to reduce inequality in Europe being presented as anti-social?
What motivates the opponents of free service provision and labor movement in Europe is not a desire to ensure social cohesion, but a wish to maintain the status quo.
To be sure, change creates discomfort, and may even cause tension and conflict.
But the conservative attitudes underlying opposition to change are anything but “social,” for they would deny the poorest of Europe’s poor a chance to improve their lot.
Indeed, such attitudes are potentially disastrous.
If they came to be accepted as the guiding principles of European policy, Europe’s economy would become petrified, with stagnant growth making it impossible to afford even modest levels of social transfers.
India at Play
New Dehli – On June 1, the Indian Premier League came to a thundering climax with a cliffhanger final match, watched by 60,000 cheering fans in a new stadium and an estimated 300 million television viewers around the world.
As cheerleaders danced and waved brightly colored pom-poms, and star sportsmen from across the globe, clad in their teams’ multi-hued regalia, looked forward to a $2.5 million payday, black-market tickets changed hands for as much as $2,500.
Football?
Basketball?
No, the IPL is the newest Indian innovation revolutionizing that most staid of Victorian sports – cricket.
As the globalizing world discovers a twenty-first-century India full of high-tech computer geeks, efficient businessmen, colorful fashions, and glitzy entertainment – a far cry from the old stock images of fakirs on beds of nails, maharajahs on elephants, and mendicants with begging bowls – it is also finding an India obsessed with what most regard as a nineteenth-century sport.
Cricket has seized the Indian national imagination like no other sport.
An international match can fill 100,000-seat stadiums, while attracting TV audiences of 350 million.
Airline pilots provide passengers with the latest scores; office-goers cluster around the nearest available television.
Cricketers occupy a place in India’s pantheon rivaled only by gods and Bollywood stars.
The performances of our heroes are analyzed with far more passion than any political crisis.
In no other country does a sport so often command the front pages of leading newspapers.
Cricket first came to India with decorous English gentlemen.
It took nearly a century for the “natives” to learn the sport, but when they did, they took to it like snakes to their charmers.
Today, the public’s obsession has made India into the sport’s global financial powerhouse, with advertisers and sponsors pouring unheard-of sums into the game.
It is estimated that India alone accounts for nearly 90% of cricket’s worldwide revenues, putting the game’s traditional guardians, England and Australia, in the shade.
India has become the most influential country in the sport’s governing body, the International Cricket Council, which has moved its headquarters from London to Dubai, which has no cricketing tradition but is closer to the sport’s new fulcrum in South Asia.
In April and May, the new Indian Premier League revolutionized the sport.
By bringing the world’s top players to India at unprecedented salaries (one Australian player was auctioned to his new team for $1.4 million, more than most cricketers previously earned in a lifetime), and by spicing up the game through such innovations as American cheerleaders, the IPL is transforming the sport.
When the traditional English cricket season opened in April, as it has for the last couple of centuries, seasoned British journalists ruefully reported that while the players and officials were dutifully present, their minds were far away, following the fortunes of the lucrative league in India.
I have often thought that cricket is really, in the sociologist Ashis Nandy’s phrase, an Indian game accidentally discovered by the British.
Everything about cricket seems ideally suited to the Indian national character: its rich complexity, the endless possibilities and variations that can occur with each delivery, the dozen different ways of getting out – all are reminiscent of a society of infinite forms and varieties.
A country where a majority of the population still consults astrologers can well appreciate a sport in which an ill-timed cloudburst, a badly prepared pitch, a lost toss, or the sun in the eyes of a fielder can transform a game’s outcome.
Even the possibility that five tense, exciting, hotly-contested, and occasionally meandering days of cricketing could still end in a draw seems derived from ancient Indian philosophy, which accepts that in life the journey is as important as the destination.
So, too, is the fact that cricket is a team game that showcases individual excellence.
Indians have long been resigned to defeat for their national side (though this is changing), but they have always managed to produce individual record-breakers – outstanding cricketers like the batsmen Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, or the all-rounders Vinoo Mankad and Kapil Dev, who were considered to be among the world’s best players, even if the Indian teams to which they belonged lost more often than they won.
What offers better consolation than the thrilling endeavors of a gifted batsman or the magical wiles of a talented bowler, each performing his dharma , the individual doing his duty in a team game, just as in life each Indian fulfils his destiny within the fate of the collectivity?
In the old days, cricket was reproached as a sport played by Anglicized elites in the big cities.
But now cricket is followed by the masses all over the country.
New cricketing heroes have emerged from small towns, none more popular than India’s swashbuckling captain, M.S. Dhoni, the son of a peon in the dusty town of Ranchi, who now commands millions in endorsement fees to tout products that his family could never have aspired to own.
Cricket, once the sport of the British upper classes, is in India a great leveler.
Indeed, the sport both reflects and transcends India’s diversity.
It is entirely fitting that the Indian team has been led by captains from each of its major faiths – Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, and a colorful Sikh.
A land divided by caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom, and costume is united in consensus around a great conviction: cricket.
Thanking Bangladesh
NEW DELHI – This month, India’s parliament took the first step toward a potentially momentous decision: to settle a boundary dispute with Bangladesh that dates back to the 1947 partition of the subcontinent.
An agreement in this area would provide a major boost to the already warm bilateral relationship, not least by bolstering Bangladesh’s position in the region.
The demarcation of the India-Pakistan border by the British was a slapdash affair, concocted by a collapsing empire in headlong retreat from its responsibilities.
The border itself was hastily drawn by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a lawyer who had never visited India before receiving the assignment, and caused numerous practical problems.
In the eastern part of Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971, Radcliffe’s frontier created two sets of anomalies.
In some cases, one country refused to relinquish territory to the other, resulting in so-called “adverse possessions”; in others, Radcliffe left small areas of one country completely surrounded by the other’s territory.
With 111 Indian enclaves spread over 17,000 acres in Bangladesh, and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves spread over 7,110 acres in India, a settlement would involve a net transfer of some 40 square kilometers (15.4 square miles) of territory from India to its eastern neighbor.
That is not a huge area.
Yet it has taken nearly seven decades to make real progress toward resolving the anomalies.
At first, the hostility between India and Pakistan that arose soon after partition thwarted any discussion of the issue.
In 1971, though, Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, facilitated by India, allowed for the possibility of a solution, and a land-boundary agreement was concluded in 1974.
But a military coup in Bangladesh strained the bilateral relationship and stymied the deal.
Despite improved ties in the 1990s, successive Indian governments were unable – or unwilling – to risk their political capital by legitimizing the territorial transfer and settling the dispute.
Indeed, the one prime minister who did press for an agreement, Manmohan Singh, was met with strong domestic resistance, including from a coalition ally, making it impossible to gain enough votes to adopt the required constitutional amendment.
The then-opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) went so far as to block the bill in parliament, with the upper house’s then-opposition leader, the lawyer Arun Jaitley, arguing that India’s territory is integral to its constitution and thus “cannot be reduced or altered by an amendment.”
Now, three years after thwarting Singh’s efforts, the BJP has taken over India’s government, following its resounding electoral victory in May.
And it has reversed many of its policy positions, including on the boundary with Bangladesh.
During her first trip abroad after becoming foreign minister, the BJP’s Sushma Swaraj traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, where she pledged to follow through on the land-boundary agreement, referring it to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs for review.
The committee, which I head, deliberated over three weeks of hearings, summoning senior representatives from the foreign and home ministries, as well as the government of the most affected state, West Bengal.
On December 7, we unanimously recommended that the parliament ratify the constitutional amendment.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi subsequently announced his support for the deal.
Even Jaitley, now India’s finance minister and a prominent cabinet member, has not expressed any opposition.
And, given that Bangladesh gains the most from the settlement, both officially expanding its territory and enhancing its position relative to India, the deal should face no resistance there.
In short, the deal’s implementation seems all but assured.
The only potential sticking point in India is the perception that it is surrendering its territory.
To prevent such a misperception from hampering the bill’s passage through India’s parliament, the country’s leaders must explain to the public that neither India nor Bangladesh will be relinquishing territory that it actually controls at the moment.
The territory being exchanged comprises lawless enclaves, where the nominal sovereign lacks real authority.
In fact, India has no access to the enclaves within Bangladesh that it supposedly rules; there are no customs posts, border markings, post offices, or police to reflect India’s control.
The people inhabiting these enclaves are theoretically Indian citizens, but they lack the rights and privileges that their counterparts elsewhere in India enjoy.
Eliminating the anomalies will merely regularize the reality; the loss of territory will occur purely on paper.
The only potential change is that some residents of the Indian enclaves may migrate to India after the settlement, if they so choose.
Otherwise, they will become citizens of Bangladesh.
Given that the enclaves’ residents have presumably lost much of their cultural or personal ties with India since 1947, most are expected to remain where they are.
A land-boundary agreement’s impact would thus be most apparent in the two countries’ diplomatic relationship.
Already, Bangladesh’s Awami League government, which returned to power this year after a controversial election that was boycotted by the principal opposition party, has embraced an unprecedented level of cooperation with India on security and counter-terrorism issues.
Under less friendly regimes, Bangladesh had been a haven for terrorist and militant groups that wreaked havoc in India.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has not just denied these groups shelter; it has actively intercepted them, arrested some of their leaders, and even handed wanted terrorists over to the Indian government.
If terrorist bombs are no longer going off in the Indian state of Assam, it is thanks to the government in Dhaka.
Giving Bangladesh legal rights to territory within its own borders is the least India can do to express its gratitude.
If India is to eliminate the discrimination and indignities faced by members of its lower castes, it must transcend the politics of identity and focus on broader development goals and socioeconomic challenges.
India’s Cow Vigilantes
NEW DELHI – Indian politics continues to amaze and appall.
The surge in cow vigilantism – a uniquely Indian phenomenon that has lately begun to flourish under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government – is no exception.
Many orthodox Hindus, particularly in the northern Indian states that comprise the so-called Cow Belt, worship the cow as gau mata, the “mother of all,” which provides nourishment and sustenance through its milk – not its meat.
Refusing to eat beef is common in these states.
But it is not always a personal choice.
Several Indian states have passed laws outlawing cow slaughter, and some have prohibited the possession and consumption of beef altogether.
Cow slaughter and beef consumption are fully legal in just five of India’s 29 states, mainly in the south and northeast.
In the past, cow-protection laws have been weakly enforced, if at all; the police have better things to do than to check people’s kitchens, after all.
But since the victory of the Hindu-chauvinist BJP in the 2014 general election, a wave of religious triumphalism has swept India, bringing with it not just new cow-protection laws, but also vociferous demands for their strict enforcement.
Gau Rakshak Samitis, or “cow protection societies,” have been revived, and their members sometimes take it upon themselves to ensure that cows are not slaughtered or eaten.
Making matters worse, the cause of cow protection has now been linked to another persistent and destructive custom in Indian society: violence against Muslims and Dalits (formerly called “untouchables”).
Indeed, the Cow Belt, where cow vigilantism is most rampant, is also a hub of atrocities against Dalits, 63% of which occur in just four states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.
It is no coincidence that these are also the states where the BJP fared best in 2014.
The link between cows and Dalits is well known.
Cows may be considered holy, but they are not immortal, and when they die (ideally of natural causes), someone must dispose of their carcasses.
For centuries, that job has fallen to Dalits, who collect the carcasses, skin them and sell their hides to tanners and leather-makers, deliver the meat to Muslim butchers (where it is legal), and bury or cremate what remains.
It is a livelihood for a group with few economic opportunities – one that benefits the many Hindus who would not want to perform such an unpleasant task.
But several recent incidents have shaken the foundations of this arrangement.
In the state of Gujarat, four Dalit youths caught skinning a cow were stripped, tied, and beaten with iron rods by cow vigilantes who accused them of killing the animal (they had not).
In BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, two Dalit women were assaulted for supposedly carrying illegal cow meat (it was legal buffalo meat).
In Punjab, two young Dalits were beaten and urinated upon for the same “crime.”
A 16-year-old Kashmiri Muslim boy was murdered for having hitched a ride on a truck that was transporting cattle.
Such incidents have heightened the sense of vulnerability felt by many who do not necessarily share the vigilantes’ reverence for cows. They have also led to serious economic challenges for some groups.
Farmers who raise their cows with care and respect may not be able to afford to continue caring for those that are too old to produce milk.
In the past, they would address this by quietly selling the aged cows either to local butchers or to those who would transport them to states where cow slaughter is legal.
But, because that would be far too dangerous in the current political climate, many farmers are being driven into debt caring for old cows, while the cow population in India becomes increasingly unsustainable.
Moreover, Dalits are increasingly refusing to dispose of cow carcasses.
After the Gujarat incident, one group of Dalits in the state declared outright their intention to suspend their traditional duties.
“If the cow is your mother,” they challenged upper-caste Hindus, “why don’t you bury her?”
Where has the central government been as all of this has been happening?
Initially, it did not condemn cow vigilantism.
India’s social justice minister, whose principal responsibility is to promote the welfare of India’s Dalits, expressed regret not for the vigilantes’ violent actions, but for the fact that they were spurred by ill-founded rumors.
This view was reflected in the government’s response to an attack in Uttar Pradesh, where a mob lynched a Muslim and beat his son nearly to death, simply because they suspected that he had killed a cow.
Rather than leaping to the victims’ defense, the authorities launched a forensic investigation into whether the meat in his refrigerator was beef (it was not).
The implication was clear: violence is unjustifiable only if the victim has not actually killed or eaten a cow.
But on August 6, Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally broke his silence on the issue, warning people to beware of the fake Gau Rakshaks (protectors of cows) who are trying to create social conflict.
“All states should take stern action against these people,” he declared.
Modi’s words surely came as a relief to those who doubted the government’s willingness to stand up against its own sympathizers.
Yet cow vigilantism is far from extinguished in India.
If the Dalits allow rotting cow carcasses to pile up around the country, perhaps the stink will finally overwhelm it.
But, with Hindu chauvinism going strong, many Indians will still have plenty of reasons to hold their noses.
India’s Demonetization Disaster
NE W DELHI – On November 8, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that, at the stroke of midnight, some 14 trillion rupees worth of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes – 86% of all the currency in circulation – would no longer be legal tender.
With that, India’s economy was plunged into chaos.
Modi’s stated goal was to make good on his campaign pledge to fight “black money”: the illicit proceeds – often held as cash – of tax evasion, crime, and corruption.
He also hoped to render worthless the counterfeit notes reportedly printed by Pakistan to fuel terrorism against India.
Nearly a month later, however, all the demonetization drive has achieved is severe economic disruption.
Far from being a masterstroke, Modi’s decision seems to have been a miscalculation of epic proportions.
The announcement immediately triggered a mad scramble to unload the expiring banknotes.
Though people have until the end of the year to deposit the notes in bank accounts, doing so in large quantities could expose them to high taxes and fines.
So they rushed to gas pumps, to jewelry shops, and to creditors to repay loans.
Long queues snaked in, out, and around banks, foreign-exchange counters, and ATMs – anywhere where people might exchange the soon-to-be-defunct notes.
But, upon getting to the front of the line, people were often met with strict withdrawal limits, because, in a display of shocking ineptitude, not enough new currency was printed prior to the announcement.
Worse, the new notes’ design prevents them from fitting into existing ATMs, and their denomination – 2,000 rupees – is too high to be useful for most people, especially given that the government’s failure to print enough smaller-denomination notes means that few can make change.
India’s previously booming economy has now ground to a halt.
All indicators – sales, traders’ incomes, production, and employment – are down.
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh estimates that India’s GDP will shrink by 1-2% in the current fiscal year.
But, as is so often the case, the impact is not being felt equally by all.
India’s wealthy, who are less reliant on cash and are more likely to hold credit cards, are relatively unaffected.
The poor and the lower middle classes, however, rely on cash for their daily activities, and thus are the main victims of this supposedly “pro-poor” policy.
Small producers, lacking capital to stay afloat, are already shutting down.
India’s huge number of daily wage workers can’t find employers with the cash to pay them.
Local industries have suspended work for lack of money.
The informal financial sector – which conducts 40% of India’s total lending, largely in rural areas – has all but collapsed.
India’s fishing industry, which depends on cash sales of freshly caught fish, is wrecked.
Traders are losing perishable stocks.
Farmers have been unloading produce below cost, because no one has the money to purchase it, and the winter crop could not be sown in time, because no one had cash for seeds.
Despite all of this, ordinary Indians have reacted with stoicism, seemingly willing to heed Modi’s call to be patient for 50 days, even though it could be much longer – anywhere between four months and a year – before the normal money supply is restored.
The government’s assiduous public relations – which portrays people’s difficulties as a small sacrifice needed for the good of the country – seems to have done its job.
“If our soldiers can stand for hours every day guarding our borders,” one popular social media meme asks, “why can’t we stand for a few hours in bank queues?”
But the sacrifice extends far beyond queues.
Hospitals are turning away patients who have only old banknotes; families cannot buy food; and middle-class workers are unable to buy needed medicine.
As many as 82 people have reportedly died in cash queues or related events.
Furthermore, it seems likely that many of the short-term effects of the demonetization could persist – and intensify – in the longer term, with closed businesses unable to reopen.
It could also cause lasting damage to India’s financial institutions, especially the Reserve Bank of India, whose reputation has already suffered.
Perhaps the worst part is that these sacrifices are not likely to achieve the government’s stated goal.
Not all black money is in cash, and not all cash is black money.
Those who held large quantities of black money seem to have found creative ways to launder it, rather than destroying it to avoid attracting the taxman’s attention, as the government expected.
As a result, most of the black money believed to have been in circulation has now flooded into banks, depriving the government of its expected dividend.
On top of all of this, the government’s plan does nothing to control the source of black money.
It will not be long before old habits – under-invoicing, fake purchase orders and bills, reporting of non-existent transactions, and blatant bribery – generates a new store of black money.
Many Modi supporters claim that the demonetization policy’s problems are a result of inept implementation.
But the truth is that its design was fundamentally flawed.
There was no “policy skeleton,” no cost-benefit analysis, and no evidence that alternative policy options were considered.
Judging by the blizzard of policy tweaks since the announcement, it seems clear that no impact study was carried out.
Yet, rather than recognize the mounting risks of the non-transparent policy environment he has created, Modi has been discussing going even further, moving India to an entirely “cashless society.”
Does he not know that more than 90% of financial transactions in India are conducted in cash, or that over 90% of retail outlets lack so much as a card reader?
Is he unaware that over 85% of workers are paid in cash, and that more than half of the population is unbanked?
Modi came to power in 2014 promising to boost growth, create jobs for India’s youthful population, and encourage investment.
His poorly conceived demonetization has made a mockery of these objectives, while bruising his reputation as an efficient and competent manager.
How long it will take for India to recover is anyone’s guess.
India’s Economy after Rajan
NEW DELHI – Raghuram Rajan’s decision not to seek a second term as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, India’s central bank) was met with shock from those of us who have been cheering on the Indian economy.
While it is no secret that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had its problems with Rajan, few believed that the government would take a step that so clearly undermines India’s interests.
The government never liked Rajan’s insistence on pursuing interest-rate cuts gradually in order to promote price stability; instead, it wanted to see them slashed aggressively, in order to spur growth.
Nor was the government particularly enthusiastic about Rajan’s role as a public intellectual.
And then, in the past few weeks, a toxic and ludicrous outburst of criticism from those close to the government erupted, focusing on Rajan’s performance and his supposed lack of “Indian-ness.”
Despite all of this, there were compelling reasons to believe that Modi’s government would keep Rajan on board.
First and foremost, losing Rajan controverts the Modi government’s commitment, unprecedented in recent history, to attracting foreign investment to India.
Since taking office in 2014, Modi has spent more time than any of his predecessors selling the so-called Indian dream to foreign investors – efforts that have helped to spur a surge in capital inflows.
The recent announcement that India will now, for the first time, allow 100% foreign ownership of firms in a broad swath of industries further reinforces the message that India is open for business.
But the positive impact of these changes may be tempered by Rajan’s departure.
After all, his stellar management of inflation, which has kept the Indian rupee stable, supported Modi’s efforts to attract foreign-direct investment.
The strengthening of other macroeconomic indicators under Rajan, including swelling foreign-exchange reserves and narrowing current-account deficits, also inspired confidence in would-be investors.
Given that a key motivation behind the official behavior that drove Rajan away was the ruling party’s opposition to his hawkish stance on inflation, it seems likely that investor confidence will eventually take a hit, though it may temporarily be masked by the announcement on relaxed foreign-investment norms.
Add to that the questions about the RBI’s independence that are sure to arise, and the extent to which Rajan’s departure could undermine Modi’s hard-won successes becomes clear.
A second reason why Rajan’s departure came as a shock is that the Modi government has a record of making tough choices, rather than resorting to populist policies, in its fiscal management.
Indeed, it has displayed remarkable restraint in keeping the fiscal deficit at prudent levels.
Yet it continues to blame a lack of demand on Rajan’s refusal to slash interest rates, rather than on, say, the finance ministry for failing to raise spending or cut taxes sufficiently.
This is not to argue that interest rates could not be lower in India.
In fact, there is room for debate on that topic.
But, in forming an opinion, a few facts should be kept in mind.
First, almost all historical instances of disinflation have been associated with a transition period when growth was negatively affected.
The countries that remained disciplined, such as Chile, ended up achieving sustained growth; those that gave up, like Argentina, ended up with high inflation and no growth.
Second, in explaining low investment and job creation, there are many potential culprits besides interest rates.
The debt overhang within India’s biggest companies and the large volume of bad assets held by its biggest banks have created an unholy nexus that is blocking sustainable growth – and that cannot be offset by interest-rate cuts.
The experience in Japan, where not even negative interest rates have been sufficient to spur growth in an economy burdened by so-called zombie banks, makes this starkly apparent.
Over the last two years, the hard work of the Modi government and the Rajan-led RBI has enabled India to distinguish itself among emerging-market economies.
As countries like China and Brazil have slipped in their economic management, India signaled that it is a mature economy, where prudent macroeconomic decisions are taken based on technical expertise, not political whim.
This raised its profile in the international arena substantially.
But, following the episode between Rajan and the government – and considering the unsavory manner in which it played out – there is reason to worry that India, too, may now stumble in its economic governance.
With commodity prices recovering, risks of a Chinese hard landing growing, and the European Union facing an uncertain future, that is an outcome that India can ill afford.
Rajan would have been the ideal candidate to guide Indian monetary policy in this testing time.
Now that he is gone, one can only hope that Modi and his government ensure that the next RBI governor is of comparable caliber, with the capability – and independence – to uphold the institution’s credibility through decisive action.
Once they find one, they should remember that good central-bank governors are not dispensable.
India Embraces the Welfare State
NEW DELHI – In recent weeks, India’s parliament, often justifiably derided for the frequent disruptions that mar its work, has surprised its detractors by passing two crucial pieces of legislation that could transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
The first, the Food Security Act, grants 67% of India’s population a right to 35 kilograms of rice or wheat for three rupees (less than five US cents) per kilo.
Together with related provisions that would provide meals to infants and expectant mothers, and subsidized pulses to supplement cheaply available food grains, the law will add $6 billion to India’s annual fiscal deficit.
But it would also abolish the risk of starvation and malnutrition in a land where too many have gone hungry for too long.
The second law assures fair – indeed generous – compensation to people, often small-scale farmers, whose land is acquired by the state for development purposes.
In a country where two-thirds of the population is still dependent on agriculture and small holdings are all that a majority of Indians live on, the new law helps those who have often felt exploited and deprived of their livelihoods by the state’s power of eminent domain.
The new law requires the consent of 80% of a major tract’s landowners before the state can acquire it, and includes exacting provisions for the rehabilitation and resettlement of those affected.
It will even compensate tenant farmers for their loss of livelihoods and require that those displaced by land acquisition be offered employment in the institutions that displace them.
Detractors on the right insist that the new laws will break the budget and undermine economic growth, while opponents on the left argue that they do not go far enough in covering all of India’s poor and vulnerable. The government believes that criticism from both sides suggests that the laws strike an appropriate balance.
At a time when democracies are struggling with various models of welfarism, seeking to balance the imperative of fiscal retrenchment with alleviating the insecurity of vulnerable populations, India has moved in a direction that few thought possible for a developing country.
From the Right to Information Act, which has empowered citizens and boosted government accountability and transparency, to the Right to Education Act, which has led to record-high school enrollment and pumped resources into moribund classrooms, the current government’s reforms have changed the face of Indian society.
One in five rural households benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which provides employment mostly to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, and women in villages (in my own state, Kerala, 92% of the beneficiaries are women, whose lives have been transformed by their new income).
By raising the bargaining power of agricultural labor, the act’s passage has led to higher farm wages, greater purchasing power for the rural poor, and lower distress migration.
And sustained government investment in public health is reflected in steady improvement in India’s infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and life expectancy.
These measures cost money, but they also enable the poor to break free of poverty.
When government policies keep India’s telecom rates among the lowest in the world, it ensures that the poor can have access to a technology that increases their autonomy.
When the government promotes food security, it is part of a bold effort to strengthen agriculture, which has led to record-high production of food grains.
At the same time, economic reform has not been abandoned.
Controversial budget provisions that had earlier deterred investors are being reviewed.
The decision to permit foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and civil aviation has been pursued, even at the cost of losing a recalcitrant coalition ally.
Subsidies on diesel and cooking gas have been reduced in the face of vociferous opposition.
Pension reforms have been passed, and insurance reforms are on the anvil.
India has suffered, like most developing countries, from declining foreign investment, poor export performance, and a depreciating currency.
But even pessimistic estimates project 5% growth in the coming fiscal year, and a good monsoon should ensure a bumper harvest.
The measures that India should take to get its economic narrative back on track are the stuff of heated debate among economists and pundits.
But for the aam aadmi – the common man in whose name every party claims to speak – these debates pale in significance beside the major steps taken to build a social safety net in a country where everyone had been expected to fend for himself.
Cynics say the new measures are motivated by political considerations alone: the next general election is due by May 2014.
Before it was passed, one wit joked that the Food Security Bill meant “food for the poor, security for the ruling party, and the bill for the taxpayer.”
But it should be no surprise in a democracy that the government should pursue policies that are popular with a majority of voters.
The fiscal costs of such measures are high, but the average Indian is better off now than he or she was nine years ago.
Any government would feel vindicated by that record.
India’s Censored Fight Back
NEW DELHI – Go to see a movie in India nowadays, and despite the elaborate musical numbers and extravagant sets, you may well find the content pretty bland.
The reason is simple: the industry is reeling under severe censorship.
This flies in the face of India’s democratic tradition – and it needs to stop.
Censorship has a peculiar status in India.
When it comes to news media, print or broadcast, censorship is utterly unacceptable, even unthinkable.
Yet all films produced by India’s prolific film industry must be reviewed and approved by the Central Board of Film Certification, which has the authority to demand that scenes be cut or language changed before a film can be screened publicly.
The discrepancy is a matter of elitism.
Decades ago, the supposed guardians of India’s public morals decided that those with the education and good taste to read a newspaper can handle its contents, but ordinary people seeking diversion must be protected from the pernicious effects of the “wrong” kinds of entertainment.
To be sure, violence often makes it past the censors.
But sexuality is another story.
While images of nudity appear in urban glossy magazines to titillate the bourgeoisie, city-based censors make sure that villagers do not see a woman’s bare breast on a movie screen.
Until recently, not even a kiss could appear in a Bollywood movie; instead, as the man and woman tilted their heads toward each other, the camera would pan to two birds pecking or two flowers brushing together.
Other perceived threats to Indian culture include offensive language, gay themes, and unconventional views, especially on socially and politically sensitive topics.
Sentiments that we take for granted in the opinion pages of newspapers rarely find their way into Bollywood blockbusters.
Even on television, entertainment is subject to rules that don’t apply to news.
A fashion show, for example, would be rigorously reviewed to ensure that no non-conformist attire that shocks the sensibilities of Indian culture’s custodians makes it on screen.
Fashion channels have been taken off the air for showing models in revealing clothes.
India’s film industry has long suffered stoically under the pressure of the paternalistic censors.
But it has never had it so bad as it does under the current chief censor, Pahlaj Nihalani.
To get an idea of the scale of the Nihalani-led review board’s moral policing, a kiss in the James Bond movie Spectre was deemed too long (and therefore trimmed).
A sex scene in the superhero hit Deadpool got the same treatment.
Nihalani went so far as to declare that engaging in a long kiss “means you want to do sex in your house with your door open, and show to people the way you are doing sex.”
Needless to say, that comment attracted considerable derision.
Gay themes have also met with Nihalani’s disapproval, with the film Aligarh, about the persecution of a gay professor, receiving an “A” rating, which restricted the film to adults, despite the lack of nudity or sex.
The board demanded that the word “lesbian” be removed from another film.
Last month, Nihalni’s reign of cultural terror came to a head, with the review board demanding 72 cuts from the big-budget Bollywood film Udta Punjab (“Flying Punjab”), a gritty tale centered on the drug culture that is prevalent in the eponymous northwestern Indian state.
That decision was, it seems, entirely political.
Punjab is controlled by India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, in alliance with a powerful regional party, the Shiromani Akali Dal, neither of which was pleased by the film’s portrayal of the state they rule.
And, unsurprisingly, the cuts largely targeted scenes and dialogue highlighting the government’s failure to curb – and some politicians’ complicity in promoting – Punjab’s widespread drug abuse.
To add insult to injury, the censors asked the filmmakers to remove all 94 references to Punjab in the film, including from its title.
“All the characters are negative,” Nihalani reportedly said.
But when he declared that the film would “hurt the whole community,” what he really meant was that it would hurt the BJP and its allies.
(Nihalani, a BJP appointee, had made a campaign video for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.)
The fact that the cuts would have gutted the film – as if Woody Allen were forced to remove Barcelona from Vicky Cristina Barcelona – was apparently irrelevant.
But Nihalani failed to reckon with Udta Punjab’s feisty producer, Anurag Kashyap, a luminary of Bollywood’s avant-garde.
Kashyap launched a Twitter attack on Nihalani, calling him a “dictatorial man” and an “oligarch” – and not stopping there.
“I always wondered what it felt like to live in North Korea,” Kashyap tweeted.
“Now I don’t even need to catch a plane.”
Kashyap continued his resistance offline, taking the almost unprecedented step of suing the review board – and winning.
The Mumbai High Court ordered that the film be shown with only one scene cut.
It was promptly released, and has since broken all of India’s box-office records.
The offensive by Kashyap may have fired up an already frustrated film industry, which is united in wanting Nihalani gone.
Even one of Nihalani’s fellow review-board members, the filmmaker Ashoke Pandit, accused him of undermining the body’s credibility and even of threatening to “Talibanize” the industry.
But even if Nihalani is ousted, and the review board goes back to its old ways, India will still be a modern democracy engaged in the thoroughly undemocratic practice of limiting freedom of speech, if only in the film industry.
A government-appointed committee recently recommended that the board be confined to certification (or issuing audience ratings), with the power to censor content only in rare circumstances.
The recommendations should be adopted (though the report’s approval of full bans of films by the board is unacceptable).
The practice of film censorship is yet another relic of a bygone colonial era, the values of which Indians have too readily internalized.
Nearly seven decades after independence, Indians must recognize that our democracy is mature enough to end censorship.
Breaking Down India’s Internal Barriers
NEW DELHI – Of the many economic reforms crying out for immediate implementation in India, the most obvious is the long-pending Goods and Services Tax.
So why have India’s politicians failed to enact it?
The need for a GST is virtually indisputable.
As the billionaire Steve Forbes recently wrote in his eponymous magazine, “Outsiders are amazed that much of India resembles pre-revolutionary France, with many internal barriers standing in the way of economic efficiency and growth.”
He then pointed out that a GST is critical to enabling India, like the United States, to reap the benefits of its continent-size domestic market, as it would replace the “stifling hodgepodge of local taxes” that amount to “internal tariffs on the movement of goods.”
Indeed, India has a bewildering array of subnational taxes.
For example, taxes on commerce among India’s states require checkpoints at their borders, with long queues of trucks awaiting clearance.
As a result, shipping freight across the country is a logistical nightmare.
Sales taxes vary, and are augmented by “octroi” taxes on cross-border shipments of goods destined for local consumption.
Whereas the European Union is 28 sovereign countries with one common market, the Indian Union is one sovereign country with 29 separate markets.
Making matters worse, India’s multiple taxes and tax authorities create more opportunities for corruption and tax-avoidance.
A national GST would eliminate these problems.
For businesses, particularly those that have to transport goods across the country, the GST would be a boon.
It is estimated that the GST’s passage would add 1-2% to India’s GDP instantly.
So what is holding up the GST’s implementation?
In short, politics.
The GST was first introduced seven years ago by the Congress-led government in power at the time.
But it was delayed because of the fierce opposition of Narendra Modi, then-Chief Minister of the western state of Gujarat.
When Modi became Prime Minister last year, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suddenly recognized the virtues of a GST, embracing the bill with great fanfare, but also with important amendments.
Pandering to BJP governments in Gujarat and Maharashtra, which claimed that, as “producer” states, they would lose out from a GST, Modi revised the bill to grant states the right to levy an additional 1% tax on outgoing goods.
And yet the bill already provides for states to be compensated for five years for any loss of revenue from the application of GST.
The change – a breathtaking act of petty politics – controverts the very spirit and intent of the GST.
If states were levying individual taxes on top of the GST, the national market would again be divided and distorted, with checkpoints returning on state frontiers to assess the value of the goods on their way out.
In short, India would be back to square one.
It gets worse.
In another act of political appeasement, the BJP government has introduced a number of exemptions.
By omitting alcohol, tobacco, petroleum products, and electricity – which together account for more than a quarter of all tax receipts – the government is significantly diluting the GST’s potential impact on the national economy.
Moreover, the BJP government has increased so many other taxes (which it simply should have eliminated) that the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy estimates that the GST would have to amount to as much as 27% to prevent revenue loss.
Far from reviving the economy, such a rate would cripple it.
Overall, the current government’s gutted version of the GST would, by some estimates, have no measurable effect on GDP at all.
The Congress party, now in opposition, refuses to support the adoption of the GST bill until the more effective version is restored.
It wants to abolish the extra 1% tax levied by the states and bring all kinds of goods within the GST’s ambit.
In order to reduce incentives for avoidance and thus augment revenues, Congress also wants to cap the GST at 18%.
And, to ensure fairness, it seeks the restoration of the GST Disputes Settlement Authority provided for in the original bill, so that the GST council administering the tax would not rule on its own decisions.
There are a few more minor objections, but these are the core issues holding up the adoption of the GST.
Instead of addressing these legitimate problems, Modi is accusing Congress of unconstructive opposition by thwarting reforms that it had once advocated.
But Congress will not back down, insisting that it will not allow the bill to pass through the upper house of parliament, where the BJP does not have a majority, until the government accepts the key amendments.
The resulting stalemate means that Modi’s plan to roll out the new tax at the start of the next fiscal year, on April 1, 2016, is probably dead in the water.
Some will see in this contretemps proof of the age-old argument that India’s democracy is an obstacle to development.
After all, it was democracy – specifically, the pressure to maintain adequate support – that led the Modi government to hollow out the GST concept.
And it is democracy – that is, the need to secure adequate support for the bill in parliament – that is enabling Congress to block any further progress until Modi relents.
These kinds of problems do not arise in top-down autocracies like China and Singapore.
Nonetheless, India is right to organize itself this way.
Its system of governance rests on the belief that an integrated process of bargaining, disagreement, reflection, and compromise – not top-down unchallenged decision-making – is the most effective route to wise, fair, and successful policymaking.
The GST bill that eventually emerges from this standoff will be better for having gone through these detailed, if time-consuming, debates.
When it is finally adopted, the chances that it will transform the Indian economy for the better are high.
India’s Economic Hotspots
MUMBAI – India’s economy could soon be on the move again.
The new government is re-establishing fiscal discipline and energizing the bureaucracy, fueling optimism that rising business confidence will re-activate investment, particularly in infrastructure.
But India’s overall growth prospects conceal a patchwork of economic opportunities that exist within states, districts, cities, and even towns – opportunities that companies can uncover only with careful research.
India’s economic data are promising.
Annual average GDP growth is forecast to range from 6.4% to 7.7% until 2025.
This compares favorably with last year’s 4.7% rate, and is close to the 7.7% average recorded in the decade up to 2012.
Moreover, it contrasts sharply with the expectations of secular stagnation in the developed world.
This acceleration would place India among the world’s fastest-growing large economies and increase the number of Indian consumers who can afford discretionary items from 27 million in 2012 to 89 million in 2025.
But the potential is far from uniform.
According to a new report, more than half of India’s GDP growth between now and 2025 will come from just eight states (Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttarakhand), home to just 31% of the country’s population.
Along with four dynamic city-states (New Delhi, Goa, Chandigarh, and Pondicherry), these states will be home to 50 million consumers, or 57% of the country’s middle-class households.
Indeed, per capita GDP in India’s highest-performing regions could grow to twice the national level.
This reflects several factors, including rapid urbanization, sustained investment in skills and infrastructure, and a shift from agriculture to industries such as automotive components, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, financial, and IT-enabled services.
By 2025, the economies of these regions will resemble those of middle-income countries.
Maharashtra’s consumer market of 128 million will wield purchasing power similar to that now seen in Brazil.
New Delhi’s 22 million people will boast living standards similar to today’s Russia.
Slightly less dramatically, though still significant, per capita GDP in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, based on current trends, is forecast to reach 0.7-1.2 times the national average by 2025, swelling the number of middle-class consumers four-fold, to 16 million.
By contrast, the weakest-performing states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand, with per capita GDP of under 0.7 times India’s average, will struggle with low incomes and high population growth, unless they improve their governance and investment trajectory significantly.
But investors seeking the best growth opportunities will have to search beyond states’ headline figures and scrutinize India’s districts more closely, especially urban clusters and their hinterlands.
We have identified 49 such high-growth clusters, located in 183 districts nationwide.
In 2012, these areas accounted for half of India’s population, 70% of its GDP, and 71% of consumers.
They are also home to 250 of India’s 450 cities with populations above 100,000.
Interestingly, one-third of these clusters can be found in states that have delivered low to medium economic performance, or are located close to smaller, lesser-known towns in better-performing states.
The Nellore cluster in Andhra Pradesh, for example, has paddy, tobacco, groundnut, mango, and sugarcane farms.
The Bikaner cluster in Rajasthan is rich in oilseed and the quarrying and production of Makarana marble and limestone.
The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.
The location of these lesser-known clusters underscores the point that investors, seeking low-cost real estate and a skilled workforce, should look more carefully at India’s economic geography when deciding where to place their operations.
These locations could eventually become knowledge-based industry or services hubs, similar to those of large Indian cities such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune – only cheaper.
As they continue to develop, India’s dynamic economic clusters will themselves need to invest in modern sanitation and water systems, education and health, airports, railways, and road links.
As such, they offer investors opportunities in many sectors, including consumer goods, financial services, housing, and infrastructure.
Given their structural advantages – including proximity to large urban centers for some – these clusters could generate some of the best returns on investment anywhere in India.
Companies hoping to catch India’s next growth wave might want to consider areas that seldom feature on investment lists, but that might offer better value than marquee destinations.
Maintaining Growth in India
MUMBAI – The global economy’s slowdown has not spared India.
Sustaining the growth that it needs to continue to lift millions of people out of poverty will require rethinking its economic-policy approach.
If India is to succeed, it will have to deepen regional and domestic demand, strengthen its macroeconomic institutions, and join in the fight for an open global system.
Diminished expectations abroad should not lead India to lower its ambitions.
Fulfilling these ambitions will require efficiency-boosting investments, particularly in infrastructure.
Every corner of the country should be linked to domestic and international markets through roads, railways, ports, and airports.
Inputs, such as energy, minerals, and water, must be made available at competitive prices.
The country should be linked to broader markets through mobile devices and broadband, and access to finance must be made easier, especially for those who traditionally have been excluded.
Plans to achieve these goals are being developed; they must now be implemented.
Moreover, human capital must be improved.
This presupposes higher investment in health care, nutrition, and sanitation, so that India’s citizens are healthy and able; education tailored to developing skills that are valued in the labor market; and the creation of jobs in firms that have an incentive to invest in training.
Achieving all of this requires that the bureaucracy focus on serving the economy, rather than – as has too often been the case – vice versa.
Promisingly, the political leadership has affirmed its belief in “minimum government, maximum governance.”
Fueling growth through domestic demand will have to be carefully managed.
As a country that does not belong to any power bloc, India cannot afford to put itself in the position of needing multilateral support – a trap into which even developed countries, like Portugal and Spain, have fallen.
There is the risk of overstimulation, with fiscal deficits fueling large current-account deficits and debts, which suddenly become unsustainable when money gets tight.
The few emerging economies that have avoided booms and busts have done so by adhering to sound policy frameworks.
Fiscal prudence is essential.
Whether India needs more institutions to control deficits and monitor the quality of its budgets is a question worthy of discussion.
A number of countries have independent organs that pronounce on budgets.
These bodies are especially important in providing budgetary estimates, particularly for unfunded long-term liabilities.
As the experience of developed countries has shown, long-term fiscal commitments, such as universal pensions and health care, can be easy to make, but difficult to fulfill.
On the monetary side, the Reserve Bank of India should focus on keeping inflation low and stable, ensuring optimal conditions for growth.
As it focuses on inflation, however, the RBI must recognize that emerging markets are not as resilient as industrial economies.
They are more fragile, and their households’ economic buffers and safety nets are thinner.
Disinflation, when necessary, cannot be as steep.
The RBI will also have to pay attention to financial stability.
This is normally a secondary objective, but it may become central if the economy enters a low-inflation credit and asset-price boom.
It will be important to remember that the central bank’s role is not to boost stock prices, but to ensure that the economy’s underlying fundamentals and its financial system enable sustainable growth.
India will run a current-account deficit for the foreseeable future, which means that it will need net foreign financing.
The most stable form of financing, foreign direct investment, has the additional benefit of bringing in new technologies and methods.
But India should not be railroaded into compromising its interests to attract FDI.
For example, India’s requirements for patenting a medicine are perfectly reasonable, regardless of what the international drug companies say.
But India must ensure that its policies are transparent, and that contractual disputes, especially over taxation, are quickly resolved.
Efforts to ensure this have already begun.
Finally, as a country that does not export vital natural resources and is dependent on substantial commodity imports, India needs an open, competitive, vibrant system of international trade and finance.
India’s energy security, for example, depends not on owning oil assets in remote fragile countries, but on ensuring that the global oil market works well and is not disrupted.
Strong, independent, multilateral institutions that can play the role of impartial arbiter in facilitating international economic transactions are in India’s interest.
For now, the international monetary system remains dominated by the frameworks implemented by developed countries.
Though this is slowly starting to change, there is a growing need for a rapid overhaul.
As developed countries struggle with slow growth and large debt burdens, their interest in an open global system can no longer be taken for granted.
Indeed, their policymakers’ attention is likely to turn inward amid growing demands for protectionist measures.
Responsibility for keeping the global economy open may thus fall on emerging countries like India.
That is why these countries must press for quotas and management reforms in multilateral institutions and inject new agendas, new ideas, and new thinking into the global arena.
India can no longer simply object to proposals by developed countries; it must put its own proposals on the table.
Our research departments, universities, and think tanks have to generate ideas that India’s representatives can use.
India can continue to thrive if it invests in physical and human capital and pursues prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
But this strategy also requires India to embrace its place on the international stage.
India’s Sacred Cows and Unholy Politics
NEW DELHI – The headlines out of India in recent weeks have often made sickening reading.
Startlingly, the central protagonist in most of these stories is that most peaceable and innocent of animals, the cow.
A Muslim man was beaten to death by a mob in a small town an hour from New Delhi in response to rumors that he had slaughtered and eaten a cow, sacred to Hindus.
Another man died after being attacked by villagers who believed he was involved in cattle smuggling.
And a trucker was killed in Udhampur, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, over rumors that he had been involved in cow killings.
Three deaths in just three weeks.
Public officials, too, are getting in on the action.
After the chief minister of Karnataka, a member of the opposition Congress party, recently declared that he would eat beef, a politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) threatened to behead him if he follows through.
Likewise, 20 policemen stormed the canteen of the Kerala state government’s outpost in Delhi, because it advertised a “beef fry” on its menu.
Kashmiri legislator Engineer Abdul Rashid had his face smeared with black paint for throwing a “beef party.”
And the chief minister of BJP-ruled Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, declared that Muslims living in India would have to give up eating beef.
To be sure, there have been plenty of other repellent stories of intolerance that have nothing to do with cows.
Two children from the impoverished Dalit community recently burned to death in their own home, in an arson attack by upper-caste goons.
A prominent public intellectual had his face blackened with ink for organizing a book release for a former Pakistani foreign minister in Mumbai.
And Hindu zealots stormed a Cricket Control Board meeting to disrupt discussion of a possible India-Pakistan cricket series (which now seems unlikely to take place).
But none of these incidents has acquired the toxicity of the assaults on those deemed insufficiently respectful of the holy cow.
Indeed, a signal illiberal achievement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP regime has been the revival of the cow as an instrument of political warfare.
And the recent spate of attacks reveals a serious problem with the country’s trajectory under Modi.
Of course, the cow has long had a place in Indian politics: the country’s constitution includes a provision explicitly urging a gradual movement toward full prohibition of cow slaughter – a ban that has already been implemented in most states.
For most of India’s existence, however, the default approach has essentially been “live and let live” – make your own choice about beef, and let others do the same.
I am a vegetarian myself, but I have never considered it my business what others eat.
Where beef was legally available, it was consumed not just by Muslims and other minorities, but also by many poorer Hindus, who could not afford other kinds of meat.
But that response was possible only so long as relatively liberal or moderate officials (including an earlier BJP-led coalition government) were in power.
The Modi government does not fit that description.
Instead, it is full of leaders who seem more concerned with what goes into other people’s mouths than what comes out of their own.
Modi’s government has given voice to a peculiar kind of Hindu chauvinism, one that embraces activist assertion of a narrowly constructed version of the faith.
It cannot be described as “fundamentalism,” for Hinduism is a religion singularly devoid of fundamentals: it lacks a single sacred book, a single version of divinity, and even the equivalent of a Sabbath day.
In fact, Hindus who eat beef can, like those who abjure it, find support for their beliefs in the religion’s ancient texts and scripture.
Rather, what Modi’s government has fostered is a form of subjective intolerance, with supporters, emboldened by the BJP’s absolute majority, imposing their particular view of what India should be, regardless of whom it hurts.
The state of Maharashtra’s recent beef ban – which threatens the livelihoods of a million Muslim butchers and truckers – would not have been imposed by any previous state government or supported by any previous administration in New Delhi.
Such bans are not really about beef, but about freedom.
Indians have generally felt free to be themselves, within their dynamic and diverse society.
It is that freedom that the BJP’s representatives and followers are challenging today.
The good news is that a backlash has already emerged.
Nearly 40 distinguished authors and poets have returned their prestigious Sahitya Akademi (Literary Academy) awards to protest the silence of the academy and other government bodies following the killing of three intellectuals by suspected Hindu hardliners.
A top scientist has now followed suit, returning his Padma Bhushan, the government’s third-highest honor.
As these gestures highlight the explosion of Hindu chauvinism, support for Modi has begun to erode.
When Modi came to power, foreign observers lauded him as just the kind of decisive, business-minded economic reformer that India needed in order to fulfill its massive potential.
During the election campaign, he seemed to recognize that achieving good economic results was more important than the politics of religious identity for which his party had been notorious.
To the dismay of many, Modi has underperformed economically, while the zealots have run amok, hijacking his development agenda.
And his silence in the face of it all confirms what many in India had feared: his economic sloganeering was merely a ploy to secure power.
Now that power is becoming a tool of the unsavory agenda pursued by the Hindu chauvinists who enabled his rise.
As a result, divisive politics is now overwhelming constructive economic policymaking.
Unfortunately for India, this is likely to continue until the cows come home.
India, Iran, and the Case for Double Standards
All but lost in the controversies surrounding Iraq and Iran is a major initiative involving a third “I” country: India.
Sometime this year, the United States Congress is likely to vote on the “US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative,” signed when President Bush visited New Delhi in March.
The agreement paves the way for American exports of nuclear technologies and materials for use in India’s civilian nuclear program.
In return, India has pledged to open 14 of its 22 existing and planned nuclear power reactors, as well as all future civil reactors, to international inspection.
The agreement matters for at least two reasons.
First, the accord symbolizes the arrival of a new geopolitical relationship between the world’s two largest democracies that were often on opposite sides during the Cold War.
This development may be of historic importance if it not only leads to a deepening of US-Indian technical and economic ties, but also strengthens their ability to tackle regional and global challenges, ranging from the proliferation of nuclear weapons to climate change.
But the proposed US-India accord is attracting notice for a second, and far more controversial, reason: concern that it could weaken, rather than advance, efforts to resist the further worldwide spread of nuclear weapons.
Critics charge that the agreement undermines the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by letting India have its cake (nuclear weapons) and eat it, too (by giving it access to nuclear fuel and technology).
They allege that the agreement creates a double standard, according to which only some countries may possess nuclear weapons.
To be fair, the critics are right, at least in part.
There is a double standard at work.
But there is nothing new about that.
The NPT, some four decades old, is based on a double standard that gives only five countries – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US – the right (for how long is not defined) to possess nuclear weapons.
Moreover, the world seems to have learned to tolerate the reality that three other countries – Israel, India, and Pakistan – also possess nuclear weapons.
Where the critics of the proposed US-India accord are wrong is in charging that such a double standard is wrong when it comes to India because it opens the way for countries such as North Korea and Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
Not all countries are equal.
India is a democracy.
Transparency and the rule of law are the norm, and its government does all it can to fight terrorism.
There is no reason to believe that India will promote the spread of nuclear fuel, technology, or weapons to any other party or country; on the contrary, it is committed to preventing this.
This is not true of either North Korea or Iran.
The former is arguably the most closed, tyrannical, and militarized society in the world, with a long record of irresponsible exports of dangerous technologies.
Iran offers official support to terrorists and its president has threatened publicly to destroy Israel.
The world has good reason to be far less tolerant of what North Korea or Iran do in the realm of nuclear weapons and to reject their calls for equal treatment with India.
Indeed, if there is a danger in the proposed US-India accord, it is the possibility that either North Korea or Iran might conclude that it is only a matter of time before the world comes to accept their nuclear status.
Here the US and others must disabuse them.
The message seems to have gotten through to North Korea; we have seen no nuclear weapons test, despite its probable ability to so.
China, the transit route for most of what goes enters and leaves North Korea, understands that were North Korea to cross this red line, it would risk US military reprisal and possibly lead Japan and/or South Korea to rethink their nuclear weapons policy.
None of these outcomes is in China’s strategic interest.
Unfortunately, there is no country in a position to influence Iran to the extent that China can influence North Korea.
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that oil prices are already at a record high, while US ground forces are busy in Iraq, thus reducing the credibility of American military threats to Iran.
Iran’s leaders, though, would be unwise to proceed with an unconstrained nuclear program and discount the possibility of US military action.
This said, a US preventive strike at Iran’s nuclear-related installations is not in the interest of either country.
The potential for loss of life, for Iranian retaliation, and for global economic disruption is high.
Both countries – indeed, the world – would be better served by a diplomatic outcome in which Iran accepted severe limits on any independent uranium enrichment activity it could undertake and agreed to place all of its nuclear-related facilities under highly intrusive international inspection in exchange for economic benefits and security assurances. Better yet would be if Iran turned to Russia or the IAEA for uranium-generated electrical power.
Direct US-Iran talks should be convened if they are required to bring about any such agreement.
Iran’s calculations will not be affected by what happens between the US and India.
Rather, Iranian policy will be shaped by its domestic politics, by the ability of the international community to present a united front, and by the willingness of the US to put forth a reasonable diplomatic offer against the backdrop of sanctions and potential military strikes should diplomacy fail.
The stakes could hardly be greater.
It is Iran, not India, that we should all be worried about.
Modi’s Chauvinism Problem
NEW DELHI – As the New Year dawns, it has become increasingly clear that India’s new government faces a dilemma entirely of its own making – one that its predecessor never had to confront.
Narendra Modi’s election as Prime Minister in May 2014 was initially hailed worldwide as marking the advent of a more business-friendly government in the world’s largest democracy.
Encouraged by Modi’s pro-market sound bites – he vowed to “replace red tape with a red carpet,” declared that the government has “no business” in business, and campaigned on the slogan “Make in India” – investors rushed to praise him as a new messiah of development.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gained the first absolute majority in the lower house of parliament in a quarter-century, thereby freeing it from the pressures and constraints of coalition governance.
Modi’s trips abroad brought talk of new business opportunities, a wave of foreign investment, and joint ventures.
He vowed to improve India’s ranking in the World Bank’s global “Doing Business” report, from a dismal 142nd place to at least 50th.
Such talk continues, but it seems increasingly removed from the BJP’s central preoccupations.
In fact, Modi rose to power at the head of a family of right-wing organizations that largely do not share his economic priorities, and that are obsessed with so-called “cultural nationalism” – which is essentially just repackaged Hindu chauvinism.
The tension between Modi’s avowed economic reformism and the cultural nativism that animates his government’s electoral base is a major impediment to progress.
After all, the political majority that Modi needs to pursue his economic policies depends on the organizational capacity of the very people whose chauvinism is undermining him.
In fact, Modi’s rise was followed almost immediately by a series of attacks on India’s minorities, particularly Muslims.
A legislator from Shiv Sena, a far-right regional party allied with the BJP, forced a Muslim cafeteria employee to eat bread during the Ramadan fast.
A more tragic fate befell a young Muslim tech worker in Pune, who was beaten to death in “retaliation” for a defamatory social-media post with which he had no connection.
Then came a nationwide scare about “love jihad” – an alleged Muslim ploy to make India a Muslim-majority country by seducing Hindu girls into romantic entanglements that would lead to their conversion to Islam.
No sooner had this BJP-fueled hysteria been widely dismissed – Muslims comprise 13% of India’s population, and there have been only a handful of such marriages – than the inflammatory rhetoric mounted.
A prominent Modi supporter declared that all Indians had to acknowledge that they were culturally Hindu.
A member of the Council of Ministers divided the country into Ramzada (believers in the Hindu god Ram) and Haramzada (bastards) – and was allowed to retain her post.
Another BJP legislator declared Mahatma Gandhi’s Hindu-nationalist assassin to be a patriot, while a fringe party in the Modi camp announced a campaign to install the assassin’s busts throughout the country.
The galloping chauvinism has known no bounds.
Modi himself made the embarrassing declaration – in a speech at a new hospital, no less – that the figure of the Hindu god Ganesh, with its elephant’s head on a human body, attested to the ancient Hindus’ knowledge of plastic surgery.
The education ministry abruptly withdrew German as an optional third language in government schools, and replaced it with Sanskrit.
And the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a volunteer organization modeled on the fascist groups of the 1920s – complete with khaki shorts and staves – declared a campaign of Ghar wapasi (“return home”), or reconversion of minorities to the Hinduism from which their ancestors had allegedly lapsed in the distant past.
The resulting controversies have convulsed the country and dominated political discourse, sidelining Modi’s economic policies in the process.
Indeed, protests by opposition parties have paralyzed the parliament, making it impossible for the government to introduce – let alone pass – important elements of pending economic-reform legislation, such as a law raising the limit on foreign-owned stakes in the insurance sector to 49%.
Yet Modi has said nothing to quiet his supporters or mollify his critics, raising concerns among investors – especially foreigners – about his ability to manage his own constituents.
For example, Lorenz Reibling, of the German-American firm Taurus Investment Holdings, had a few questions – beginning with the implications of recent anti-Christian and Muslim tirades and conversion propositions – before committing to a major investment in India.
As Reibling put it, “Conversion and ethnic/religious cleansing doesn’t ring well here in Germany particularly.
The bizarre dream of a 100% Hindu India would be an India with little or no foreign support.
That is not what India deserves.”
If Christians, in particular, are exposed to an “inquisition in reverse,” he observed, they would scale back investment considerably.
Similarly, Reibling added, Middle Eastern investors would respond to an anti-Muslim policy by cutting India out of their portfolios.
Reibling is far from the only investor to harbor these fears; indeed, he was merely expressing what his fellow investors abroad have been discussing among themselves.
The alarm bells have already rung.
Modi has found himself in an unenviable position vis-à-vis his own supporters: He cannot live with them, and he cannot live without them.
Unless he can find a way to resolve his political dilemma, hope for a “Modi miracle” in India’s economy will ebb as rapidly as it rose.
The Modi Government Turns One
NEW DELHI – India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will mark its first anniversary in office this month.
While it is too early to assess its overall performance, the overwhelming sentiment across India so far is one of disappointment.
The BJP rode to power on a wave of expectations after a decade in opposition to the United Progressive Alliance government, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress party.
(Full disclosure: I was a member of that government.)
Support for the BJP was so strong, in fact, that the party became the first in 30 years to win a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of India’s parliament).
Early enthusiasm for the BJP government was based on the perceived contrast with its predecessor.
Here, at last, was a strong single-party government led by a decisive “man of action,” rather than a fractious coalition led by a reticent octogenarian, who was often unfairly caricatured as uncertain and vacillating.
Modi was marketed to voters through a clever (and lavishly financed) campaign that portrayed him as the business-savvy leader who had transformed the state of Gujarat into a lodestar of development – and who would do the same for the country as a whole.
Attracting young people with the promise of jobs, and older voters with the prospect of reform and growth, Modi won a mandate that stunned the country’s pollsters.
Congress, meanwhile, recorded its worst-ever performance.
Since the election, Modi has energetically strutted the global stage, touting his government as more hospitable to investors and urging foreign manufacturers to “Make in India.”
Yet his foreign travels have achieved little, beyond improving his personal standing, which had suffered considerably following accusations that, as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had been at least negligent as more than a thousand people were killed in a 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom.
Modi’s domestic performance has also been underwhelming.
Although his speeches and sound bites continue to impress fans of his Hindi oratory, the gap between rhetoric and reality widens by the week.
Indeed, despite speaking eloquently of tolerance and accommodation, Modi has remained largely silent in the face of hate speech by BJP ministers and MPs that is alienating India’s non-Hindu minorities.
The BJP may preach development, but it is practicing bigotry – a contradiction that Modi could resolve only by repudiating the forces that helped ensure his electoral victory.
Likewise, Modi has not kept his vow of “minimal government, maximum governance”; on the contrary, he has created the most centralized, top-down, bureaucracy-driven, personality-cult-dominated central government since Indira Gandhi’s emergency rule in the mid-1970s.
Those who decried the alleged “paralysis of decision-making” under Modi’s excessively democratic, consultative, and consensual predecessor are now faced with a different kind of paralysis, as files pile up in Modi’s office, the only place where decisions are made.
Senior positions – including two on the indispensible three-member independent election commission – stand vacant, leaving vital institutions unable to function effectively.
Despite his talk about transparency and accountability, Modi has failed to appoint a central information commissioner, vigilance commissioner, or lokpal (the ombudsman who has jurisdiction over all corruption cases involving MPs and central-government employees).
With Modi too busy to keep up with all of the decisions he – and only he – can make, the government is adrift.
In some cases, it is pursuing blatantly contradictory approaches.
Consider economic policy.
Although Modi has declared that “the government has no business to be in business,” he has failed to question his government’s ownership and control of airlines and hotels.
Indeed, privatization of major public-sector behemoths is no longer mentioned.
Furthermore, labor-market liberalization, once considered indispensable to attract investors and promote industrial growth, is on the back burner.
Optimistic talk of reform has been replaced by officially articulated respect for “graduated incrementalism.”
Likewise, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who once derided “tax terrorism,” has unleashed the taxman on entirely new categories of victims, including the foreign institutional investors Modi is trying to attract.
Unsurprisingly, investor sentiment, which perked up during Modi’s campaign, has dampened considerably.
Modi’s government has also revealed a fine talent for announcing grandiose schemes and failing to finance them.
Worse, budgets for health, education, sanitation, and women’s security – all major talking points of the BJP’s election campaign – have been cut.
None of this has been lost on the public.
India’s farmers, for example, are up in arms, because the land-acquisition law passed by the previous government has been gutted through a series of amendments imposed by fiat (which are now, however, running into legislative resistance).
More generally, voters are not impressed by Modi’s transformation from the chai-wallah (tea-seller) of the election campaign, who had sacrificed domestic bliss to serve the nation, into an omnipresent, gaudily attired celebrity hobnobbing with other bold-face names.
The nadir was reached in January, when Modi received US President Barack Obama – “my friend Barack” – in a pinstripe suit with his own name embossed in gold on every stripe.
The public, appalled by this display, promptly humiliated the BJP in polls for the Delhi Assembly, which the party had nearly won the previous year.
Needless to say, the opposition, flattened electorally a year ago, is back on its feet.
In a sense, Modi is fortunate that his government’s failings have become so starkly apparent so early in his tenure; he now has time to address them.
He showed that he is capable of learning the right lessons when he quickly auctioned the pinstripe suit for charity.
Unfortunately, the rest of his errors cannot be so easily undone.
Realizing the Indian Dream
NEW DELHI – It is not often that I get to wear two hats at once.
But that is exactly what happened earlier this month, when I spent a few days in New Delhi.
I was in India primarily as part of my current role as Chairman of a review for the British prime minister on anti-microbial resistance (AMR).
But my visit coincided with the presentation of India's 2015-2016 budget, the first under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Given some of my other interests and experiences, I found what was presented to be very interesting.
Following recent revisions to its GDP figures, India's economy has recently grown – in real terms – slightly faster than China's.
A key feature of my research into the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than ten years ago was that at some point during this decade, India would start to grow faster than China and continue to do so for dozens of years.
The reasoning is straightforward.
India's demographics are considerably better than China's, and the size and growth rate of a country's workforce is one of the two key factors that drive long-term economic performance – the other being productivity.
Between now and 2030, the growth rate of India's workforce will add as much to the existing stock of labor as continental Europe's four largest economies put together.
India is less urbanized than China, and it is in the early stages of benefiting from the virtuous forces that normally accompany that process.
But there is a catch.
When it comes to productivity, India has been a laggard.
Unless it finds a way to improve, the country's demographic profile could become a burden rather than a benefit.
In this regard, Modi's first full budget did not include anything dramatic.
But if a number of initiatives are successfully implemented, the economy should receive a real boost.
Indeed, the budget's main feature is its commitment to investments in public-sector infrastructure, even at the expense of raising next year's deficit from 3.6% to 3.9% of GDP.
I have argued for several years that India should emphasize investment spending, so I welcome this shift.
The budget also includes a number of other helpful measures, such as the reduction of the corporate-tax rate and efforts to improve the business environment.
My visits as chairman of the AMR review also allowed me to witness some encouraging signs.
In my book The Growth Map, I describe my unforgettable first visit to Gurgaon, a municipality near Delhi that serves as a regional financial and industrial hub.
Gurgaon is home to a lot of high-flying technology firms, and on this trip I visited one of India's leading diagnostics companies, SRL Diagnostic, which is developing tools that could improve the use of antibiotics.
The last time I made the trip from the Oberoi hotel in New Delhi to Gurgaon, it took well over 2.5 hours to travel the 30 kilometers.
Though a new freeway was under construction, the building site was full of cars and animals.
As a result, traffic was in a state of chaos, and it was impossible for any roadwork to be done.
I had always promised myself that the next time I took the trip, I would somehow repeat the exact journey.
I am pleased to say that the drive now takes less than an hour and the experience was much less dramatic.
Moreover, the hotel car that made the journey provided free Wi-Fi – the first time I have come across this anywhere in the world.
It is probably too early to say with certainty that India will soon take its place as the world's third largest economy, behind China and the United States.
But, given that India's investment climate seems to be improving, that moment might not be too far away.
By 2017, India could surpass Italy and Brazil to become the world's seventh largest economy; by 2020, there is a reasonable chance that it will overtake France and the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest.
Overtaking Germany and Japan, however, will require bolder steps, especially regarding education, health, and economic policy.
India will need to improve its education system dramatically, both at the secondary and tertiary level, and make similarly large advances in basic sanitation (not to mention implementing my review's recommendations for combating AMR).
These developments, along with a more stable framework for monetary and fiscal policy, could lead to the type of double-digit growth that China has enjoyed for the past three decades.
It is up to India's policymakers to realize this ambition.
Closing India’s Technology Gap
MUMBAI – It is a notable irony that India, which produces solutions to many of the knottiest information-technology problems faced by the world’s largest companies, has benefited little from technological progress.
Fortunately for India’s citizens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi intends to change that.
The gap between India and its emerging Asian counterpart China is significant.
Whereas China has created the world’s largest online bazaar and become a global leader in renewable energy, India has just begun to explore the potential of e-commerce; IT remains beyond the scope of millions of small and medium-size enterprises; and most citizens remain cut off from the digital economy.
To bring India up to speed, Modi’s government announced in August a national digital initiative: 1.13 trillion rupees ($19 billion) in investment to bring broadband communications to 250,000 villages, provide universal mobile access, expand online government services, and enable online delivery of all sorts of basic services.
Needless to say, this will do much to advance India’s e-government ambitions.
Technology trends are helping Modi’s cause.
The rapid decline in costs and increase in performance capabilities of a range of digital technologies – including mobile Internet, cloud computing, and expert systems – make large-scale adoption a distinct possibility in the coming decade, even in relatively poor India.
These digital technologies – together with advances in genomics (supporting agricultural and medical innovation) and unconventional energy (wind, solar, and shale oil and gas) – will enable financial inclusion for hundreds of millions of Indians and potentially redefine how services like education, food allocation, and health care are delivered.&nbsp;Research by the McKinsey Global Institute indicates that, by 2025, these factors are likely to contribute at least $550 billion – and as much as $1 trillion – to India’s annual income.
The gains would be distributed among a variety of sectors, even some that currently have low levels of technology adoption.
Existing applications in agriculture, health care, education, and infrastructure can collectively contribute $160-280 billion to annual GDP – and, more important, empower ordinary Indians.
Indeed, educational innovations – such as adaptive learning and remote teaching – could enable some 24 million workers to receive more years of education and find higher-paying employment.
Mobile financial services will give 300 million Indians access to the financial system, allowing them to build credit.
And precision agriculture – using geographic information systems and data to guide planting, watering, and other activities – can help 90 million farmers increase their output and reduce post-harvest losses, with access to timely market data bolstering their incomes.
Moreover, some 400 million Indians in poor rural areas can gain access to better health care in field clinics, where health workers can diagnose and treat some ailments using low-cost diagnostic tools, expert software, and online links to physicians.
Finally, by digitizing government services, such as food-distribution programs for the poor, India could eliminate the leakage that diverts, according to our estimates, half of the food from intended recipients.
For India to derive the full potential of these technologies, it will need to dismantle barriers to adoption.
McKinsey’s Internet Barriers Index for 25 countries classifies India as part of a cluster (along with Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines) characterized by medium-to-high barriers in four key areas: infrastructure, affordability, incentives, and capability.
Even with low prices for devices and data plans relative to the rest of the world, Internet access in India remains beyond the grasp of close to a billion people.
Furthermore, network coverage and the adjacent infrastructure remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas.
And, though 48% of urban Indians are computer literate, only 14% of rural Indians are able to use a computer efficiently.
Indian policymakers should be working with the country’s tech industry and other private-sector actors to implement measures that would enable technology adoption.
These include ensuring ongoing investment in broadband backbone networks, establishing inter-operability standards, and creating a supportive environment for low-cost devices.
In order to spur growth in online-services delivery, the authorities must also address broader challenges to entrepreneurship, such as India’s cumbersome procedures for starting new businesses.
Moreover, as the experience of India’s mobile telephony sector clearly demonstrates, scaling up for massive impact requires more than start-up innovation; it also demands a regulatory environment characterized by a liberal approach to pricing, manufacturing, and distribution.
Sustaining the benefits of technological adoption and innovation will require continued investment and adjustment to compensate for its disruptive effects.
For example, the automation of knowledge work – the software and systems that are increasingly capable of performing human tasks that require judgment – could affect 19-29 million jobs by 2025.
Technology can help create new – perhaps better – jobs to replace those that are lost, but only if India’s education and training systems prepare workers adequately.
With thoughtful planning, productive collaboration between public and private institutions, and capable execution, India’s government can clear the way for technological progress.
The social and economic benefits of a successful strategy cannot be overstated.
Peace with Pakistan?
NEW DELHI – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Lahore, Pakistan, on Christmas Day brought his hyperkinetic year of global diplomacy to a headline-grabbing close.
It also raised serious questions about the direction of the highly fraught relationship between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.
Since Modi took office in May 2014, India-Pakistan relations have experienced more ups and downs than a child’s yo-yo.
The victory of a Hindu chauvinist hardliner – a man who had systematically blocked his predecessor’s peace-making efforts while in opposition and demonized Pakistan in his campaign speeches – was naturally assumed to portend a bilateral chill.
Instead, Modi invited Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration.
Less than two months later, however, the two countries were exchanging artillery fire across the border, with Modi instructing the Indian Army to respond disproportionately to Pakistani provocations.
Talks between the two countries’ foreign secretaries were scheduled in New Delhi, only to be called off when the Pakistanis, like so many times before, met with Indian Kashmiri separatist leaders.
In November 2014, at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in Kathmandu, a photograph was taken of Modi reading a brochure, ostentatiously ignoring Sharif as he walked past.
(It was subsequently revealed, however, that the two leaders had met in the hotel suite of an Indian businessman who enjoys good relations with Sharif.)
Last February, Modi again initiated a thaw, calling Sharif to wish his country luck in the Cricket World Cup, and dispatching his foreign secretary to Islamabad.
But mistrust again prevailed, and a cold peace ensued.
An unexpected meeting of the two prime ministers in Ufa, Russia, in July produced little progress, with both sides immediately repudiating each other’s statements about what was discussed and agreed.
Soon after, yet another scheduled meeting of national security advisers in Delhi was called off at the last minute, again following a meeting between Pakistani officials and Kashmiri separatists.
But, with a brief encounter between Sharif and Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris on November 30, the tone changed yet again.
Without any buildup or forewarning, the two countries’ national security advisers conferred in Bangkok in December.
Just days later, India’s external affairs minister, in Islamabad for the fifth Heart of Asia ministerial conference on Afghanistan, met with top Pakistani officials, including both Sharif and his foreign affairs adviser, before announcing that the two countries had decided to restart a comprehensive dialogue.
It is against this background that Modi made his impromptu visit to Lahore (to attend celebrations of Sharif’s birthday and his granddaughter’s marriage), raising hopes among some that the bilateral relationship may be undergoing a genuine sea change.
But within a week of the Christmas bonhomie, seven Indians were killed by militants at the Pathankot Air Force Base near the border with Pakistan.
Because such an attack was entirely predictable, it may not derail the diplomatic process completely.
But, because lives were lost, it cannot be ignored, either.
With two bilateral meetings – between the two countries’ foreign secretaries, and then between Modi and Sharif – scheduled to take place this month, we will not have to wait long to find out how much political damage the attack has caused.
But it should not be taken for granted that resuming a dialogue with Pakistan is appropriate, at least in the current context.
After all, Pakistan has not really done anything to warrant the diplomatic reward of a visit from India’s prime minister.
Indeed, it has failed to fulfill any of the minimum requirements for dialogue that Modi himself has cited.
It has not prosecuted the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai massacre, or constrained the terrorist forces that operate, with the complicity of the military establishment, on its territory.
It has not even handed over Dawood Ibrahim, the fugitive don of the Mumbai underworld.
Against this background, Modi’s unplanned Christmas excursion – which caught his own aides by surprise – seems more impulsive than statesmanlike.
Whereas such gestures are typically criticized as too little too late, this might be a case of too much too soon.
The question is why Modi did it.
While he has so far refused to share his vision for the bilateral relationship, even with members of his Bharatiya Janata Party, there are some potential clues.
During his election campaign, Modi once said that Hindus and Muslims could either fight each other or fight poverty.
Perhaps he believes that the same goes for India and Pakistan: They can focus either on their mutual enmity or on mutual development.
The day before he visited Lahore, he told Afghanistan’s parliament that he hopes “Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond,” and discussed how the region’s countries “can all prosper together.”
If this is Modi’s vision, he should articulate it to the Indian public, along with a coherent peace policy that he will pursue consistently.
But even then, there would be a serious potential hitch: Pakistan’s prime minister does not, ultimately, call the shots in his country.
The military does.
They are not impressed by theatrics like Modi’s Lahore visit, and they maintain their power precisely by sustaining a narrative that spurs hostility toward India.
Pathankot could be a signal that they are not reconciled to peace, and a reminder that they have many more arrows in their quiver.
Indians cannot afford to forget that the last time Sharif hosted a celebrated feel-good visit by an Indian prime minister in Lahore, in 1999, his army subsequently started a war with India on the Kargil heights and unseated Sharif himself within months.
As 2016 begins, votaries of peace can only hope that history will not repeat itself.
Railroading India’s Railways
NEW DELHI – Every February, the Indian Parliament performs a curious and unique ritual.
The railway minister (a portfolio that exists in few democracies nowadays) presents the “railway budget" to the lower house for its approval.
A packed chamber hangs on the minister's every word.
The practice began in the days of the British Raj, when the railway budget rivaled that of the rest of the Indian government.
Of course, railway revenues today, at $23 billion, no longer dwarf the country's budget, which now stands at some $268 billion.
But India's railways still produce other mind-boggling figures: 23 million passengers are transported daily (over eight billion per year, more than the world's entire population) on 12,617 trains connecting 7,172 stations across a 65,000-kilometer (40,000-mile) network.
And, with 1.31 million employees, the railways are the country's biggest enterprise.
In short, the railways are the lifeblood of India's economy, touching the lives of every segment of society and playing a key role in moving people, freight, and dreams across a congested landscape.
Yet much needs fixing.
India's trains carry four times the number of passengers as China's, despite covering only half as many kilometers, but still lose about $7 billion annually.
The problem is that a succession of railway ministers, viewing the trains as poor people's only affordable means of transport, have refused to raise passenger fares, squeezing freight instead.
This has proved popular with voters but disastrous for the country.
Though freight transport still accounts for 67% of railway revenues, with 2.65 million tons carried every day, the higher fares needed to subsidize passengers have deterred shippers.
As a result, the share of freight carried across India by rail has declined from 89% in 1950-1951 to 31% today.
Instead, an increasing volume of goods is shipped by road, choking India's narrow highways and spewing toxic pollutants into the country's increasingly unbreathable air.
By contrast, China's railways carry five times as much freight as India's, even though China has a far better road network.
Making matters worse, politicians have continued to add trains to please various constituencies – but without adding track.
Indeed, owing to land constraints, India has laid only 12,000 kilometers of rail track since independence in 1947, adding to the 53,000 left behind by the British.
(China added nearly 80,000 kilometers to its rail network over the same period.)
As a result, several lines are operating beyond their capacity, creating long delays.
Exacerbating this inefficiency are slow train speeds, which rarely exceed 50 kilometers per hours (and 30 kilometers per hour for freight), partly owing to the need to stop at an ever-rising number of stations to appease political interests.
But perhaps the biggest problem is how dangerous the railways are.
Aging rails, tired coaches, old-fashioned signals, and level crossings dating back to the nineteenth century combine with human error to take dozens of lives every year.
Yet the railway ministers continue to insist on their populist approach.
With the government losing $4.5 billion every year by subsidizing passenger fares, it has little money to spend on upgrading infrastructure, improving safety standards, or speeding up the trains.
As a result, the railways run out of money before running out of plans.
In the last 30 years, only 317 of 676 projects sanctioned by Parliament have been completed, and it is difficult to imagine how the railways will acquire the estimated $30 billion needed to complete the remaining 359 projects.
And if all of this were not bad enough, India's leadership seems not to recognize the challenges that the railways present.
In a country where rail passengers cannot even expect a clean toilet, let alone an on-time arrival, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken of introducing bullet trains – the latest in a string of irrationally grandiose aspirations.
A technocratic new railway minister, Suresh Prabhu, has once again left passenger fares untouched and raised freight rates.
Though, unlike his predecessors, he has resisted the temptation to announce any new trains, his plans for India's railways remain inadequate.
Prabhu's pledges include improving and expanding rail lines, introducing wireless Internet at railway stations, eliminating unmanned level crossings, creating a 24-hour toll-free number for users to phone in complaints, and installing security cameras to protect women passengers.
These improvements seem to his critics to be marginal, at best, and have left his fellow MPs underwhelmed.
Prabhu's most impressive promise – to raise $140 billion from market lenders – is also his most problematic, as he has failed to clarify how exactly the railways would repay the loans.
Given how high interest rates would have to be to attract investors, this will be no easy feat, especially because the railways currently have an operating surplus of just 6%, or about $100 million annually – barely 1% of the amount needed to upgrade and modernize the network.
It is far from clear how Prabhu's grand vision of a safer, cleaner, and speedier Indian railway system will be achieved in practice.
The railway minister has created a dream budget –though “pipe dream" might be a more accurate description.
In fact, this is in line with the Modi government's approach thus far: lofty aspirations, soaring rhetoric, and quotable sound-bites have been accompanied by few specifics, no implementation plan, and no improvements in execution capacity.
India's overburdened trains cannot run on hot air, but that seems to be what they are being offered for now.
Faster Growth Through Stronger Regulation
WASHINGTON, DC – When India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was on the campaign trail, he promised to improve the way the country is governed.
Since taking office in May, he has strived to deliver.
Recently, he declared that he wants to boost India’s position in the World Bank’s “Doing Business” survey, which assesses the regulatory climate in 189 countries.
Modi’s goal is to lift India into the top 50 – a bold ambition given that the country currently sits at 142.
Cutting bureaucratic red tape can help foster a culture of entrepreneurship and dynamism.
But putting in place an effective regulatory and enforcement infrastructure can be equally important, especially in areas where consumers have difficulty assessing the value of products and the risks they can pose.
In all countries – but especially in developing economies – a robust regulatory system is essential to building trust in the marketplace.
Consumers need to know that the food they eat, the cars they drive, and the medicines they take are safe.
Confidence in local products boosts domestic consumption and makes exports more attractive in foreign markets.
By contrast, a country riddled with regulatory shortcomings will find its arteries of commerce clogged and foreign investors spooked by unpredictable quality and unfair competition from unscrupulous producers.
In developing countries, “poor quality regulation and implementation are formidable barriers to entrepreneurship and investment,” according to a World Bank report. “Regulatory failures expose people and the environment to horrific risks.”
As developing countries upgrade their regulatory systems, they should focus on closing legal gaps that put consumers at risk and undermine market credibility.
In China, for example, the manufacturers of pharmaceutical ingredients can dodge drug regulation by claiming that their products will be used for non-medical purposes.
Even as reputable firms ensure the quality of all their inputs, this loophole can allow unsafe products to enter the market, as occurred in 2008, when at least 81 Americans died after receiving doses of the blood thinner heparin that contained adulterated Chinese material.
By the same token, regulations should be based on international standards, where they exist.
For example, American, European, Japanese, and other drug regulators have developed guidelines, through the International Conference on Harmonization, that take advantage of their collective expertise.
Countries such as South Korea and Singapore are drawing on these guidelines to flesh out their own regulatory systems.
As a result, their citizens will enjoy quick access to new medicines, and their researchers will find it easier to participate in global clinical research, a boon to domestic industries.
Because a regulatory institution can only be as effective as the people who work for it, another area of focus for developing countries should be training skilled staff.
In China, fewer than 200 people work at the Center for Drug Evaluation, the agency that reviews applications for new drugs.
By contrast, the United States Food and Drug Administration employs 4,000 reviewers, and the European Medicines Agency has 3,000.
Predictably, China’s approval process for new drugs is one of the world’s slowest – eight years on average.
As a result, patients are denied access to the medicines they need.
Building intellectual capital and institutional competence can take years, but it can be done.
A decade ago, Japan’s drug-approval process was lethargic relative to that of other developed economies.
The country made the safe acceleration of the approval process a high priority, and tremendous progress has followed.
The median time taken to approve new drugs fell from 833 days in 2006 to 306 days in 2012, according to the London-based Center for Innovation in Regulatory Science.
For regulation to be truly effective, it must be backed by robust enforcement – with sanctions for noncompliance.
That calls for a legal system that can adjudicate disputes and ensure fair, equitable, and timely treatment.
For India, which has only 1.2 judges per 100,000 people (compared to 10.8 in the US), this will be a difficult challenge.
According to the Supreme Court of India, in March 2012 the country had 31.2 million cases pending, more than 80% of them in lower courts.
Such extraordinary backlogs have persisted – and can undermine the rule of law.
The world’s richer countries created their regulatory infrastructure over generations, during a time when there was little direct global competition.
Emerging markets need to create theirs in a greatly compressed timeframe.
This will not be easy anywhere.
It will require significant resources, and the process risks angering domestic companies that have become accustomed to a lack of regulatory oversight.
But, if implemented correctly, sound regulation can strengthen countries’ growth capacity, while protecting citizens and improving their long-term living standards.
Clicks over Bricks in India
SINGAPORE – After years of debate, India’s government recently announced that will open the country’s retail sector to foreign investment.
The move was met with howls of protest from those who argue that the entry of large hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Walmart will devastate the small shops that currently dominate India’s retail sector.
A country-wide strike called by opposition parties on September 20 brought many cities and towns to a halt.
So far, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government has not relented, despite the loss of support from a key coalition ally.
The debate around opening the retail sector to foreign investment is currently being framed, on the one hand, by the need to modernize supply chains and, on the other hand, by the desire to protect small shopkeepers’ livelihoods.
Those who support the decision argue that India’s supply chains are simply too wasteful, and that only the finance and knowhow of big, international retail chains can upgrade them.
Opponents point to how big retailers decimated the traditional retail segment in the West.
But this debate misses a crucial point: the hypermarket model is itself under serious threat everywhere from online shopping.
Consumers worldwide are finding that they can access virtually unlimited choice on the Internet – including customized goods and services that big retailers simply cannot deliver.
As a result, large hypermarkets are suddenly finding that their business model is unraveling.
They watched in horror as Amazon, en route to becoming the world’s largest online retailer, pushed the bookstore chain Borders into bankruptcy, and have wondered if they will be next.
The American discount retailer Walmart, reportedly concerned that it is cannibalizing its own sales, has gone so far as to stop selling Amazon’s Kindle tablets.
Indeed, the Indian government’s decision to welcome foreign retailers coincided with French retailer Carrefour’s announcement that it will shut down its substantial operations in Singapore by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, its British counterpart, Tesco, is shifting away from the large hypermarket format and investing heavily in online systems.
Quite clearly, the established framework of retailing is being fundamentally overhauled.
Given these developments, India may simply skip the hypermarket stage and go online, just as it skipped fixed-line telephony and went mobile.
Of course, hypermarkets will do well in a few locations, but they are unlikely ever to dominate India’s retail sector.
For small shopkeepers, this poses both a challenge and an opportunity.
The challenge is that the rise of online shopping will increase competitive pressure, regardless of whether big foreign retailers enter the market.
While Indians have traditionally been wary of buying online, owing to their distrust of digital security, in recent years the urban middle class has become increasingly accustomed to using the Internet to purchase airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms, and order books.
As rising affluence and falling technology prices make online shopping accessible to a growing pool of customers, more products will follow.
Change is inevitable.
But this shift may also open an opportunity for small shops.
We know from international experience that online shopping undermines hypermarkets more than neighborhood stores, which often offer home delivery, credit, and the reassuring familiarity of personal relationships.
A local shop may be able to use the Internet to tailor more precisely its selection of goods to its customers’ tastes.
In other words, small shops may be more than capable of holding their own against big retailers if they adapt to the new environment.
Indeed, small shops’ advantages are so compelling that Tesco is investing heavily in expanding its network of convenience stores, Tesco Express, thereby effectively mimicking the traditional model of local grocery stores.
So India’s political debate over the entry of foreign retailers into the market, while heated, is probably already outdated.
The real question is how India’s creaking supply chains will respond when consumers leapfrog hypermarkets and go online.
No other country has created a logistical network directly for online retailing.
For investors and businesses – perhaps including India’s small shopkeepers – this is where the really interesting opportunities will emerge.
India’s Agony
MUMBAI – In most cities of South Asia, hidden beneath the grime and neglect of extreme poverty, there exists a little Somalia waiting to burst out and infect the body politic.
This netherworld, patrolled and nourished by criminals who operate a vast black-market economy, has bred, in Mumbai, a community that has utter contempt for the state, because it knows that its survival depends on corrupting the police.  Like underground magma, that underworld has now burst into the streets of Mumbai.
Because the denizens of this netherworld know neither patriotism nor morality, they are easily lured into partnership with terrorists, particularly when they have reason to feel aggrieved.
In Mumbai, a large proportion of them are Muslims who were denied space in the formal economy and have developed strong vested interests over the past 50 years.
Details about the Mumbai outrage, where terrorists killed over 100 people, are still unfolding.
But we do know that at least 30 men armed with AK47 rifles and grenades held India’s business and financial center hostage, targeting both Indians and foreigners, particularly Americans and British.
It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba, a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support.
In the blood and drama of the events, however, we might miss a significant element of the story.
The attacks were an operation that must have required months of planning: serious weapons were deployed, a small army was mobilized, targets were studied, transport was organized, and weak points identified.
A plan of attack that involved hundreds of people was put in motion, and yet the massive infrastructure of India’s government discovered nothing.
The chief of India’s Anti-Terrorist Squad, Hemant Karkare (who lost his life in the battles that raged through the night) received a death threat from the nearby city of Pune, but his own unit did not bother to investigate it, since it was busy playing games on behalf of its political masters.
Complacency and politics gave the terrorists more protection than silence or camouflage ever could.
Indeed, the attacks represent more than a failure of police work.
They represent a collapse of governance; these are the wages of the sins of administrative incompetence and political malfeasance.
India is a tough nation.
No one should have illusions about that.
It has fought off Muslim terrorists in Kashmir, Sikh terrorists in Punjab, Christian terrorists in Nagaland, and Hindu terrorists in Assam and across the country.
It understands that you cannot blame the whole community for the sins of a few.
But under ineffectual governance, particularly during the last three years, India is in danger of degenerating into a soft state.
Instead of being an international leader in the worldwide war against terrorism, it is sinking into the despair of a perpetual victim.
Indeed, India stands only behind Iraq in the number of people killed each year in terrorist attacks.
Three years ago, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rather smugly told President George W. Bush in Delhi that Indian Muslims were not involved in any act of terrorism.
The implication was that the integration of Muslims in Indian society constituted a success story.  Muslims, Singh implied, also benefit from the virtues of democracy, a conclusion that Bush happily repeated.
But Singh certainly did not fool any of the terrorists, some of whom may have read his self-congratulation as a challenge for them to act.
I am an Indian and a Muslim and proud to be both.
Like any Indian, today I am angry, frustrated, and depressed.
I am angry at the manic dogs of war who have invaded Mumbai.
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi, tone-deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens.
And I am depressed at the damage being done to the idea of India.
India’s American Friends and Iranian Partners
NEW DELHI – The United States recently took the Iran-sanctions monkey off India’s back: it granted India an exemption from Iran-related financial sanctions in exchange for significant cuts in Indian purchases of Iranian oil.
Nevertheless, Iran continues to cast a pall over an otherwise brightening US-India relationship.
From India’s perspective, Iran is an important neighbor with which it can ill afford to rupture its relationship.
Indeed, India already seems locked geographically in an arc of failing or dysfunctional states, confronting it with external threats from virtually all directions.
If India joined the US containment strategy against Iran, it would have to bear serious strategic costs.
For starters, it would lose access to Afghanistan via Iran, which has served as a conduit for the substantial flow of Indian aid to Kabul.
Moreover, containment would undermine India’s energy interests.
Few countries are as dependent on the Persian Gulf region’s hydrocarbons as is India, which imports almost 80% of its consumption.
Iran is the world’s third-largest net oil exporter (with the world’s second-largest natural-gas reserves as well), and it is a strategically located gateway to other energy suppliers in Central Asia and the Middle East.
Iraq and Iran used to be India’s principal oil suppliers.
But the first fell prey to a long US occupation, and the second currently faces a US-led oil-export embargo designed to throttle it financially.
As a result, America’s efforts to give international effect to its new Iran Sanctions Act constitute a double whammy for India.
First, it threatens to sabotage India’s energy-import diversification strategy by making it overly dependent on the Islamist-bankrolling oil monarchies – including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar – which have managed to ride out the Arab Spring.
Second, further isolation of Iran will make it very difficult for India to play a more active role in Afghanistan at a time when the US is hastening its military disengagement there and seeking to cut a deal with the Taliban.
India, one of the largest aid donors to Afghanistan, has no contiguous corridor to that country and must rely on Iran for access.
Both countries share a common goal in Afghanistan – to ensure that the Pakistan-backed Taliban does not return to power.
If the already-unstable situation there deteriorates after the end of US-led combat operations, India and Iran may be compelled to revive their strategic cooperation of the 1990’s.
It was the Northern Alliance, backed by India, Iran, and Russia, that overthrew the Taliban regime in Kabul in late 2001 with the help of America’s air war.
For the US today, containment of Iran is dictated by several geopolitical considerations.
One consideration is the need to neutralize the strategic advantage that Iran gained from the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq – a development that helped to empower Iraq’s Shia majority.
President George W. Bush called Iran part of an “axis of evil,” yet his decision to invade and occupy Iraq benefited Shia-dominated Iran above all.
Moreover, regional geopolitics pits the powerful “Sunni Crescent,” led by Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, against the beleaguered “Shia Crescent” states – Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.
The US has profited from a longstanding alliance with the Sunni bloc.
In addition to the strategic advantages, America’s close ties with the oil sheikhdoms – which are among the world’s leading holders of foreign-exchange reserves – contribute to propping up the dollar.
It is against this background that the Iranian nuclear program has come to symbolize the larger geopolitical tensions underlying the confrontation between the US and Iran.
Indeed, the nuclear issue has served to rationalize the face-off, with Iran’s leaders playing to their domestic audience by whipping up nuclear nationalism and the US playing to the international audience by harping on the proliferation threat.
India should seek to play the role of honest broker to defuse the threat of military hostilities, which would most likely shut down the world’s most important oil-export route, the Strait of Hormuz (a danger that Iran has said is also implicit in an oil-export embargo against it).
But, far from being able to play the role of bridge-builder between the US and Iran, India is being forced to walk a policy tightrope, and its desire to chart a neutral course has annoyed both sides.
Every time a senior Indian delegation visits Iran, or vice versa, the US warns India that its cozying up to Iran “raises obstacles” to building a closer strategic partnership.
Yet, by voting against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s governing board meetings in 2005 and 2006, India invited Iranian reprisal in the form of cancellation of a highly favorable 25-year, $22 billion liquefied-natural-gas deal.
The Iran issue, in effect, has turned into a diplomatic litmus test: Will India stand up for its strategic and energy interests in the region, or will it be co-opted to serve the short-term interests of its friend, the US?
The US, for its part, must reconcile its Iran-related pressure on India, which is likely to continue, despite the sanctions waiver, with the imperative to build deeper defense ties with India, thereby giving strategic heft to its declared “pivot” to Asia.
India’s Burma Dilemma
The world has been horrified by graphic images of the latest crackdown by Myanmar’s military junta.
But the bullets and clubs unleashed on Buddhist monks have worked.
The monks have retreated, and an eerie normalcy has returned to Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar’s principal city and former capital.
That crackdown continues under cover of darkness.
When the sun sets in Myanmar, fear rises.
Everyone listens half awake for the dreaded knock on the door.
Any night, the military’s agents can come for you, take you away, and make sure you are never heard from again.
In recent nights, the junta’s henchmen have burst into monasteries, lined up sleepy monks, and smashed their shaved heads against the walls, spattering them with blood.
Scores of others, perhaps hundreds, have been carted off for interrogation, torture, or execution.
The nighttime assault on a United Nations employee and her family made international news, but hundreds of less well connected Burmese have been similarly abused.
For 45 years, Myanmar’s people have been subjected to the junta’s reign of terror.
My father was born in Rangoon long before the 1962 coup that brought the current regime to power.
Afterwards, many of my relatives, prosperous Indian merchants who had been settled in Myanmar for generations, abandoned homes and businesses in order to save their skins as chaos enveloped the city, later renamed Yangon.
A relative who now lives in Bangkok, but who returned part-time to Yangon in response to overtures from Myanmar’s cash-starved rulers, recalled those days: “We lived through hell.
We never knew when we woke up each morning what would happen.
People were being denounced left and right.
They could just come and take you away and take everything away from you.”
Those who couldn’t leave Myanmar, or didn’t want to, have lived with this fear ever since.
The United States and Europe have issued strong statements condemning the crackdown and calling upon Myanmar’s neighbors, especially India and China, to exert their influence on the regime.
The response from both has been muted (as it has from Thailand, which also has strong economic ties with Myanmar).
China balks at interfering in the “internal affairs” of a neighbor from whom it gets precious natural gas and potential access to the sea.
India, which “normalized” bilateral relations a few years ago, is reluctant to alienate Myanmar’s military, with which it has worked closely to counter rebels in India’s northeast who had been using the common border to tactical advantage.
To this end, India has provided aid, including tanks and training, to Myanmar’s military.
But the main reason for India’s good relations with Myanmar’s ruling thugs is the country’s vast and still largely unexploited energy reserves, which India desperately needs to fuel its economic boom.
India has invested $150 million in a gas exploration deal off the Arakan coast of Myanmar, and India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gas Authority of India Ltd. have taken a 30% stake in two offshore gas fields in direct competition with PetroChina, which has also been given a stake.
India and China are simply doing what the US and European countries have done for so long: trump rhetoric about democracy and human rights with policies that serve their strategic and energy security interests.
US relations with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are two examples, and America’s Chevron and France’s Total, two of the world’s oil giants, continue to do a brisk business in Myanmar, thanks to loopholes in the sanctions.
But the rise of India and China means that the time-tested posture of Western democracies toward emerging states to “do as we say, not as we do” will become less tenable.
If the EU and the US want democratic India to act according to its stated moral values and not its vital national interests when these appear to conflict, they had better be prepared to do the same.
Feeling the heat, including threats from some US senators to link America’s nuclear deal with India to its actions in Myanmar, India has announced that it is asking for the release of Burmese democratic opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
But the credibility of all democratic regimes, not just India’s, is at stake in what unfolds in Myanmar.
India’s Dalai Dilemma
As the world reacts to China’s crackdown in Tibet, one country is conspicuous by both its centrality to the drama and its reticence over it.
India, the land of asylum for the Dalai Lama and the angry young hotheads of the Tibetan Youth Congress, finds itself on the horns of a dilemma.
On one hand, India is a democracy with a long tradition of allowing peaceful protest, including against foreign countries when their leaders come visiting.
It provided refuge to the Dalai Lama when he fled Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959, granted asylum (and eventually Indian citizenship) to more than 110,000 Tibetan refugees, and permitted them to create a government-in-exile (albeit one that India does not recognize) in the picturesque Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala.
On the other hand, India has been cultivating better relations with China, which humiliated India in a brief border war in 1962.
Though their bitter border dispute remains unresolved, and China has been a vital ally and military supplier to India’s enemies in Pakistan, bilateral relations have grown warmer in recent years.
Trade has doubled in each of the last three years, to an estimated $40 billion this year; China has now overtaken the US as India’s largest single trading partner.
Tourism, particularly by Indian pilgrims to a major Hindu holy site in Tibet, is thriving.
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai, and Infosys’s headquarters in Bangalore recruited nine Chinese this year.
India has no desire to jeopardize any of this.
India’s government has attempted to draw a distinction between its humanitarian obligations as an asylum country and its political responsibilities as a friend of China.
The Dalai Lama and his followers are given a respected place but told not to conduct “political activities” on Indian soil.
When young Tibetan radicals staged a march to Lhasa from Indian soil, the Indian police stopped them well before they got to the Tibetan border, detaining 100.
When Tibetan demonstrators outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi attacked the premises, the Indian government stepped up its protection for the Chinese diplomats.
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee – who was noticeably less forthcoming on Tibet than his American counterpart during a press conference with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice – has publicly warned the Dalai Lama against doing anything that could have a “negative impact on Indo-Sino relations.”
The Dalai Lama’s curious position has complicated India’s diplomatic dance with China.
He is simultaneously the most visible spiritual leader of a worldwide community of believers, a role that India honors, and a political leader, a role that India permits but rejects in its own dealings with him.
As a Buddhist, the Dalai Lama preaches non-attachment, self-realization, inner actualization, and non-violence; as a Tibetan he is admired by a people fiercely attached to their homeland, with most seeking its independence from China and many determined to fight for it.
He is the most recognized worldwide symbol of a country that he has not seen for nearly five decades.
The Dalai Lama’s message of peace, love, and reconciliation has found adherents among Hollywood movie stars, pony-tailed hippies, Irish rock musicians, and Indian politicians.
But he has made no headway at all with the regime that rules his homeland, and he has been unable to prevent Tibet’s inexorable transformation into a Chinese province.
His sermons fill football stadiums and he has won a Nobel Prize, but political leaders around the world shirk from meeting him openly, for fear of offending China.
Indians are acutely conscious that, on this subject, the Chinese are easily offended.
While India facilitated the highly publicized visit by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, to the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala last month, it almost simultaneously canceled a scheduled meeting between him and Indian Vice-President Mohammed Hamid Ansari.
When China summoned India’s ambassador in Beijing to the foreign ministry at 2 a.m. for a dressing-down over the Tibetan protests in New Delhi, India meekly acquiesced in the insult.
Though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has publicly declared the Dalai Lama to be the “personification of nonviolence,” India has let it be known that it does not support his political objectives.
Tibet, India’s government says, is an integral part of China, and India lends no support to those who would challenge that status.
That position is not without detractors.
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, which led the previous government) has criticized the current administration for not “expressing concern over the use of force by the Chinese government” and instead “adopting a policy of appeasement towards China with scant regard to the country’s national honor and foreign policy independence.”
But few observers believe that the BJP would have conducted itself differently.
The stark truth is that India has no choice in the matter.
It cannot undermine its own democratic principles and abridge the freedom of speech of Tibetans on its soil.
Nor can it afford to alienate its largest trading partner, a neighbor and an emerging global superpower, which is known to be prickly over any presumed slights to its sovereignty over Tibet.
India will continue to balance delicately on its Tibetan tightrope.
What’s Troubling India?
CAMBRIDGE – India’s recent fall from macroeconomic grace is a lamentable turn of events.
After many years of outperformance, GDP growth has slowed sharply.
Annual output will most likely rise by less than 5% this year, down from 6.8% in 2011 and 10.1% in 2010.
Reform has stalled amid profound political paralysis.
All of the major emerging economies face weakening external demand, but India’s slowdown has been exacerbated by a drop in investment that reflects a deeper loss of official direction and business confidence.
Even the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of a modest improvement in 2013 is predicated on the government’s ability to breathe life into a spate of stalled economic reforms.
India’s recent torpor has underpinned a remarkable shift in global opinion.
Just a couple of years ago, India was developing a reputation as the cool place to invest.
Heads of state tripped over one another to meet business leaders in Mumbai, hoping to pave the way for a significant expansion of trade and investment.
Now their interest has faded, along with the macroeconomic numbers.
And yet changes currently afoot might just turn things around.
India’s octogenarian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has recently awakened to the desperate need for renewed momentum.
Economists around the world have taken note of the arrival of Raghuram Rajan as chief economist in the finance ministry.
Rajan is a superstar academic researcher, a brilliant writer on political economy, and a former chief economist for the IMF.
But it is far from obvious that Sonia Gandhi, President of the Indian National Congress and the country’s most powerful politician, shares Singh’s reform agenda.
True, the cabinet is being reshuffled to elevate younger ministers.
But the process points to a continuation of the tradition whereby most ministers are appointed on the basis of their loyalty to the Gandhi family rather than their merit and accomplishments.
Unfortunately, for a country as poor as India, only sustained rapid growth can lead to enduring development gains.
India’s poverty rate (an indicator that is admittedly both conceptually and practically difficult to measure) fell by half between 1981 and 2010, to just under 30% – a remarkable achievement.
But faster-growing East Asia has experienced significantly greater progress, with the poverty rate falling from 77% to 14% over the same period.
Why has India’s growth acceleration fizzled?
For many years, India benefited from the long-lasting impact of economic liberalization in the early 1990’s.
Back then, Singh, as finance minister, played a central role.
He could count on the IMF – which had real policy leverage, owing to India’s need for a bailout program in 1991 – to provide external support to counter the huge internal obstacles to reform.
Today, however, there is no external counterweight to the domestic political pressure that is stalling further liberalization.
True, India’s government must now consider growing threats to the country’s investment-grade credit rating.
The major ratings agencies are increasingly complaining about the country’s lack of a growth strategy and its outsize budget deficits.
But the impact has been limited, owing to the authorities’ ability to stuff debt down the throats of captive local banks, insurance companies, and pension funds.
Indeed, this “financial repression” tax on domestic savers remains a huge opaque source of funding for India’s debt-ridden government.
It also prevents funds from being channeled to private-sector investment projects with far higher rates of return than the government can offer.
The good news is that, from an economic perspective, there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit for restoring growth.
Although India is right to avoid taking financial liberalization to the extreme that the United States did in the decades before the recent meltdown, it can do quite a lot without assuming inappropriate risks, as a commission headed by Rajan detailed a few years back.
The retail sector is a huge source of inefficiency that effectively places a massive tax on India’s poor by driving up prices.
Instead of suing foreign retailers like Wal-Mart, India should be finding ways to emulate and benefit from their hyper-efficient methods.
Infrastructure is slowly improving, but roads, ports, water access, and the electricity grid are still horrific across large parts of the country.
Of course, India’s democratic government cannot simply bulldoze through people and the environment to create infrastructure.
But the obstacles also include layers of corrupt bureaucrats and politicians – a vast network of resistance to reform.
Some argue that central-government paralysis is inevitable in a democracy of 1.2 billion people, and that the only way to re-energize India is to establish a looser confederation of its constituent states.
Devolution would unshackle the economically more successful states.
And, by combating the culture of aid dependency in economically weaker states, India’s poorer regions might benefit in the long run as well.
As dysfunctional as a decentralized Europe seems to be these days, India might benefit from moving a few steps in that direction, even as Europe itself struggles to become more centralized.
Devolution might sound unrealistic, but once upon a time so did the European Union.
If Singh’s new reform agenda is again blocked, perhaps it will be time for a more radical assessment.
India’s Hillary Clinton?
As Americans debate their readiness to accept a woman such as Hillary Clinton as president, India has already done so, with the election of Pratibha Patil.
Although India’s presidency is primarily a ceremonial post that carries less weight than that of prime minister (the position once held by Indira Gandhi), it is symbolically significant.
Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the ruling Congress Party, who pushed hard to promote Patil’s candidacy primarily on gender grounds, calls this election “a special moment for women across the country.”
Moreover, India can claim a great deal of pride in the fact that the last two presidents were from minority populations – one from the lowest of castes (Harijan, formerly referred to as “untouchables”), and another one from the Muslim community.
As a daughter of a woman who fought for women’s rights during the independence movement and was instrumental in starting one of the first women’s institutions in India, I should feel a genuine sense of pride in the election of Patil.
But at best I have mixed emotions.
Both of India’s last two presidents had distinguished themselves in professional careers before being elected – one in the Foreign Service and the other in nuclear physics – and their reputations were above reproach.
Patil, on the other hand, is a controversial figure, with questionable qualifications.
Most of India’s major news outlets highlighted in their coverage of the story charges of corruption and ineptitude.
One well-respected publication even called Mrs. Patil’s selection “embarrassing.”
Women hear over and over that we have to be twice as good as men to be perceived as successful, deserving leaders.
Even if we disregard some of the accusations against Patil as baseless, it is hard to imagine a less powerful candidate for the highest ceremonial post in the largest democracy in the world.
All the same, I applaud Sonia Gandhi for her commitment to appointing a woman to this important position.
In a country full of contradictory attitudes toward women – ranging from the worship of the powerful goddess Durga to the killing of innocent young brides – such gestures can be very powerful.
But gestures cannot be a substitute for real action, or for the hard work that is necessary to empower all Indian women.
Indeed, one could argue that such symbolic acts may even create a blind euphoria that obscures the fact that, as a result of less education and lower pay, young females in India continue to have far fewer resources than their male counterparts.
While India’s president may be only a ceremonial head of state, during periods of political instability – especially in the current age of coalition governments – it is the president who makes crucial decisions about governing parties.
Many past presidents have also used the position to throw their intellectual weight behind such important issues as education and India’s cultural diversity.
So President Patil has large shoes to fill.
One can only hope that she will prove her critics wrong.
For those women in India who have proven themselves to be effective leaders in all segments of society, it would be wonderful if she can demonstrate early on that she has the intellectual and professional gravitas that befits the position.
India Shines On
MUMBAI – Every day, a small Japanese jet brings another 60 businessmen from Tokyo to sniff out new commercial opportunities in Mumbai and the heart of the Indian economy.
Naturally, there may be a touch of geopolitical calculation about this. As Japan grows increasingly nervous about China’s rise, the case for increasing investment in the other Asian giant strengthens.
But there is more about this than politics.
Japanese businessmen may be a little puzzled by the creative chaos of India; the argumentative culture can seem alien to them.
They know, however, a chance for making good profits in a rapidly expanding market when they see one. 
And they see one in India’s glorious Technicolor – the Bollywood version of Adam Smith.
When the Japanese company Daiichi Sankyo paid $4.6 billion for majority control of the Ranbury pharmaceutical group in 2008, they were placing a bet on continuing corporate success.
Given India’s growth rates, who would seriously question their decision?
So the lobby of Mumbai’s Taj hotel, just across the road from the gateway built to welcome Britain’s King George V and Queen Mary on their visit to India in 1911, is once again thronged with visitors, many of whom have arrived to see if India is living up to its image as the next great power.
The grand old Taj deserves all the business it is getting, after being the target of a terrorist attack in 2008. The bravery of the staff in trying to protect the hotel’s clients deserves the applause of every world traveler.
The business leaders you meet in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, and the other buzzing commercial centers of India demonstrate the challenge of building national and global brands and businesses.
No wonder they have started to crowd into the premier league table of the world’s rich.
There is also an uninhibited self-confidence about them. They take double-digit growth in their own companies for granted.
The task is to push sustainable growth much higher.
Of course, they know much better than any visitor the many problems India still must tackle – social, environmental and economic, with many accompanying issues in the security domain.
If you want a novelist’s view of this world in Mumbai, read Vikram Chandra’s Sacred Games, one of the best and most exciting novels written anywhere in the last few years.
What is interesting is that Indian businesspeople no longer dwell on what India’s government needs to do.
They do not expect much from the state and are not surprised when it fails to deliver.
A government initiative is something that they seem to regard as an oxymoron.
This does not mean that they criticize the macro-management of the Indian economy very much.
They support the almost two decades of reform that have stripped away much of the “license raj.” They recognize that India has the most economically literate leadership in the world.
They expect reforms to continue, albeit at a rather gentler pace. 
They note the infrastructure improvements – airports, for example – while sighing over what remains to be done and drawing invidious comparisons with China.
But there is no impatience for a bigger government role.
It is not that they have given up on government; they are just realistic about what it can achieve.
Indian society seems to have become more globalized than its government.
There is a marked difference in tone here from debates in much of the Western world.
In many rich OECD countries, the financial crisis and recession have made government intervention popular again.
Governments bail out banks, rush to the aid of manufacturers, and claim primacy in averting national catastrophe and personal hardship.
Although increasingly strapped for cash, governments offer the solace of public subsidy.
Gone for the moment are jokes about government being the problem, not the solution.
Tax collectors used to be Public Enemy Number One; now bankers have usurped that role.
In India, by contrast, even when you might think that government should be expected to deliver more, expectations are not high.
India needs better and much more education, as its young population grows.
But, with terrible figures for teacher truancy in state-run schools – as high as 25%, according to the World Bank – families increasingly turn to the private sector to educate their children.
Many successful businessmen are putting some of their wealth into foundations that run schools and colleges.
Two big issues remain for government, in addition to keeping reform moving forward.
First, as India’s middle class expands, more must be done to ensure that economic growth is inclusive.
This is bound to involve greater redistribution if the hundreds of millions of Indians who remain extremely poor are not to become alienated from their country’s success story and pulled toward populist extremism.
The second challenge is today’s violent manifestation of this alienation: the Naxalite insurrection in rural central and eastern India.
Interior Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, a tough reformer, has this problem in his sights, but it cannot be solved by better policing alone.
Ending the insurrection will also require better government, whatever the low expectations of business leaders.
And, to be fair, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, a poor state that previously was a byword for corruption and incompetence, has shown what can be done by beginning a serious transformation of his state in just five years.
If India’s other states – and the central government – can follow this example, then the polish of India will not lose its shine.
India’s Illiterate Revolution
The United States has long been divided over what it calls “affirmative action,” a system of racial preferences intended to overcome the lingering consequences of slavery and discrimination against black Americans.
India is now becoming divided in much the same way, and for much the same reason – the emerging system of “reserved places” aimed at redressing centuries of caste discrimination.
But India’s good intentions, like America’s affirmative action policies, are misguided.
The underlying question is whether merit as a criterion for advancement is doomed when legacies of racial and caste discrimination exist.
Are those who agitate for affirmative action fighting for something that is more a quack remedy than a real solution?
In fact, India’s “reserved places” scheme operates as a deliberate smokescreen, for it allows the government cleverly to mask the real issue, which is access to primary education for India’s disadvantaged.
Were adequate primary education available to India’s poor – or, for that matter, to America’s poor urban blacks – there would be no need for reserved places in higher education and elsewhere.
Indeed, any Indian able to read this article should consider himself lucky, because India’s politicians have succeeded in keeping a majority of the country’s population thoroughly illiterate (as well as poor and unhealthy).
Instead of providing quality elementary education for all, our policymakers are more concerned with enacting caste-based measures aimed at short-term political gains.
Since India gained independence 58 years ago, billions of rupees have been doled out in numerous educational policies, but general primary education remains abysmal.
According to a report released by the National Institute for Educational Planning Administration (NIEPA) in 2005, 8.1% of primary schools in India have no classrooms, while 17.5% have only one teacher.
In addition, 76.2% of schools do not have clean drinking water, while 14.6% lack electricity.
Less than 4% of all primary schools have computers.
Likewise, the Mumbai-based NGO Pratham’s Annual Status of Education Report 2005 , which was prepared after a survey in 28 states and union territories, reveals that 35% of children in the 7-14 age group are unable to read simple paragraphs, while 41% failed to solve a simple two-digit subtraction problem or a division problem.
Instead of preparing a pool of educated workers for the future, the government’s policies have given rise to an illiterate and innumerate population.
These findings raise damning suspicions about the literacy levels that successive Indian governments have claimed to achieve.
If the state of primary education is this bad, will the disadvantaged classes ever stand a chance?
Moreover, according to Vinod Raina, a member of the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE), 80 million of India’s 200 million children between 6-14 years of age are not in school at all.
Of the remaining 120 million, only 20 million are expected to reach the tenth year of school, with the rest dropping out along the way.
Indeed, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently expressed dismay over the fact that “only 47 out of 100 children enrolled in class I reach class VIII.”
The government has pledged in its National Common Minimum Program to raise public expenditure on education to 6% of GDP.
However, recent years have witnessed a steady decline in educational spending, from 4% of GDP in 2001-02 to 3.8% in 2002-04 and 3.5% in 2004-05.
Quality education is the single greatest asset that a nation can give to its people.
It also happens to be the least expensive and most cost-effective support that government can provide.
But Indian politicians’ interests appear to lie elsewhere.
After all, with the rate of functional literacy at only 37.5%, they can easily manipulate the votes of uneducated people with alcohol, pop slogans, and intimidation.
So the protests by highly educated Indians against “reserved places” is not only wrongheaded, but dangerous as well.
Unless India’s highly educated stand up for better schools for all, protests against caste preferences will only succeed in heightening tensions and selling newspapers, rather than improving the lives of India’s destitute.
The government is probably happy with these protests, for they divert attention from the real issue – the authorities’ utter failure to address the fundamental problem.
As in America, the issue is not racial and class reservations and preferences, but ensuring high-quality primary education for all, rich and poor alike.
As India’s educated revolt against preferences, they should not do so in a way that reinforces illiteracy.
India’s Israel Envy
NEW DELHI – As Israeli planes and tanks exact a heavy toll on Gaza, India’s leaders and strategic thinkers have been watching with an unusual degree of interest – and some empathy.
India’s government has, no surprise, joined the rest of the world in calling for an end to the military action, but its criticism of Israel has been muted.
For, as Israel demonstrates anew its determination to end attacks on its civilians by militants based in Hamas-controlled territory, many in India, still smarting from the horrors of the Mumbai attacks in November, have been asking: why can’t we do the same?
For many Indians, the temptation to identify with Israel was strengthened by the terrorists’ seizure of Mumbai’s Jewish Center (the Lubavitcher Chabad house) and the painful awareness that India and Israel share many of the same enemies.
India, with its 150-million strong Muslim population, has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and remains staunchly committed to an independent Palestinian state.
But the Mumbai attacks confirmed what has become apparent in recent years: the forces of global Islamist terror have added Indians to their target list of reviled “Jews and crusaders.”
Just as Israel has frequently been attacked by rockets fired from across its border with Gaza, India has suffered repeated assaults by killers trained, equipped, financed, and directed by elements based next door in Pakistan.
When President George W. Bush’s press secretary equated members of Hamas with the Mumbai killers, her comments were widely circulated in India.
Yet there the parallels end.
Israel is a small country living in a permanent state of siege, highly security-conscious and surrounded by forces hostile to it; India is a giant country whose borders are notoriously permeable, an open society known for its lax and easy-going ways.
Whereas many regard Israel’s toughness as its principal characteristic, India’s own citizens view it as a soft state, its underbelly easily penetrated by determined terrorists.
Whereas Israel notoriously exacts grim retribution for every attack on its soil, India has endured with numbing stoicism an endless series of bomb blasts, including at least six major assaults in different locations in 2008 alone.
Terrorism has taken more lives in India than in any country in the world after Iraq, and yet, unlike Israel, India has seemed unable to do anything about it.
Moreover, whereas Israel’s principal adversary is currently Hamas, India faces a slew of terrorist organizations – Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, and more.
But, whereas Hamas operates without international recognition from Gaza – its legitimacy questioned even by the Palestinian Authority – India’s tormentors function from Pakistan, a sovereign member of the United Nations.
And that makes all the difference.
Hamas is in no position to repay Israel’s air and ground attacks in kind, whereas an Indian attack on Pakistani territory, even one targeting terrorist bases and training camps, would invite swift retaliation from the Pakistani army.
Israel can dictate the terms of its military incursion and end it at will, whereas an Indian military action would immediately spark a war with a well-armed neighbor that neither side could win.
And, at the end of the day, one chilling fact would prevent India from thinking that it could use Israel’s playbook: the country that condones, if not foments, the terror attacks on India is a nuclear power.
So India has gone to the international community with evidence to prove that the Mumbai attacks were planned in Pakistan and conducted by Pakistani citizens who maintained contact with handlers in Pakistan throughout the operation.
While India’s government had briefly hoped that the proof might enable Pakistan’s weak civilian government to rein in the malign elements in its society, the Pakistani authorities’ reaction has been one of denial.
Yet no one doubts that Pakistan’s all-powerful military intelligence has, over the last two decades, created and supported terror organizations as instruments of Pakistani policy in Afghanistan and India.
When India’s embassy in Kabul was hit by a suicide bomber last July, American intelligence sources revealed that not only was Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence behind the attack, but that it made little effort to cover its tracks.
The ISI knew perfectly well that India would not go to war with Pakistan to avenge the killing of its diplomatic personnel.
The fact is that India knows that war will accomplish nothing.
Indeed, it is just what the terrorists want – a cause that would rally all Pakistanis to the flag and provide Pakistan’s army an excuse to abandon the unpopular fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the west for the more familiar terrain of the Indian border in the east.
India’s government sees no reason to play into the hands of those who seek that outcome.
Yet, when Indians watch Israel take the fight to the enemy, killing those who launched rockets against it and dismantling many of the sites from which the rockets flew, some cannot resist wishing that they could do something similar in Pakistan.
India understands, though, that the collateral damage would be too high, the price in civilian lives unacceptable, and the risks of the conflict spiraling out of control too acute to contemplate such an option.
So Indians place their trust in international diplomacy and watch, with ill-disguised wistfulness, as Israel does what they could never permit themselves to do.
India’s New Path to Greatness
SINGAPORE – It is unwise to underestimate the near-metaphysical significance of the recent Indian elections.
The Indian electorate decisively pushed world history in the right direction with the re-election of the Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi partnership.
They now have the mandate and power to press for greater economic reform and liberalization.
The incipient tiger in the Indian economy will be released.
The simultaneous rise of China and India will strengthen the forces of modernization and moderation globally.
At a time of global crisis, the world should celebrate this new burst of energy.
Virtually no one predicted this spectacular outcome.
Most observers underestimated the Indian electorate, which understood the many benefits of the Singh-Gandhi partnership.
First, their Congress government revived the moderate secular traditions of Jawaharlal Nehru and brought India back firmly to the political center, wresting control from communal and ideological extremists.
Second, the electorate grasped the importance of re-electing a modest but wise and determined leader who understood the direction India needed to take.
Singh will open up India’s economy even more than he has so far.
As he once said, “Although India has a large domestic market, our experience with earlier relatively insular policies, as also the global experience in this regard, clearly bring out the growth potential of trade and economic cooperation with the global economy.”
Finally, Singh will continue to re-engage India’s Asian neighbors and push for greater regional cooperation.
As far back as 1995 he said, “It is this vision, of a resurgent India taking her rightful place as an economic powerhouse in Asia, which has inspired our economic policies.”
Just as China has signed a free-trade agreement with ASEAN, India will seek to do so.
A process of competitive economic liberalization will sweep across Asia, further guaranteeing the region’s continued resurgence.
All this will be propelled by India’s new cultural confidence.
In the 1950’s and 1960’s, few leading Indians believed that their country could compete with the industrialized economies.
Hence, the Mumbai industrialists’ club used to be inherently protectionist.
Today, the same industrialists, convinced that India can compete with the best, support Singh’s reforms.
Yet India continues to face many challenges: nearly 300 million people living in poverty, the spreading Naxalite insurgency, the danger of terrorist attacks ala Mumbai, and sprawling urban slums.
In addition, how will Singh balance the trade-off between pro-market and pro-poor policies?
How will he manage the growing middle class’s expectations of better infrastructure, expanded access to health care and education, uninterrupted electricity and water supplies, and more efficient transport facilities?
These problems will not be solved overnight.
But the growing conviction that tomorrow will be better will keep India’s polity stable.
This may well be the most important result of the Indian election: five more years of political stability and economic reform will create an irreversible and virtuous cycle of economic growth and political moderation.
The Indian middle class will grow rapidly, providing the country with valuable ballast that will keep it on an even keel in the next few decades.
One statistic is worth noting. At the current stage of development of many Asian economies, a 10% increase in the median income can lead to a doubling of the middle class.
And such an increase is eminently achievable.
It was purely coincidental that the extremist Tamil Tigers leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, was killed and his movement decimated at the same time as India was voting. But the significance should not be missed.
Prabhakaran, not Al Qaeda, invented suicide bombing. His elimination shows the futility of the river of terror that he unleashed on history.
But if Sri Lanka’s President Mahinda Rajapaksa wants to eliminate the spirit of Tamil separatism, he must emulate Singh’s culture of political moderation.
Rajapaksa was wise to speak a few words in Tamil while announcing the victory over the Tigers.
He must now follow up by creating an open, inclusive environment, like India’s, that will enable both Sinhalese and Tamils to thrive.
Pakistan remains India’s single biggest challenge.
There can be no doubt that Singh has the right instincts.
He wants Pakistan to succeed as a moderate, modernizing country.
He wants no more wars.
But these instincts can be bolstered by wise long-term policies.
India could take a leaf from China’s success in handling the Taiwan problem.
At the height of tensions, when China found the governments of Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian intolerable, it never ceased its policy of embracing the Taiwanese people and Taiwanese businessmen.
Over time, this created a rich web of economic interdependence, which promotes stability.
It would be equally easy for India’s people to embrace Pakistan’s people.
They are the same people.
As an ethnic Sindhi, I feel an affinity to both.
When I attend international gatherings, I am amazed how easily and naturally Indians and Pakistanis gravitate toward each other.
The political divisions are artificial.
The cultural unity is natural.
The Pakistani population can easily work with the political moderation of Singh’s government.
Indeed, the open spirit of both President Barack Obama and Singh toward the Islamic world has probably provided the best political opportunity to find a lasting political solution for the India-Pakistan problem.
In short, the re-election of the Singh government has made the world a less dangerous place and has opened up many political opportunities.
It is hard to imagine India with a better prime minister.
Singh is one of the best economists in the world.
At the same time, he demonstrated that he has a spine of steel when he refused to buckle under to severe pressures to renounce the India-United States nuclear deal.
Singh stood his ground and achieved victory.
The benefits of his resolve will now be enjoyed by India and the world.
India’s New Ruling Caste
CAMBRIDGE – The largest election in history, involving more than 700 million voters, has resulted in the victory of India’s ruling alliance, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Indian National Congress.
The verdict disproved gloomy predictions of a hung parliament and the further strengthening of regional parties.
The new government will be far more stable than many of its predecessors, so the election results have elicited profound relief.
But the fact remains that, like previous governments, the new administration will consist mostly of politicians unfit to hold ministerial office.
While several provincial satraps have been cut down to size, new, aspiring ones have garnered significant support.
Despite the manifest success of Indian democracy, its parliamentary system is not succeeding in giving India good governance.
Obviously, India is not a failed state.
Lant Pritchett of the Harvard Kennedy School has coined a new name for India: a “flailing state” – a state where the government’s extremely competent upper echelons are unable to control its inefficient lower levels, resulting in poor performance.
But this analysis gives credit where none is due: India’s problem is its top political leadership’s lack of competence.
The inability of India’s current political system to provide effective government places the country in a different category: a non-performing state.
The idealism of India’s freedom movement quickly evaporated after independence in the face of the opportunities for patronage that came with power.
The way India’s political system evolved has made politics the surest path to wealth.
The money spent to win elections (often including the purchase of a party’s nomination) is recouped many times over once the winner is in office.
Half of India’s legislators who stood for reelection this time around had tripled their assets in the last five years.
Increasing corruption within governments run by the Congress party, which led India to independence and monopolized political power for decades, showed what a lucrative career politics had become.
Given India’s religious, caste, and linguistic divides, politicians saw how easily they could leverage even a small following into votes.
Soon, Indian political parties began to break up, giving rise to a large number of regional and caste-based parties.
Most of these parties are led by political dynasties that prize loyalty over merit.
Because of the splintering of political parties, India has had only one single-party government and eight coalition governments in the last two decades.
Members of the coalition governments have treated the ministries allocated to them as fiefdoms, to be milked for their benefit.
Over time, India’s government has become primarily a tool for advancing the personal interests of politicians rather than the entity responsible for running the country.
The opportunity for personal gains through public office has made electoral politics an automatic career choice for Indian politicians’ progeny.
Record numbers of sons and daughters of political leaders and millionaires (and people with criminal backgrounds) contested this election.
We are seeing the formation of a new Indian caste – a caste of rulers different from India’s traditional Kshatriya caste – before our very eyes.
Like existing castes, the new caste specializes in one occupation: political office.
Just as someone became a carpenter or a trader in an earlier era merely through birth, members of India’s ruling caste now become leaders of parties, members of legislatures, and cabinet ministers solely because of their parentage.
And, as with the older castes, there is no need for any qualification for the vocation; birth alone is sufficient.
Lack of vocational competence never barred Indians from remaining in their caste, and how well one performs in political office is, likewise, not a criterion for politicians to continue in positions of power.
India’s parliamentary system requires ministers to be members of the legislature.
Party leaders select family members and other loyal followers as candidates for elections, with absolutely no consideration of their abilities to fulfill ministerial responsibilities, resulting in cabinets that are simply not capable of managing the problems confronting the country’s national and state governments.
Even with the best political leadership, governing India is no easy task.
Successive governments staffed with unqualified politicians have failed dismally to carry out the core governmental functions of maintaining law and order, providing the basic services expected of modern societies, and promoting economic growth.
India’s high-performing private sector has so far masked the failure of the Indian state.
In its current form, India’s parliamentary system can produce only non-performing, corrupt governments.
It rewards ambition, promotes office-at-any-cost politics, and devalues merit.
Taking away the prize of ministerial office from elected representatives might discourage wealth-maximizing politicians from entering politics.
It is time, therefore, for India to consider introducing a presidential system of government, which would reduce the scope for “horse trading” and allow the country’s leader to select competent people for cabinet positions.
India’s Nuclear Conundrum
NEW DELHI – Japan’s nuclear disaster has fueled fear and uncertainty among all of the world’s producers of nuclear power.
For India, an energy-starved country, much is at stake.
That fear factor has two main causes.
Although nuclear power ranks as a “clean” source of energy, it is accompanied by the terrible shadow of nuclear war, which emerged from Japan’s last reckoning with nuclear catastrophe, 65 years ago at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and which lends it an automatic association with mass destruction and death.
Moreover, the secrecy that attends all things “nuclear” has left people not knowing enough to feel confident.
The fear inspired by the Fukushima Daiichi disaster will be reflected in soaring costs for nuclear power worldwide, largely owing to demands for improved safety and the need to pay more to insure the potential risks.
Indeed, nuclear plants are prone to a form of “panic transference.”
Should a reactor of one design go wrong, all reactors of that type will be shut down instantly around the world.
India’s dilemma is this: it has 20 nuclear plants in operation, with an additional 23 on order.
With the country desperately short of power, and requiring energy to grow, concerned citizens are asking if nuclear is still the answer for India.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has cautiously announced that a “special safety review” of all plants will be undertaken.
“Not enough,” say roughly 50 eminent Indians, who at the end of March demanded a “radical review” of the country’s entire nuclear-power policy for “appropriateness, safety, costs, and public acceptance.”
The group also called for an “independent, transparent safety audit” of all nuclear facilities, to be undertaken with the “involvement of civil-society organizations and experts outside the Department of Atomic Energy.”
Until then, there should be “a moratorium on all…nuclear activity” and “revocation of recent clearances.”
This is as explicit as opposition can get.
How have other countries reacted?
France, which is around 80% dependent on nuclear energy, and is a big exporter of nuclear-plant technology, initially avoided most of the global anti-nuclear concerns.
But now it, too, is promising to draw the necessary lessons from the Japanese experience and upgrade its safety procedures, including a reassessment of the potential effects of natural disasters on nuclear-plant operations, conceding that the occurrence of more than one natural disaster simultaneously had not been considered previously.
China, which has 77 nuclear reactors at various stages of construction, planning, and discussion, has said that it will “review its program.”
Though Russia has formally announced that it will go ahead with its program, former President Mikhail Gorbachev – on whose watch the Chernobyl meltdown occurred 25 years ago – is not so sanguine.
While the US is the principal exporter of reactors, it currently has just two under construction on its own territory.
Denmark, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are strongly anti-nuclear, and Switzerland has stopped all nuclear-power projects. 
All of this will lead to cost evaluation and escalation.
According to a study conducted by the former Indian government minister Arun Shourie, the price of uranium could rise to $140 per pound, close to its record high.
A change of much greater consequence concerns the price of reactors.
Pre-Fukushima, a report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), “The Future of Nuclear Power, 2003,” as well as a study by researchers at the University of Chicago, established that nuclear energy was 50-100% more expensive than energy from coal or gas.
The report of the Working Group on Power of the Planning Commission of India puts the cost of energy from the country’s coal-based plants at about one-third lower than nuclear power, with gas 50% cheaper.
Energy security and public safety should be of equal importance in determining future policy on nuclear power.
Indeed, experts like C. M. A. Nayar have said that the Fukushima accident “could have happened even if there was no tsunami.”
Nayar suggests that it has long been known that the reactor’s design contained basic flaws, though only the Japanese authorities can verify this.
So, what is to be done?
Clean energy at a time of global warming is obviously necessary.  But so is the safety and security of humans, animals, and plants.
India has set itself on a path of virtually doubling its nuclear-power output.
This is deeply troubling, for India’s supply of nuclear fuel, technology, and reactors is almost entirely dependent on imports from manufacturers who refuse liability for any malfunction.
There is, of course, no single correct response that would simultaneously and uniformly deal with resource scarcity, fossil-fuel depletion, climate change, and the risks of nuclear power.
A choice will ultimately need to be made about how to meet India’s energy demands.
At a minimum, a thorough reexamination and full public debate must precede the construction of any new nuclear plant.
But the current emphasis on nuclear power must be objectively reassessed, and dependence on it thereafter reduced.
With nuclear safety suddenly becoming a global imperative, the costs are simply too high to do otherwise.
India’s Olympic Also-Rans
NEW DELHI – As the world awaits the Beijing Olympics, many wonder whether China’s grand coming-out party will also mark the occasion when it wrests dominance of the medal tally from the United States.
China’s dedicated athletes are widely assumed to have dozens of gold and silver medals in their grasp.
Whether or not they overtake the US, however, one thing is certain: China’s neighbor and regional geopolitical rival, India, will be lucky to win even a single medal.
International sport is, of course, an exercise in national chauvinism by other means.
At some level, we all pretend to tune into the Olympics to admire human athleticism.
But none of us can deny the attraction of the flags under which those athletes compete, the anthem that is played for the winners, and, ultimately, that impossible-to-ignore, regularly-updated medal tally, listing the gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded to each country, the Games’ real honor roll.
Every Indian who follows the Olympics has cringed scanning the daily list of medal winners, eyes traveling down past dozens of nations big and small before alighting on a solitary Indian bronze in tennis or wrestling.
Worse yet, we have all known the shame of waiting day after day for India to appear on the list at all, as countries a hundredth our size record gold upon gold and Indian athletes are barely mentioned among the also-rans.
Indians like to think we can hold our own against the best in the world in any field: our Kalidasa can stand up to their Shakespeare, our Ramanujan to their Einstein, our Bollywood to their Hollywood and, these days, our Infosys to their Microsoft.
In sport, however, it is a different story.
Our cricketers have come close to being considered the best in the world, but cricket is not an Olympic sport.
Our sole world champion in any sport is the chess grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand – in another non-Olympic sport, and one that calls for brain, not brawn.
In fact, in the Olympics, India’s record has declined over time.
The one gold medal we had become used to winning since the 1920’s, in field hockey, has proved elusive in recent Games, as our players have stumbled on Astroturf.
This year, India’s hockey players failed even to qualify for the Games.
In everything where simple human prowess is at stake – running, jumping, swimming, lifting, throwing - Indians simply don’t have what it takes.
An Indian beauty queen, Madhu Sapre, once became an unwitting victim of Indians’ sense of national shame at our sporting insignificance.
She was unjustly denied a Miss World title in 1992 because of her answer to the final-round question, “What is the first thing you would do if you became the ruler of your country?” Her response – “I would build a sports stadium” – was considered stupid by the judges, and the almost-certain crown (she was the overwhelming favorite) slipped from her grasp.
Sapre’s answer might not have been the brightest, but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success, they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority.
Why do Indian athletes perform so badly?
The explanations range from the anthropological to the borderline racist: Indians don’t have the genes, the build, the stamina, the climate, whatever.
There are structural and infrastructural explanations: lack of training facilities, gymnasiums, running tracks, equipment, financial resources.
We are a developing country, it is said; after all, it is not just your eye against his, your legs against hers, but what you can do against their trainer, their running shoe, their ergodynamic costume, their titanium archer’s bow.
But those rationales won’t do: other developing countries, from Jamaica to Ethiopia, regularly rake in the medals.
Our talent pool isn’t really a billion, some argue; it’s only the well off and middle class, maybe 300 million strong, who can afford to play sports.
But even that is a larger population base than a hundred countries that do better than India at the Olympics.
On the other hand, the incentives for success are not great; the years of sacrifice and effort it takes to become a world-class athlete are simply not a realistic option to an Indian who needs to make a living, and sponsors are few and far between (and they are all spending their sponsorship money on cricket).
Finally, there’s the usual Indian problem: sports administrative bodies and government departments are ridden with patronage and petty bossism, with officials more interested in protecting their turf (and enjoying paid vacations to sporting events) than in promoting athletes.
With all these factors, failure in the Olympics, it is suggested, is encoded in our national DNA.
Yet success or failure still depends on the individual athlete.
Indian genes in a developing country did not prevent Vijay Singh emerging from Fiji to rival Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world.
And if Indians can be better than white and black sportsmen on the cricket field, why can’t they beat them in an Olympic stadium?
The newly globalized India can no longer content itself with mediocrity in this global competition.
For a land with world-class computer scientists, mathematicians, biotech researchers, filmmakers, and novelists, sporting excellence is the last unconquered frontier.
But 2008 won’t be the year in which that frontier is breached.
India’s Second Wind
NEW DELHI – The Indian economy is coming back.
After several years of disappointing performance, the authorities are shifting to policies aimed at boosting the annual growth rate closer to the roughly 9% level that India achieved from 2004 to 2008.
That won’t be easy.
India has many handicaps and lacks many of the things that are needed to sustain rapid growth.
Although India has outstanding universities and technological institutes, the primary-education system is disastrously poor.
The caste system and labor laws prevent an efficient labor market.
The policy of quotas for lower castes and for members of certain “scheduled” tribes affects educational institutions, government employment, and even private firms.
Populist policies that transfer scarce budget funds to hundreds of millions of rural men and women end up encouraging them to withdraw their labor services, driving up wages and undermining international competitiveness.
True, bureaucratic rules are not nearly as constraining as they were during the pre-1991 “license raj.”
But business activity remains bogged down by myriad restrictions and a frustratingly slow judicial system, which, together with a complex system of price subsidies, encourage widespread corruption at every level of government.
Moreover, India’s infrastructure is inadequate for a modern economy.
With too little electricity, blackouts are common.
Ports are inefficient, roads are congested, and traffic is astonishingly chaotic.
And, while India urgently needs to reform its tax system, spending policies, and regulation, political change is difficult in a multiparty federalist democracy of 1.2 billion people spread over a large subcontinent.
The current government is a fragile multiparty coalition.
The Congress party leads the government, but lacks a majority in both chambers of Parliament.
Coalition infighting and the prospect of a national election in 2014 further complicate efforts to enact reform legislation.
And yet, despite everything, India’s economy did record roughly 9% growth for several years, and even now is growing by nearly 6% annually, behind only China and Indonesia among major economies.
One key to India’s economic success is a large population of technically educated entrepreneurs, who are creating new companies and building a modern middle class.
A high rate of private saving and strong inflows of capital from abroad have supported investment in plant and equipment.
The Indian states have substantial policy discretion and often compete to attract businesses and achieve rapid economic growth.
The main ingredient needed to achieve faster sustained growth is increased investment.
Reducing the budget deficit – by limiting government spending and combating a culture of tax avoidance – will increase total domestic savings available to invest.
Convincing foreign direct investors that India is a reliable destination will increase the inflow of long-term funds.
Fortunately, the recent threat of a downgrade of Inda’s sovereign credit rating – which would have made it difficult to finance the current-account deficit – has led to a government reshuffle and a shift in policies.
The key political change was the appointment of a new finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, whose selection by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi sent a strong positive signal to the Indian business community and to financial markets.
Chidambaram, a Harvard-trained lawyer who has held the finance portfolio twice before, is committed to increasing growth and to adopting pro-market policies.
He knows what needs to be done – and is pushing his political colleagues to do it.
One sign of progress is that a new cabinet committee, chaired by Singh, will review large private investment projects that have been held up by regulatory issues or other legal barriers.
Breaking this logjam will be important, both in itself and for the message that it conveys to domestic and foreign investors.
Likewise, India’s recent decision to allow large foreign retailers like Wal-Mart to enter the market reflects an encouraging change of attitude that is important beyond the specifics of the particular firms that will now come to India.
And legislation will soon create the opportunity for expanded foreign ownership in the financial sector.
On the fiscal front, the shift from a complex system of state-level indirect taxes to a national goods and services tax (a type of value-added tax) will improve efficiency and raise revenue.
Lowering the subsidy for diesel fuel was politically difficult, but will reduce both the fiscal deficit and excessive use of diesel products.
Government investment in infrastructure, both alone and in partnership with private firms, will also directly benefit growth and attract larger inflows of foreign investment.
Finally, a remarkable plan to enroll every Indian adult in a program using fingerprint identification as a substitute for bank debit cards will allow more efficient distribution of funds to poor villagers and the urban poor.
More than three hundred million Indians have already been enrolled.
All of this is an enormous undertaking – one that confronts innumerable potential impediments, both economic and political.
But I am betting that India is rising again: millions more will be lifted out of poverty in the coming years, while the increasingly prosperous Indian middle class will expand further.
India’s Wounded State
NEW DELHI – The September 7 bomb blast at the entrance to the High Court in New Delhi was a macabre finale to a summer of crisis.
Previously, weeks of anti-corruption protests launched by Anna Harare, and supported by the country’s rising middle class, had brought India’s government to a virtual standstill.
This was followed by an embarrassing surrender to the demand of protestors that a powerful new anti-corruption agency be established.
For some people, the protests that paralyzed large swathes of the capital were akin to a festival.
Others, following the government’s retreat, grandiosely thought the events amounted to a revolution.
To be sure, a large part of urban “middle India” has revolted against the tyranny of daily corruption.
But will the Harare-led protests deliver real change or merely media hyperbole?
Whichever side one takes, the consequences are disturbing: Indian society, the core of Indian nationhood, is now questioning the very legitimacy of the Indian state. 
India’s nationhood resides in a non-territorial civilizational entity.
The Indian state, on the other hand, is a historical variable that has periodically governed parts of the subcontinent.
Following independence in 1947, a centralized Indian state emerged for the first time.
For citizens, the Indian state is the great provider – mai-baap, literally “mother and father.”
The strength of Indian nationhood, however, lies not in this state but in Indian society.
This idea was at the core of Gandhi’s beliefs; he emphasized “reform of society,” because only that, he believed, could correct the state’s ills.
Herein lies the central disconnect, and also the source of discontent, for today’s India: if and when an Indian citizen now approaches this state, for even the most routine of needs, the state inflicts pain rather than providing succor.
The Indian state’s fundamental inability to redress grievances, correct mistakes, and attend to its citizens’ most basic needs has given rise to a ruinous level of corruption, as citizens, despairing of obtaining their due fairly, try to buy it instead.
The state then turns into a monopoly seller, and thus an enemy of its own society.
For Anna Harare and his followers, the only solution is another state agency – a vast and all-powerful anti-corruption watchdog with the power to coerce and intimidate.
Others call for a spiritual revival within Indian society.
It is no surprise, of course, that large crowds cheered for Harare and his anti-corruption movement, by which they assumed a vicarious role in slaying the demon of corruption.
Their abuse was reserved for “evil parliamentarians” – or any politicians – as vile agents of a crooked state.
Unfortunately, India’s government misunderstood the anti-corruption protests from the start.
At first, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stood firm against Harare’s demands on technical grounds.
But this proved insufficient to halt a growing sense of drift and decay concerning his Congress Party-led coalition.
This sense of malaise was highlighted on India’s Independence Day (August 15).
Confronted by multiple charges of corruption against his government, the prime minister’s address to the nation partly sought to divert attention from the scandals by focusing, bizarrely, on a litany of other problems, from high inflation and the Naxalite rebellion to persistent malnutrition and terrorist attacks.
Yet the overriding theme remained corruption.
And what else could it be?
After all, the current government is possibly the most corrupt, in every sense, that India has ever experienced.
Were periodic elections the only yardstick of democracy, India would have achieved what US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calls the “gold standard.”
But that is far removed from reality and the nature of its ruling party.
The Congress Party, to paraphrase Brown University’s Richard Snyder, resembles a “neo-patrilineal dictatorship,” in which “[p]eople get goodies for being close to the ruler.”
Proximity to the Gandhi family is everything.
Congress, at its core, pursues a form of dynastic democracy with the characteristics of a “Sultanistic regime” – a regime with no purpose or function apart from maintaining the “leader’s personal authority.”
But, though such leaders perhaps have more personal authority than even medieval monarchs, their authority is brittle.
Moreover, societies lose their cohesion under such regimes; they begin to lack a shared set of values, for they become relegated to living in “a belief vacuum.”
There is another depressing aspect to the corruption debate.
Both Singh and the US State Department helped spread the canard that foreign influence was at work behind the scenes.
“External forces,” Singh declared in Parliament, are trying to prevent India from taking “its true place” in the comity of nations.
“We must not play into their hands,” he intoned gravely.
Meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson urged India’s authorities to act with “appropriate democratic restraint” in response to the crisis provoked by Harare’s protests.
This was an egregious bit of meddling.
After all, non-violent protests are an Indian specialty
But Gandhi’s yardstick for non-violent protest was satyagraha – “the protest of truth.”
By contrast, India’s current anti-corruption protests may be missing the point, for the central challenge in fighting corruption is to establish a freedom born of righteous conduct, not to authorize a new source of state coercion.
Indian society must regain its strength – and its proper role.
Only when India, as the great poet Rabindranath Tagore put it, is a place “where the head is held high and the mind is without fear” will it be able to act with the confidence, honesty, and generosity its citizens demand and deserve.
India’s Year of Living Stagnantly
NEW DELHI – Will 2012 prove to be a year of renewal for India, or another annus horribilis?
No country progresses unerringly, but India cannot afford another politically and economically torpid year like 2011.
For India, last year is a year best forgotten.
India has been so deeply mired in political paralysis that the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen recently said that the country has “fallen from being the second best to the second worst” South Asian country, and that it is currently “no match for China” on social indicators.
This is a damning comment on a country that held such promise just a short time ago.
In early January, the American social critic James Howard Kunstler described India as “a nation with one foot in the modern age and the other in a colorful hallucinatory dreamtime.”
Kunstler’s view is harsh, but perhaps prophetic: India’s “climate-change-related problems are doing heavy damage to the food supply.
Their groundwater is almost gone.
The troubles of the wobbling global economy will take a lot of pep out of their burgeoning tech and manufacturing sectors.”
Indeed, suddenly, India’s economy has begun spinning out of control.
Last year, the country’s GDP growth slowed, manufacturing plummeted, and inflation and corruption grew uncontrollably.
Elected and unelected government officials alike, including cabinet ministers, members of parliament, and civil servants, were implicated in corruption scandals.
The situation triggered recollections of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s fraudulent call for a state of emergency in 1975, when she ruled by decree for 21 months, suspending elections and civil liberties.
The population’s outraged response to these events was visceral, and previously unknown figures such as the anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare rallied thousands of Indians in meetings across the country to protest against government corruption.
As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government floundered, the opposition vainly sought to gain the upper hand.
But, to ordinary Indians, this political gamesmanship appeared to be merely a farce – the blind pretending to lead the unsighted.
Perhaps for the first time ever, India’s government failed to enact even a single piece of legislation, much less undertake any economic reforms, restore price stability, or address widespread civil disorder.
As the Indian business analyst Virendra Parekh has observed:&nbsp; “The second fastest-growing economy in the world now has the unenviable distinction of having the fastest falling financial markets in Asia.”
Moreover, “the fortunes of the rupee are….tightly linked with the euro, which is in the throes of an existential crisis...” This has resulted in another, albeit unintended, consequence: “Unscrupulous politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who have stashed their illicit wealth abroad, are bringing some of it back,” passing off the money as export earnings.
Where corruption has been absent, incompetence has replaced it.
Furthermore, weaknesses in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and governance have all contributed to India’s current crisis.
For example, approximately a quarter-million Indian farmers have allegedly committed suicide over the last 16 years, despite unprecedented economic growth.
This statistic begs the question of why India continues to import foods and oils that could be produced domestically.
Solutions offered by organizations such as the US-India Business Council or USAID do not address the problem’s roots, and the crisis will most likely continue in 2012.
It is imperative that India invest in its agriculture, not only for economic reasons, but also because it is central to the country’s culture.
Another concern is nuclear power.
In 2008, the United States and India agreed to a civil nuclear deal that would allow India to expand its nuclear-power capability.
In 2010, India’s parliament passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, a precondition for activating that agreement.
But, following Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, safety concerns surrounding nuclear power are large and mounting.
Local farmers, fishermen, and environmentalists have spent months protesting a planned six-reactor nuclear-power complex on the plains of Jaitapur, south of Mumbai.
In April, the protests turned violent, leaving one man dead and dozens injured.
India will certainly see more anti-nuclear clashes in 2012.
At the heart of India’s current malaise is a paradox: rapid growth in real income has not been matched by genuine advances in living standards.
If the country’s fundamental problems are to be addressed, India needs a government with the determination, integrity, and intelligence to meet the complex demands of modern governance in the twenty-first century.
India Takes the Lead
A decisive blow against poverty was struck when India's new Finance Minister Chidambaram tabled the 2004/2005 budget.
India is a country on the move, with rapid economic development and dazzling dynamism in the information technology sector. Yet it is also home to 300 million of the world's poorest people.
In last May's national elections, India's rural voters unseated the ruling coalition.
The lesson was clear: attend to rural poverty.
The new government has listened, putting forward a program that is dazzling in its implications, for India and the developing world.
India's new government is led by a veritable "dream team" of international development.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is one of the world's leading development economists.
It was Singh, serving in mid-1991 as India's Finance Minister, who began India's market reforms.
He dismantled decades of inefficient and ineffective government restraints on trade, investment, and entrepreneurship, unleashing more than a decade of the fastest economic growth in India's history.
Upon returning to office this spring as Prime Minister, Singh brought into government an experienced and internationally renowned team, including Finance Minister Chidambaram, who served successfully as Finance Minister in the mid-1990's, and Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who heads the Planning Commission, the key body assessing India's medium-term public investment strategies.
When the former government lost the vote this past May, and Singh's government came into office, there were fears that Singh would be hamstrung by left-wing coalition partners, who would demand that market reforms be dismantled as the price of their participation in the new ruling coalition.
Chidambaram's 2004/2005 budget puts those fears to rest.
The document is a brilliant lesson in development economics: it shows how to combine a full-speed ahead approach to market reforms with urgently needed attention to poverty.
In short, the budget is a model for all developing countries.
At the heart of the budget is the realization that reducing poverty requires both rapid economic growth and targeted investments aimed at the poorest of the poor.
Rapid economic growth is to be based on the private sector, including foreign direct investment.
Thus, the budget supports critical areas of market reform and growth promotion, including measures aimed at deepening the financial sector, promoting exports, and liberalizing foreign direct investment.
The key, however, is that the budget does not rely simply on "trickle-down" economics to raise living standards.
The second pillar of poverty reduction is targeted investments for the poor, particularly for the rural poor.
This approach commits India's national government and state governments to ensuring that all Indians, including the poorest, have access to basic social investments, including health, nutrition, and schooling, and to basic infrastructure, including electricity, information and communications technology, safe drinking water, and inputs for modern agriculture. Every village is to be lifted up in the next few years, empowered with the basic tools to become economically productive.
The scale of the challenge is immense.
There are an estimated 600,000 villages in this vast country of one billion citizens.
Villages that are far from major ports and cities tend to be poorer and less invigorated by the recent economic growth.
The government proposes to equip these villages with the basic infrastructure and services they need to take off economically.
The government's programs are not mere populist promises. They reflect sensible investments that the government intends to pursue.
The budget calls for a surtax on incomes to help pay for increased social expenditures.
The lesson for other developing countries is that spending on the poor for health, education, safe drinking water, electricity, and the like, is not simply pandering; it is a serious and productive investment.
It may be expensive to educate a child, but it is far more expensive to a society to leave a child without education.
Uneducated children will be burdens on their societies for decades to come.
It is far more rational to spend a little extra income now for a few years of schooling than face decades of social costs resulting from masses of uneducated adult workers!
But even India, with its growing economy, cannot afford to make these investments out of national resources.
India will need some help, at least temporarily, from richer countries and international institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
The rich world should not be grudging in its help to India.
By providing a few billion dollars per year in assistance now, the donor world would ensure a prosperous, democratic, and stable partner in India for decades to come.
In other words, it is time for donors to step up to help reform-minded yet poor countries like India, and, even more urgently, those in Africa that are similarly committed to economic development.
Demonetization Dos and Don’ts
CAMBRIDGE – On November 8, at 8:15 in the evening, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced that, at the stroke of midnight, all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes in circulation would no longer be considered legal tender, and would need to be exchanged for new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes.
Modi’s “demonetization” intervention affected 85% of the money in circulation in India.
It was an unprecedented move, whether in India or almost anywhere else, and it is by far Modi’s boldest policy intervention to date.
The Modi government is targeting the “black money” associated with tax evasion, corruption, and counterfeiting, and thus the drug traffickers, smugglers, and terrorists who engage in those activities.
India’s tax-paying salaried classes and even the poor initially welcomed the policy enthusiastically, viewing it as sweet revenge against tax evaders who had stowed away their ill-gotten gains; they reveled in anecdotes of corrupt officials burning bags of cash or throwing money into India’s rivers.
But with each passing day, that initial cheer diminishes.
Public frustration is now mounting, because the government has failed to meet the demand for new printed notes.
Commerce in India – where the cash-to-GDP ratio is 10% – relies heavily on cash transactions, and informal-economy and small-business operations have now ground to a halt, owing to long lines and tight cash-withdrawal limits at banks and shortages at ATMs.
The near-term impact will be the equivalent of an “anti-stimulus” policy intervention, and the consequent drag on demand will be significant.
Moreover, as real-estate prices decline, so, too, will household wealth.
Although lower house prices will make new homes more affordable, the stock of occupied homes will far exceed new purchases in the near term, so the negative-wealth effect will overwhelm the gains.
Given these large upfront costs, it is reasonable to ask how effective demonetization is in fighting tax evasion and corruption, and if there is a less costly approach to demonetization.
Back in 1976, in an article entitled “How to Make the Mob Miserable,” the American economist James S. Henry addressed the question of effectiveness, prescribing demonetization as a measure to undermine mafia operations.
But policymakers did not take his proposal seriously.
Henry’s proposal was, in his own words, “dismissed as either administratively impractical or as a one-shot action that would have no long-run impact on criminal behavior.”
In a new book, The Curse of Cash, Kenneth Rogoff champions the elimination of high-denomination notes in order to fight tax evasion and criminal activity.
Rogoff furnishes extensive evidence that making it costly to hoard cash would deter illegal activities.
While tax evaders also store their wealth in non-monetary forms, such as land, art, and jewelry, cash remains a leading vehicle for ill-gotten gains, owing to its inherent liquidity.
In other words, questions posed by Modi’s critics about the role of cash in feeding stockpiles of black money are misplaced.
That said, Rogoff proposes a different strategy to address the menace of black money – one that would be minimally disruptive and arguably more effective, at least in the long run.
That strategy would depart from the Modi government’s intervention in two fundamental ways.
First, it would be gradualist, implemented over several years.
Second, it would permanently eliminate high-denomination notes.
While this gradualist strategy would not punish existing hoarders, who would find creative ways to recycle their cash in the interim, it is more likely to improve tax compliance and reduce corruption over time, as large-denomination notes are permanently taken out of circulation.
India’s current policy of replacing 1,000-rupee notes with 2,000-rupee notes undermines the long-term effectiveness of its policy.
Moreover, the gradualist approach is administratively practical, minimizes the collateral damage to the real economy and ensures that there is enough time to extend financial services and financial literacy to larger parts of India.
Over the last two years, the Modi government has made an impressive push for financial inclusion with its Jan Dhan program, which has facilitated the creation of 220 million new bank accounts.
But many people who create accounts do not necessarily use them.
A 2015 World Bank study of bank-account usage and dormancy rates across different regions found that only 15% of Indian adults reported using an account to make or receive payments.
In this environment, a cash scarcity is economically crippling.
Modi’s policy intervention is bold, and the economic principles motivating it are beyond reproach.
But a gradualist approach that includes the permanent withdrawal of large notes would have served the cause better, even if it did not generate the same “shock and awe” as the current policy.
This will become more apparent as the large costs to the economy emerge over the next several months.
India with 1.5 Billion People
India's population is now a little over one billion; it will almost certainly surpass 1.5 billion by mid-century, overtaking China's population along the way before it stops growing.
But, as worrying as this might appear, this actually represents a considerable demographic slowdown: India's population more than tripled during the past sixty years. Moreover, the economy is growing much faster than before.
So will India be able to provide a comfortable home for 1.5 billion people?
I recently co-authored a study (with Tim Dyson, Leela Visaria and others) that concludes, with modest optimism, that while India can manage its population growth, it also faces a number of major difficulties.
True, poverty fell in the 1990's, while literacy rates and school attendance rose.
But they did so unevenly.
Most of India's big poor states - Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh - suffer from a combination of relatively slow economic growth and rapid demographic growth.
Only Rajasthan's economy has kept pace with the rest of the country; the other four have not benefited much from trade and regulatory liberalization.
Similarly, states where birth rates fell earlier, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, are already enjoying shrinking school-age populations, whereas school-age numbers in Bihar will still be rising until around 2025.
But the majority of children in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are already in school, while in Bihar they are not.
These five poor states contain 45% of India's population, and 56% of its poor.
Our projections indicate that in 20 years they will account for more than half the population and 75% of the poor.
Unless recent trends can be reversed, the growing economic and demographic gulf between India's North and East and its South and West will pose a serious political threat.
The environmental impact of 1.5 billion inhabitants forms the other major challenge.
India's past population growth has been accompanied - if much too slowly and unequally - by improving health, education, and economic welfare.
But the environment has been suffering.
Our study concludes that India can have faster economic and industrial growth, higher rates of energy consumption, and a cleaner environment.
But this is not what has happened so far.
Air, soil, and water pollution has been growing, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths every year.
The key to a clean future is clean technologies, whose costs have been falling steadily, and will continue to do so.
Sometimes these technologies pay for themselves and will be adopted. But Indian producers and transporters will not invest in them if they bear the costs, while the public at large receives the benefits.
In these cases, government will have to provide incentives, or regulate and tax.
Unfortunately, however, when the main beneficiaries are the poor, corporations are powerful, and governments are weak or corrupt, good environmental practices are far from guaranteed.
There are nonetheless some notable success stories.
Delhi's barely breathable air has become tolerable, following a big move to compressed natural gas in public transport, retirement of old vehicles, and higher emissions standards in new ones.
Delhi's cleaner air hasn't cost much, yet other cities have been slow to follow suit.
The biggest problem is water pollution, with discharges into canals and rivers growing faster than treatment capacity.
At the same time, India's growing population will make increasing demands on water supplies - mainly for agriculture, which absorbs more than 80% of all the fresh water India consumes.
If the population grows by 50%, the country will need to grow 50% more food, if it is to continue to feed itself.
But there won't be any more water.
In fact, there could well be less water than there is now, owing to pollution and climate change.
So India will need huge increases in water efficiency.
Here, too, there are examples of improvement.
But there is also far too much populist politicking, with promises of free water for farmers.
Doing what has to be done to ensure sustainable water supplies - controlling pollution, encouraging conservation, regulating and charging where necessary - is politically tough.
Eventually, however, India has no choice: there are already sporadic riots over water shortage, while water tankers move under armed guard in some cities, and virulent conflicts arise between communities over water-sharing.
In questionnaires, the poor say that an adequate water supply is their foremost need.
But one fears that something more dreadful than the daily misery must occur before India's politicians decide to act.
Our study quotes three national water surveys.
Each concludes that India can have a satisfactory water future.
As with the other challenges posed by population growth, the issue is not whether the future can be managed, but whether it will be.
India may or may not be the world's next economic wonder; but it will have to solve its age-old problems, as well as its new ones, if it is going to be a good place to live for the vast majority of its citizens.
Time for India to Stretch its Wings
WASHINGTON, DC – Imagine you are a parent with a large number of children and limited resources.
Your oldest child is mature enough to move out of your home, but he does not want to.
So he stays, consuming resources that his siblings desperately need.
Is it right to allow your other children to suffer because their big brother is reluctant to strike out on his own?
A similar dynamic is playing out between the World Bank and the recipients of its International Development Association program.
IDA supports equitable growth in poor countries by providing low-interest, long-term loans and grants to national governments.
The program supports 77 of the poorest countries in the world – half of which are in Africa.
It also provides assistance to one country that no longer deserves it: India.
At the end of the 2014 fiscal year, India officially graduated from the IDA program, because it was no longer poor enough to qualify.
The World Bank sets a threshold for receiving assistance, based on per capita gross national income (GNI).
In the fiscal year 2016, the threshold is $1,215.
India’s per capita GNI has exceeded the World Bank’s limit each year since 2010.
In 2014, it was $1,570.
India is also considered creditworthy, giving it access to international capital markets.
And yet India continues to receive $3.2 billion over a three-year period in transitional support from the IDA program, even as other poor countries plead for more funds.
In the 2015 fiscal year, India was allocated 11.5% percent of the $14.6 billion provided by the IDA program, leaving the other 77 recipients to divide the remaining 88.5%.
There is no reason that India should be given this exceptional treatment.
The IDA funds it receives would be better spent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the needs are greater and the financing options are more limited.
If India’s FY15 allocation were divided equally among the remaining IDA countries, each would enjoy an average funding increase of more than 13%.
Funding for just the top five Sub-Saharan African IDA borrowers – Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana – would increase by about $0.5 billion.
This would be enough to finance 2,166 kilometers of paved roads, the distance from South Africa to Zambia in just one year.
One can only imagine the cumulative impact of sustaining such an increase in funding over the next 5 or 10 years.
The World Bank’s 2016 graduation policy review states that the funds being given to India are intended to smooth its transition from receiving IDA by preventing a sudden drop in financing.
India can handle the anticipated drop off.
It is substantially wealthier than its Sub-Saharan peers, and it boasts nearly $400 billion in international reserves.
Some argue that, because a large share of the world’s poor live in middle-income countries, the donor community should rethink how funding is directed.
Ravi Kanbur, a professor at Cornell University and a former World Bank chief economist for Africa, has called for resetting the IDA graduation policy.
He points out that in a world in which inequality is increasing within states, using a country’s overall wealth as a gauge of poverty neglects millions of poor people.
I agree.
And yet, according to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, India’s poverty rate, at 21.9%, is less than half that of Sub-Saharan Africa’s 44.4% rate – meaning that money is nonetheless better spent helping poorer countries in the region.
The solution for countries like India is to find better ways to redistribute their wealth, so that more of their citizens can benefit from it.
Wealthy countries have more options to help their poor.
India, in particular, has access to other sources of development finance, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the newly launched Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the BRICS’ New Development Bank.
IDA should be reserved for poor countries for which regular market access is blocked.
This is not about India per se.
African countries like Zambia, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana are expected to graduate soon – and should be prepared to adhere to the same rules when they do.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has urged donor countries to step up their support of IDA during this year’s triennial replenishment round, arguing that additional funding “will be essential for us to work on our goals to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.”
He listed both Africa and South Asia as important areas of focus.
Sub-Saharan African leaders need to ensure that the World Bank’s words translate into action.
They should lobby for accelerated and timely graduation for countries like India and make sure that the Bank lives up to its mission to serve poor countries.
Allowing countries to hang onto IDA for years, as India has done, means there is little recourse for those with much larger needs.
If the World Bank did not send 12 cents out of every dollar of IDA funding to India, it would have ample resources to invest in Africa – even if donations remained flat.
IDA’s transitional support to India is scheduled to end in 2017.
It is time for big brother to leave home for good.
This commentary was revised on May 26, 2016.
The previous version had assumed a scenario in which India’s total (three-year) allocation was re-allocated to the remaining IDA recipients in fiscal year 2015.
The new scenario is more conservative and re-allocates only India’s FY15 funds to the remaining IDA countries in that same fiscal year.
Social Benefits in the Age of Uber
PARIS – When it comes to compensation, the company you work for often matters more than how good you are at what you do.
In 2013, the average employee of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, earned $383,000 – much higher than what the best-performing employee in most firms can hope to take home.
Pay differences across companies are considerable.
Research by Jason Furman, US President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser, and Peter Orszag, Obama’s former budget director, has found that rising pay differentials are the prime cause of widening US wage inequality in recent decades. They account for a larger part of the rise in overall income inequality than wage differences within companies or capital income.
At the other end of the spectrum, many labor-force participants are on temporary contracts, work for small firms, or are self-employed.
Some combine different jobs at the same time.
If, as expected by many, the so-called sharing economy develops, their number is bound to grow.
These workers do not benefit from job security and generally earn much less.
Emerging countries offer the example of blatant inequality between employees in the formal sector – companies like Petrobras in Brazil and Infosys in India – and those who work in the informal economy.
But even in advanced economies, where social protection is broad in scope, access to benefits is far from equal.
Employees of large, profitable firms tend to enjoy better health-care coverage, more generous pensions, and easier access to training.
Moreover, some benefits – for example, parental leave – are conditional on seniority within a company.
These are disturbing facts.
Talent and effort should be rewarded, but two people of equal capabilities and dedication should not be treated differently just because one happens to be an insider, with a secure job in a big, successful company.
Such differences are questionable not only in terms of fairness; they are also economically inefficient, because they tend to limit labor mobility across firms and sectors.
Employees may think twice before leaving a company if they are set to lose valuable perks as a consequence.
This prevents potentially positive matching of the skills needed by employers and the available supply of them. It also makes hiring first-class talent excessively difficult for small companies.
Public policy should not prevent successful companies from paying more and offering better working conditions.
But it should ensure that all participants in the labor force, whatever their status, enjoy equal access to essential benefits; and it should aim at minimizing the losses that impede mobility across firms, sectors, and types of employment.
Obama’s health-care reform was an important step in this regard. But social-welfare reforms should go much further.
For fairness as well as for efficiency reasons, rights and benefits should be attached to individuals, not to companies or employment status, and should be fully portable across sectors and jobs.
To attune its social-welfare system to a changing economy and reduce inequality among individuals, France is currently considering a system of so-called Individual Activity Accounts (IAAs).
My colleague Selma Mahfouz chaired a committee that prepared a blueprint for such a system.
Put simply, every new labor-force entrant would be equipped with a lifelong individual account, thereby accumulating points in the same way airline travelers accumulate miles. They would earn them by working in both the private and public sector.
Physically strenuous jobs would yield more points than office jobs.
Pro bono community service would also generate points – perhaps more than paid jobs.
Points earned could be spent on lifelong education and professional training, which would thus become independent from employment status.
Every person could decide to draw on her IAA to prepare for, or when making, a job change.
Other financing could also be mobilized toward the same end.
For example, an employee could decide to shorten the duration of his unemployment benefits and invest the corresponding points to benefit from better education opportunities.
But financing education should not be the only purpose.
Points could also be used to help finance volunteerism or care for elderly family members.
Points earned through hard toil could be spent on retiring earlier. Many more examples of partial fungibility could be imagined.
Such a system would have three additional benefits.
First, it would help improve access to information.
Employees nowadays are often lost in the complexity of the various social benefits to which they are entitled.
The creation of IAAs and the adoption of a single unit of account would go a long way toward making things simpler, especially if all relevant individual information is available to users via a single smartphone app.
Second, IAAs would empower employees, especially the least skilled, who often perceive themselves as being in a state of subjection.
Together with information, the possibility to invest their social benefits, rather than only consuming them, would strengthen their autonomy and freedom of choice.
Finally, the same accounts could serve as vehicles for public policy.
For example, early school-leavers could be endowed with points for later use in professional training.
More broadly, instead of assisting people only when social risks materialize, public policy could support individuals throughout their working life, by adopting a more effective bespoke approach that fits peoples’ needs better than coarsely tailored schemes.
This may sound utopian; in a way, it is.
But at a time when every digital service becomes more and more personalized, why should social policy remain confined to the philosophy and solutions of the twentieth century?
Putting out Indonesia’s Fires
MANILA – Every year, forest fires ravage Indonesia, causing massive environmental, social, and economic devastation.
This year’s fires are the largest in nearly 20 years, destroying three million hectares of land and causing an estimated $14 billion in losses related to agriculture, forest degradation, health, transportation, and tourism.
Perhaps even more alarming is the climate impact.
Indonesia is already among the world’s biggest carbon emitters.
Thanks to the fires, its daily average emissions this September and October were ten times higher than normal.
On October 14 alone, emissions from the fires soared to 61 megatons – nearly 97% of the country’s total emissions for that day.
As a result, this year’s fires – coming just weeks before the current United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where world leaders plan to finalize a global pact limiting carbon emissions – have underscored the urgent need for Indonesia and its development partners to act quickly to address this regional and global scourge.
If we don’t, climate change will be even more difficult to combat.
The cause of Indonesia’s recurring infernos is the common practice of lighting fires to clear land for palm oil production, exacerbated by a prolonged dry spell partly attributable to El Niño.
While stricter enforcement of rules against deliberate fires in Indonesia’s 1999 Basic Forestry Law and the 2014 Law on Plantations will help, far more needs to be done.
The reason is simple: Indonesia’s fires aren’t your typical forest fires.
The ground holds peat – dense organic matter in the process of becoming coal.
When the peat ignites, the fire can creep beneath the surface and erupt somewhere else, days or weeks later.
And, like coal, peat stores massive amounts of carbon, which is released into the atmosphere when the land is burned, cleared, and drained to make way for plantations.
The scale of the fires reflects the difficulty of the enforcement challenge the authorities face.
It is much cheaper for farmers to clear land with fire than by other means.
Moreover, farmers have few alternatives to operating palm oil or timber plantations.So every dry season, more and more land is burned.
And every year, the fallout widens.
An estimated 75 million people have been exposed to the smoke this year, and 500,000 in Indonesia alone are believed to have contracted fire-related respiratory illnesses.
Five key steps – all being actively debated in Indonesia – would help prevent the fires.
For starters, the licenses awarded to develop peatlands should be revoked, and concessions should be taken away from landholders if there are fires.
Moreover, a moratorium on new forest clearing should be enforced through local communities.
Re-wetting peatlands and the restoration of degraded peat forests should be the next step, followed by the creation of early warning systems to detect and control forest fires.
Finally, with the support of the private sector, Indonesia needs to establish a community-based forest management system.
Regional cooperation also holds great promise.
Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85% of the world palm oil market, have agreed to establish the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries, which will harmonize standards and promote environmentally sustainable production practices.
To build on this, consumers and markets also need to send signals to companies that directly or indirectly support slash-and-burn farming.
The 2014 Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge – in which five major producers committed to more sustainable solutions that preclude deforestation, respect human and community rights, and deliver shareholder value – is a good model.
Small farmers need options other than slash-and-burn farming to boost their meager incomes.
There is a clear need for an integrated land-management approach involving conservation, rehabilitation, investment in sustainable livelihoods, and institutional reforms.
There is also a growing consensus on the need for broader industry standards for sustainable production and processing of agricultural commodities.
Multilateral development institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have a role to play in providing support to ensure that systems, capacity, and market-access initiatives are undertaken in ways that improve compliance.
And national and local regulatory reforms that improve land-use planning, create incentives for forest conservation, and promote the use of low-carbon land must also be supported.
Indonesia is firmly committed to clean, sustainable development.
It recently pledged to reduce its CO2 emissions by 29% through unilateral measures by 2030, and by 41% with international support.
Putting out Indonesia’s forest fires for good will be crucial to meeting these targets.
For the sake of the planet, all of us need to grab a bucket.
Indonesia’s Forgotten Genocide
CANBERRA – October marked 50 years since the Indonesian military launched one of the twentieth century’s worst mass murders.
Yet the anniversary passed almost unnoticed.
The massacre of some 500,000 members or sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) during 1965-1966 is the least talked-about genocide of the last century.
Lifting the veil on the bloodbath is long overdue, but those with a past to hide seem bound to resist this.
Organizers of Bali’s renowned Ubud Writers and Readers Festival have just had a foretaste of what may be a new round of active censorship, with local officials threatening to cancel the entire festival if proposed panel discussions of the massacres went ahead.
The killings started in October 1965 in the aftermath of an abortive coup allegedly planned by the PKI.
The military reacted by portraying the party and its supporters as an atheist force of evil which had to be annihilated.
The resulting carnage was deliberate, systematic, and spanned the country, with the most horrific and intense violence in Central and East Java, Bali, and northern Sumatra.
This year also marks the centenary of the Armenian genocide, about which successive Turkish governments have maintained an indefensible denial.
But at least the fate of the more than one million Turkish Armenians killed outright or death-marched into the Syrian desert in 1915 for their wartime “disloyalty” remains the subject of immense international scrutiny, research, and advocacy.
By contrast, the Indonesian genocide remains the only killing of this scale that has not been the subject of minute international attention.
Nor, apart from a largely ignored National Human Rights Commission report in 2012, has there been any significant domestic truth-finding, let alone a reconciliation process or reparations.
The subject is avoided in history books, evaded by diplomats, and forms no part of domestic political discourse.
The story begins with an abortive coup on the night of September 30, 1965, when junior military officers, claiming to be protecting President Sukarno from a right-wing clique, captured and executed the army commander and five other high-ranking generals.
The following evening, Major General – later President – Suharto led a successful counter-coup.
Suharto’s action marked the beginning of the end of the Sukarno era, and the birth of his “New Order”: the pro-Western, business-friendly regime that would govern Indonesia for the next three decades.
Suharto and his associates immediately blamed the PKI as the masterminds of the “September 30 Movement,” and spread gruesome stories about the torture and mutilation of the executed officers.
Army-led and militia-implemented mass murders soon followed.
Controversy continues to this day as to who was actually responsible for the initial coup.
Candidates include Suharto himself (he certainly had some foreknowledge of events), acting with or without United States support, and even the British Foreign Office.
The balance of opinion among international scholars is that a small group around PKI leader Aidit was involved, but not in a way that even remotely implicated the entire party, or that could even begin to justify the bloody nationwide purge which followed.
With Suharto’s accession to power, Indonesia shifted almost overnight from being a strong voice for neutrality and anti-imperialism, actively courting the attention of the Soviet Union and Communist China, to becoming a more compliant partner with the US, which now saw Indonesia as a major stabilizing force in a volatile region.
As a result, there was no appetite among the US and its allies – including my own country, and the Australian government of which I was a member – to look closely, then or since, at how Suharto’s New Order consolidated its power.
Within Indonesia itself, even with the Suharto era long gone, anti-communist sentiment remains strong, survivors remain cowed, and demands for justice and accountability remain few.
Things may, however, be starting to change, especially following the release three years ago of Joshua Oppenheimer’s extraordinary documentary film, The Act of Killing.
Oppenheimer records, in meticulous and horrifying detail, a group of former death-squad leaders re-enacting the murders they committed – not, at least initially, in any spirit of confession or remorse, but rather to portray themselves as the heroes of a necessary process of national purification.
Some viewers are not persuaded of the film’s accuracy, or are troubled by the occasionally surreal character of the film-within-a-film structure adopted by the director.
But to me its essential truth resonates profoundly: The Act of Killing is the most haunting and emotionally lacerating documentary I have ever seen.
I hope that Oppenheimer’s film and its recently released follow-up, The Look of Silence, achieve the audience and impact they deserve – and not just at the world’s film festivals, but in Indonesia itself.
The Indonesian genocide – and it deserves to be so described, even if its impulse was ideological rather than ethnic, religious, or national – is an alarming case study in the politics of mass murder.
It shows what leaders can get away with when they demonize opponents, achieving conceivably defensible ends by morally atrocious means.
That is just one reason Indonesia’s campaign of killing demands much more of the world’s attention, and censure, than it has so far received.
The Plant-Based Solution to Hunger
BERLIN – The way we eat in the industrialized world is unhealthy, unjust, and unsustainable.
Far too much of the meat we consume is produced under questionable ecological, ethical, and social conditions.
And now our industrial model for meat production is being exported to the global south – especially India and China – where meat consumption is rising among these countries’ emerging middle classes.
Worldwide, 300 million tons of meat are produced each year, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that the annual amount will increase to 455 million tons by 2050 if demand continues to grow at the current rate.
Such large amounts of meat can be produced only on an industrial scale, and at high social, political, and ecological costs.
Meat production is a tremendously inefficient use of agricultural land, because considerably more plant-based food is needed to feed livestock than we would need to feed ourselves directly through a plant-based diet.
For example, producing one kilogram of chicken meat, pork, or beef requires 1.6, three, and eight kilograms of animal feed, respectively.
This pits farmers and animal-feed producers against one another in a fierce competition over land.
Meanwhile, the production of soy – the world’s most important animal-feed grain – rose from 130 million tons in 1996 to 270 million tons in 2015, with 80% of output going to meat production, especially in China (70 million tons) and Europe (31 million tons).
This expansion of soy agriculture, as a result of the growing demand for meat, is driving up land values.
Consequently, in the global south, common land is being privatized, rainforests are being destroyed to make room for agricultural cultivation, and international agribusinesses are expropriating the land that one-third of the world’s people still rely on for their livelihoods.
Animal-feed production, and the intensive cultivation of agricultural land that it requires, is not only destroying ecosystems and reducing biodiversity; it is also fueling climate change.
Worldwide, our industrial agriculture system produces an estimated 14% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions; including emissions indirectly linked to deforestation, and those associated with fertilizer production, increases that share to 24%.
Moreover, the extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides – 99% of the world’s soy is genetically modified, and is routinely treated with pesticides – is also contaminating ground-water sources, destroying biodiversity, and eroding the soil.
We can no longer ignore the external costs of this system.
If we are serious about addressing climate change and securing every human being’s right to proper nutrition and food security, we must challenge the presumption that an industrial agricultural model, let alone meat, is necessary to feed the world.
In fact, that presumption has little merit.
The UN Environment Programme estimates that, by 2050, an area between the size of Brazil and India will have to be repurposed into cropland if current food-consumption trends continue.
But if the 9.6 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by then were to have a plant-based diet, industrial meat production could be abandoned and all of them could be fed without the need for any additional agricultural land.
For many people, the competition for land is a fight for survival.
Land access, which is more unevenly distributed than incomes, is a deciding factor in whether someone suffers from malnutrition: 20% of households that experience hunger do not own land, and 50% of people who experience hunger are small-scale farmers.
The industrial agriculture system’s production chains must be replaced with local, decentralized, and sustainable production chains.
It is incumbent upon governments to prioritize people’s right to food and nutrition above private economic interests.
People should not lose their livelihoods and food security for the benefit of agribusiness profits.
To move toward an ecologically sustainable and socially equitable agricultural model, we can leverage existing political frameworks, such as the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy.
As it stands now, large-scale industrial meat producers are profiting extensively from EU subsidies; but these subsidies could be redirected as investments in decentralized meat and grain production chains that adhere to a more sustainable model.
Doing so requires recognizing that realistic alternatives to industrial agriculture do exist.
For example, “agroecology” – a system based on traditional and indigenous knowledge that is passed down through the generations – is easily adaptable to all geographic circumstances.
In fact, in 2006 Jules Pretty of the University of Essex found that this mode of production can increase harvest yields by 79%.
But, to implement this shift, governments must ensure that all people have guaranteed access to land and potable water, and they need to create political frameworks to promote ecologically and socially just agricultural models – which, by definition, excludes industrial agriculture.
The challenge of feeding every human being should not be viewed in opposition to – or as somehow ruling out – questions of social justice and the future of the planet.
Poverty, malnutrition, and hunger are a result of politics, not scarcity.
Industrialization’s Second Golden Age
WASHINGTON, DC – “The golden age of finance,” the economist Barry Eichengreen has said, “has now ended.”
If that is true – and let us hope that it is – what follows will most likely be a new golden age of industrialization.
Historically, except for a few oil-exporting economies, no country has ever become rich without industrializing.
Thus, all eyes nowadays should be on our economies’ real sectors.
Confronted by the global financial crisis that looms over Europe, political leaders around the world are waking up to a stark new reality: unless the developed countries stop relying excessively on financial deal-making and start to rebuild from the ground up, they will lose their current standard of living.
The global community must look beyond the eurozone and sovereign-debt crises and pay attention to the opportunity of structural transformation in the developing world’s real sectors.
By structural transformation, I mean the process by which countries climb the industrial ladder – their workforces move into higher value-added manufacturing sectors as their sources of production advance.
Throughout 2011, I was struck by the potential for less-developed countries – including in Sub-Saharan Africa – to emulate successful industrializing East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Vietnam.
Indeed, by focusing development efforts on the comparative advantages of poorer countries, we can rebuild confidence in the business sector and reinvigorate investment in job creation – not only in developing countries, but also in advanced economies.
The current global financial crisis, which is rooted in the advanced countries’ structural problems, requires investment and innovation policies, in addition to monetary or fiscal measures.
In advanced countries, research and development costs are quite high, because their technologies and industries are already in the vanguard.
By contrast, developing countries, including those in Sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to expand their industrial sectors rapidly, because they can borrow technology from the advanced countries with little risk and at low cost.
So developing countries’ backwardness in terms of technology and industry means that they can grow for decades at an annual rate several times that of high-income countries before they close the income gap.
This May, in Maputo, Mozambique, I delivered the United Nations University’s annual WIDER lecture on development.
I explained how the winning formula for developing countries is to build up the same tradable industries that have been growing for decades in wealthier countries that have endowment structures similar to their own.
The pattern of flying geese is a useful metaphor to explain this idea.
Beginning in the eighteenth century, the less-developed West European and East Asian countries followed their more successful neighbors: emulating a flying-geese pattern, they benefited from the leaders’ tailwind as they first industrialized and then became advanced countries themselves.
Large, dynamic emerging-market economies (particularly Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that have industrialized quickly offer unprecedented opportunities for other developing economies to emulate their success – and thus to jumpstart their own industrialization processes.
China – once a “follower goose” – is on the verge of becoming a leader, with the potential to relocate 85 million low-skilled manufacturing jobs in the coming decade.
The scale of this shift is huge when compared with the 9.7 million jobs that Japan created in the modern sector in the 1960’s, or South Korea’s 2.3 million modern jobs in the 1980’s.
And a similar trend will arise in other emerging-market economies.
In fact, it is already happening: China’s outward foreign direct investment reached $68 billion in 2010, exceeding that of Japan and the United Kingdom.
India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea are not far behind.
Moreover, India’s outward FDI is heavily concentrated in the manufacturing sector, accounting for 42.7% of the total in 1999-2008.
For developing countries to benefit fully from industrial upgrading in China and other large emerging-market economies, their governments must identify tradable industries that are consistent with their latent comparative advantage.
They also must help private firms to resolve information, coordination, and externality issues in the process of industrial upgrading.
Rapid industrialization in developing countries will require large imports of capital equipment from advanced countries.
Given that developing countries have accounted for as much as two-thirds of global growth in GDP and imports over the past five years, focusing on how to foster development in their industrial sectors could benefit advanced countries by helping to boost demand, thereby pulling the world out of its economic malaise.
In short, the imminent golden age of industrialization in developing countries will help to create jobs and spur recovery in advanced countries.
The benefits of this new era will be two-pronged: it will contribute to the achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals – the plan to cut world poverty in half by 2015 – and also will help to drive a global recovery.
Then, we may see a golden age for all.
Industrial Policy Comes Out of the Cold
WASHINGTON, DC – One of the best-kept economic secrets was strongly reconfirmed in 2010: most countries, intentionally or not, pursue an industrial policy in one form or other.
This is true not only of China, Singapore, France, and Brazil – countries usually associated with such policies – but also for the United Kingdom, Germany, Chile, and the United States, whose industrial policies are often less explicit.
Given that industrial policy broadly refers to any government decision, regulation, or law that encourages ongoing activity or investment in an industry, this should come as no surprise.
After all, economic development and sustained growth are the result of continual industrial and technological change, a process that requires collaboration between the public and private sectors.
Historical evidence shows that in countries that successfully transformed from an agrarian to a modern economy – including those in Western Europe, North America, and, more recently, in East Asia – governments coordinated key investments by private firms that helped to launch new industries, and often provided incentives to pioneering firms.
Even before the recent global financial crisis and subsequent recession, governments around the world provided support to the private sector through direct subsidies, tax credits, or loans from development banks in order to bolster growth and support job creation.
Policy discussions at many high-level summits sought to strengthen other features of industrial policy, including public financing of airports, highways, ports, electricity grids, telecommunications, and other infrastructure, improvements in institutional effectiveness, an emphasis on education and skills, and a clearer legal framework.
The global crisis has led to a rethinking of governments’ economic role.
The challenge for industrial policy is greater, because it should assist the design of efficient, government-sponsored programs in which the public and private sectors coordinate their efforts to develop new technologies and industries.
But history also tells us that while governments in almost all developing countries have attempted to play that facilitating role at some point, most have failed.
The economic history of the former Soviet Union, Latin America, Africa, and Asia has been marked by inefficient public investment and misguided government interventions that have resulted in many “white elephants.”
These pervasive failures appear to be due mostly to governments’ inability to align their efforts with their country’s resource base and level of development.
Indeed, governments’ propensity to target overly ambitious industries that were misaligned with available resources and skills helps to explain why their attempts to “pick winners” often resulted in “picking losers.”
By contrast, governments in many successful developing countries have focused on strengthening industries that have done well in countries with comparable factor endowments.
Thus, the lesson from economic history and development is straightforward: government support aimed at upgrading and diversifying industry must be anchored in the requisite endowments.
That way, once constraints on new industries are removed, private firms in those industries quickly become competitive domestically and internationally.
The question then becomes how to identify competitive industries and how to formulate and implement policies to facilitate their development.
In developed countries, most industries are advanced, which suggests that upgrading requires innovation.
Support for basic research, and patents to protect successful innovation, may help.
For developing countries, Célestin Monga and I have recently developed an approach – called the growth identification and facilitation framework – that can help developing-country governments increase the probability of success in supporting new industries.
This framework suggests that policymakers identify tradable industriesthat have performed well ingrowing countrieswith similar resources and skills, and with a per capita income about double their own.
If domesticprivate firms in these sectors are already present, policymakers should identify and remove constraints on those firms’ technological upgrading or on entry by other firms.
In industries where no domestic firms are present, policymakers should aim to attract foreign direct investment from the countries being emulated or organize programs for incubating new firms.
The government should also pay attention to the development by private enterprises of new and competitive products, and support the scaling up of successful private-sector innovations in new industries.
In countries with a poor business environment, special economic zones or industrial parks can facilitate firm entry, foreign direct investment, and the formation of industrial clusters.
Finally, the government might help pioneering firms in the new industries by offering tax incentives for a limited period, co-financing investments, or providing access to land or foreign exchange.
Our approach provides policymakers in developing countries with a framework to tackle the daunting coordination challenges inherent in the creation of new, competitive industries. It also has the potential to nurture a business environment conducive to private-sector growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.
As economies around the world struggle to maintain or restore growth in 2011, industrial policy is likely to be under a brighter spotlight than ever before.
Given the right framework, there is no reason for it to remain in the shadows.
Inequality and Discontent
In the last two decades, the world as a whole has gotten richer, but, while some national economies have advanced sharply, others have fallen farther behind.
The increase in aggregate wealth has not led to the abolition, or even reduction, of poverty.
Much the same is true within countries.
Almost everywhere, globalization has produced both a new class of multi-millionaires and an underclass comprising people who are not just poor in the statistical sense of earning less than half the national average, but who are excluded from opportunities that are supposed to be open to all.
Globalization’s dynamism has benefited many, but it has also increased inequality.
Is that necessarily a bad thing?
There are many who think so.
In fact, entire countries have a built-in egalitarian streak.
They dislike the business leaders who take home huge sums even when they fail, and they hate to see poor and excluded people in their midst.
But, while it is comfortable to live in the social-democratic world of Scandinavia, Germany, and other European countries, many of them have purchased their equality on credit from future generations.
Moreover, an egalitarian climate does not promote innovation and a sense of dynamic development.
Creative individuals tend to leave societies in which there is strong pressure not to be different.
Inequality is not merely compatible with freedom, but is often a result of and stimulus for freedom.
Is that the choice we have to make then: freedom or equality?
Things are not quite so simple.
A free society recognizes two limits to economic and general inequality.
Both raise quite difficult practical questions, though they are clear in principle.
Inequality is incompatible with freedom if it limits individuals’ chances of participation in the political community, in the market, and in civil society.
At the lower end of the social scale, this raises the old and vexing question of equality of opportunity.
What is clear is that everyone must have access to elections and political parties, to education and the labor market, and to the associations of civil society.
In short, citizenship in the full sense of the word requires basic rights and the ability to enforce them.
It also requires a basic economic status, including an income guarantee, which can be provided in a variety of ways.
One difficult question is where, exactly, to draw the line that defines the basic status to which all citizens are entitled.
In most countries, it should probably be higher than it is now.
Another difficult question is how the basic status is to be guaranteed.
The debate about individual income supplements versus general public services has become lively everywhere.
It may well be resolved with different answers that accord with different countries’ traditions, although tax credits and similar additions to people’s incomes are more compatible with free societies.
At the upper end of the social and economic scale, a different issue arises.
Many people object to business managers who take away in pay, bonuses, and stock options hundreds of millions of dollars from their companies.
Indeed, there is a legitimate question whether the behavior of today’s capitalists promotes the general acceptance of capitalism.
But individual wealth becomes a problem only if and when it can be used to restrict others’ chances of participation.
When wealth turns into unchecked power, something must be done to restrict it.
What has come to be called money laundering, that is, the attempt to turn illicit gains into legitimate riches, provides one example of the need for action.
There are others, including the question of inheritance taxes, which have long been regarded as a necessary component of a free society.
Nevertheless, while a free society recognizes limits to inequality, it also accepts that inequality exists, for it provides hope for many by showing what one might achieve with ability and luck – or perhaps even luck alone.
Inequality adds color and variety to societies; it is one of the marks of lively, flexible, and innovative countries.
It is thus not bad in itself, even if its excesses must be capped in the name of citizenship for all.
Social exclusion and personalized power through wealth are always unacceptable.
But if we want freedom, then social and economic inequalities are a legitimate, and necessary, price to pay.
Inequality on the March
How much should we worry about inequality?
Answering that question requires that we first answer another question: “Compared to what?”
What is the alternative against which to judge the degree of inequality that we see?
Florida is a much more materially unequal society than Cuba.
But the right way to look at the situation – if Florida and Cuba are our alternatives – is not to say that Florida has too much inequality, but that Cuba has much too much poverty.
On the global level, it is difficult to argue that inequality is one of the world’s major political-economic problems.
It is hard, at least for me, to envision alternative political arrangements or economic policies over the past fifty years that would have transferred any significant portion of the wealth of today’s rich nations to today’s poor nations.
I can easily envision alternatives, such as Communist victories in post-World War II elections in Italy and France that would have impoverished nations now in the rich North.
I can also envision alternatives that would have enriched poor nations: Deng Xiaoping becoming China’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there.
But alternatives that would have made the South richer at the price of reducing the wealth of the North would require a wholesale revolution in human psychology.
Nor should we worry a great deal that some people are richer than others.
Some people work harder, apply their intelligence more skillfully, or simply have been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.
But I don’t see what alternative political-economic arrangements could make individuals’ relative wealth closely correspond to their relative moral or other merit.
The problems that can be addressed are those of poverty and social insurance—of providing a safety net—not of inequality.
But on the level of individual societies, I believe that inequality does loom as a serious political-economic problem.
In the United States, the average earnings premium received by those with four-year college degrees over those with no college has gone from 30% to 90% over the past three decades, as the economy’s skill requirements have outstripped the educational system’s ability to meet them.
Because the required skills acquired through formal education have become relatively scarcer, the education premium has risen, underpinning a more uneven distribution of income and wealth.
Ceci Rouse and Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton University report that they find no signs that those who receive little education do so because education does not pay off for them: if anything, the returns to an extra year of schooling appear greater for those who get little education than for those who get a lot.
A greater effort to raise the average level of education in America would have made the country richer and produced a more even distribution of income and wealth by making educated workers more abundant and less-skilled workers harder to find – and thus worth more on the market.
Likewise, America’s corporate CEO’s and their near-peers earn ten times more today than they did a generation ago.
This is not because a CEO’s work effort and negotiation and management skills are ten times more valuable nowadays, but because other corporate stakeholders have become less able to constrain top managers and financiers from capturing more of the value-added.
Similar patterns are found elsewhere.
Within each country, the increase in inequality that we have seen in the past generation is predominantly a result of failures of social investment and changes in regulations and expectations, and has not been accompanied by any acceleration in the overall rate of economic growth.
For the most part, it looks like these changes in economy and society have not resulted in more wealth, but only in an upward redistribution of wealth—a successful right-wing class war.
This kind of inequality should be a source of concern.
Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, and the other millionaires and billionaires of Microsoft are brilliant, hardworking, entrepreneurial, and justly wealthy.
But only the first 5% of their wealth can be justified as an economic incentive to encourage entrepreneurship and enterprise.
The next 95% would create much more happiness and opportunity if it was divided evenly among US citizens or others than if they were to consume any portion of it.
An unequal society cannot help but be an unjust society.
The most important item that parents in any society try to buy is a head start for their children.
And the wealthier they are, the bigger the head start.
Societies that promise equality of opportunity thus cannot afford to allow inequality of outcomes to become too great.
The Inequality Puzzle
NEW YORK – Over the past decade, income inequality has come to be ranked alongside terrorism, climate change, pandemics, and economic stagnation as one of the most urgent issues on the international policy agenda.
And yet, despite all the attention, few potentially effective solutions have been proposed.
Identifying the best policies for reducing inequality remains a puzzle.
To understand why the problem confounds policymakers, it is helpful to compare the world’s two largest economies.
The United States is a liberal democracy with a market-based economy, in which the factors of production are privately owned.
China, by contrast, is governed by a political class that holds democracy in contempt.
Its economy – despite decades of pro-market reforms – continues to be defined by heavy state intervention.
But despite their radically different political and economic systems, the two countries have roughly the same level of income inequality.
Each country’s Gini coefficient – the most commonly used measure of income equality – is roughly 0.47.
In one important way, however, their situations are very different.
In the US, inequality is rapidly worsening.
In 1978, the top 1% of the US population was ten times richer than the rest of the country.
Today, the average income of the top 1% is roughly 30 times that of the average person in the remaining 99%.
During the same period, inequality in China has been declining.
This poses a challenge for policymakers.
Free market capitalism has proved itself to be the best system for driving income growth and creating a large economic surplus.
And yet, when it comes to the distribution of income, it performs far less well.
Most democratic societies have attempted to address the problem through left-leaning redistributive policies or right-leaning supply-side approaches.
But neither seems to be particularly effective.
In the US, income inequality has steadily widened under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
China’s success in this arena points to the possible advantages of its heavy-handed system – a conclusion that makes many Western policymakers uncomfortable.
One aspect of the discussion, however, need not be so controversial.
Adding to the challenges of the policy debate are assertions that inequality is unimportant.
If a rising tide is lifting all boats, the thinking goes, it doesn’t matter that some may be rising more slowly than others.
Those who argue for de-emphasizing income inequality maintain that public policy should seek to ensure that all citizens enjoy basic living standards – nutritious food, adequate shelter, quality health care, and modern infrastructure – rather than aiming to narrow the gap between rich and poor.
Indeed, some contend that income inequality drives economic growth and that redistributive transfers weaken the incentive to work, in turn depressing productivity, reducing investment, and ultimately harming the wider community.
But societies do not flourish on economic growth alone.
They suffer when the poor are unable to see a path toward betterment.
Social mobility in the US (and elsewhere) has been declining, undermining faith in the “American Dream” (which includes the belief that hard work will make one better off than one’s parents).
Over the past 30 years, the probability that an American born into the bottom quartile of the income distribution will end his life in the top quartile has more than halved.
To be sure, much progress has been made.
Over the past 50 years, as countries such as China and India posted double-digit economic growth, the global Gini coefficient dropped from 0.65 to 0.55.
But further headway is unlikely – at least for the foreseeable future.
Economic growth in most emerging economies has slowed below 7%, the threshold needed to double per capita income in a single generation.
In many countries, the rate has fallen below the point at which it is likely to make a significant dent in poverty.
This bleak economic outlook has serious consequences.
Widening inequality provides fodder for political unrest, as citizens watch their prospects decline.
Reports that just 158 wealthy donors provided half of all campaign contributions in the first phase of the 2016 US presidential election cycle highlight the worry that income inequality can lead to political inequality.
Globally, the slowdown in economic convergence has similar implications, as richer countries maintain their outsize influence around the world – leading to disaffection and radicalization among the poor.
As difficult a puzzle as income inequality may seem today, failing to solve it could lead to far more severe challenges.
In Europe We Distrust
MADRID – For decades, critics of the European Union have spoken about a democratic deficit.
I never accepted that reproach of the EU and its institutions, but I do see a new and dangerous deficit within the Union – a trust deficit, both among governments, and among the citizens of various member countries.&#160;Indeed, if today’s euro banknotes included a motto, as dollars do, it could well be, “In Europe We Distrust.”
This lack of trust has brought the eurozone to the cusp of implosion, and is calling into question the very future of European unity.
The arc of EU history seems to be bending to catastrophe – the sort of periodic European disaster that integration was intended to prevent.
Grandiloquent as it might sound, the disintegration of the euro and the disarray that would engulf the European project, not to speak of the global repercussions, would unleash comparable devastation.
But few official pronouncements, let alone policies, are addressing Europe’s deficit of trust and credibility.
The current crisis has exposed the original lacunae and widening cracks in the compact between Europe’s citizens and EU institutions, between Europe’s north and south, and between its peoples and its elites.
Indeed, a dangerous emotional discourse has emerged, reflecting – and feeding – the worst stereotypes of the “lazy South” and the “despotic North.”
It is indicative that the latest Pew Research Survey in late May reveals unanimity about who the least hardworking Europeans are: southerners, especially Greeks.
Likewise, polls and elections signal the ascent of populists across Europe, while financial markets’ vulture-like behavior stems from the cynical calculation that the EU lacks the wherewithal to restore its credibility.
That, after all, is the point of Europe’s straightjacket of austerity, which hampers its growth prospects, and thus makes little sense in economic terms.
The ultimate aim of austerity is precisely the restoration of trust – among northern Europeans that the money transferred to troubled economies will not be squandered, and among the peoples affected by painful spending cuts that their efforts are recognized and supported.
Speaking from the heartland of the troubled South, I can attest to the fact that the need for austerity has been the leitmotif of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government, a course that gained explicit popular support in the recent elections.
Reforming Spains’s cajas (savings banks), labor market, welfare provisions, and how its autonomous regions function top the national agenda (though unfortunately only at the insistence of the European Commission and Germany).
But restoring trust and credibility requires more than southern discipline.
Northern Europe must hold up its side of the bargain.
Germany, in particular, must acknowledge that, far from being an innocent victim, its economy is the eurozone’s biggest beneficiary – and has been since the euro’s inception.
That, together with the counterfactual – the economic calamity that would befall Germany following a collapse of the euro – implies a unique obligation to maintain it.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a favorite target of opponents of austerity for some time now, and it is understandable that, after months of being a bystander to the EU’s painful inability to govern, Germany has reluctantly – indeed, insufficiently – taken charge.
Looking ahead, as the threat of disintegration looms larger, the need for German leadership will be even greater.
But, once the crisis has passed, EU institutional reform will be a critical element in restoring trust.
The EU’s supposed democratic deficit is a corollary of the “technocratic imperative” that has emerged as a favorite scapegoat in the ongoing European drama.
According to this view, European integration was flawed from the outset, more than six decades ago, because it was conceived and developed as an elite project.
But, for as long as the European project delivered prosperity, no one bothered to question its rationale.
Today, however, the EU is the last point of reference as far as prosperity is concerned.
According to the Pew survey, EU favorability is down almost everywhere since 2007, having dropped 20 points in the Czech Republic and Spain, 19 points in Italy, and 14 points in Poland.
If EU institutions are to regain trust and relevance, they need to articulate concrete policies and deliver on issues that bear directly on citizens’ interests – youth unemployment, urban planning, health care, bio-tech research, energy conservation, transport, and aging.
All of these issues were an integral part of the EU’s ambitious Lisbon Strategy (which in 2000 promised to make Europe the world’s most competitive economy by 2010), and all were quickly hijacked by national political agendas.
That cannot be allowed to happen again.
In fact, there is nothing inevitable about the euro's failure.
The dismal image that Europe projects to the world nowadays does no justice to reality.
Europe has the world’s healthiest and most educated population, its largest economy, and huge stores of soft power, owing also to its commitment to human rights and democratic values.
And yet Europe is facing a calamity.
Discipline and morality may well be key to reinforcing trust and credibility to Europe’s social fabric – a point that northern Europeans never tire of making.
But, unless all Europeans accept responsibility for saving the euro – and, with it, the EU – everything else is shallow rhetoric.
The Inexorable Logic of the Sharing Economy
MILAN – When Amazon was founded in 1994, and eBay the following year, they harnessed the connectivity of the Internet to create new, more efficient markets.
In the beginning, that meant new ways of buying and selling books and collectibles; but now e-commerce is everywhere, offering customers new goods and used goods – and becoming a global force in logistics and retail.
Likewise, while today’s sharing-economy companies may be just out of their infancy, their services will one day be ubiquitous.
By now, most people have heard of Airbnb, the online apartment-rental service.
The company has just 600 employees but a million properties listed for rent, making it larger than the world’s biggest hotel chains.
Of course, what Airbnb offers is different from what hotels provide; but if Airbnb offered options for, say, maid service or food, they could become closer competitors than one might initially imagine.
The insight (obvious in retrospect) underlying Airbnb’s model – and the burgeoning sharing economy in general – is that the world is replete with under-utilized assets and resources.
How much time do we spend actually using the things – whether cars, bicycles, apartments, vacation homes, tools, or yachts – that we own?
What value do office buildings or classrooms generate at night?
Answers vary by asset, individual, household, or organization, but the utilization numbers tend to be astonishingly low.
One recent answer for cars was 8%, and even that may seem high to someone not burdened by long commutes.
But those numbers are changing, as the Internet enables creative new business models that increase not only a market’s efficiency but also the utilization of our various assets.
Hundreds of experiments are being conducted. Clearly, not all of them will experience the astonishing growth of Airbnb and Uber.
Some, like Rent the Runway for designer clothes and accessories, may find profitable niches; others will simply fail.
The digital platforms that act as the basis of all this e-commerce need to meet two related challenges.
The first is to produce a network effect, so that buyers and sellers find one another often enough and rapidly enough to make a business sustainable.
Second, the platform must create trust – in the product or the service – on both sides of the transaction.
Trust is crucial to the network effect; hence the need for two-way evaluation systems that encourage buyers and sellers to be repeat users of the relevant platform.
Small players can then act in large markets, because – over time – they become known quantities.
The power of these platforms derives from overcoming informational asymmetries, by dramatically increasing the signal density of the market.
Indeed, in order to encourage infrequent e-commerce users, innovators and investors are exploring ways to combine the evaluation databases of separate, even rival, platforms.
Whatever the legal and technical issues that must be overcome, down the road we can surely imagine the kind of data consolidation already practiced internally by retail giants like Amazon or Alibaba.
There can, of course, be other incentives to support “good” behavior, such as fines and deposits (for bicycles borrowed for too long or not returned, for example).
But punitive measures can easily lead to disputes and inefficiency. By contrast, refining evaluation systems holds far more promise.
The urge to exploit under-utilized resources should not be confined to material assets.
The McKinsey Global Institute has recently studied internet-based approaches to the labor market and the challenge of matching demand for talent and skills with supply.
Some sharing models – perhaps most – rely on both labor and other assets: for example, a person and his or her car, computer, sewing machine, or kitchen (for home-delivered meals).
This throwback to the cottage industries that preceded modern production is possible today because the Internet is lowering the costs of dispersion that once compelled the concentration of work in factories and offices.
Perhaps inevitably, regulatory issues arise, as Uber is now discovering from California to Europe.
Taxis and limousines are to some extent protected from competition because they need licenses to operate; they are also regulated for customer safety.
But then Uber invades their market with a differentiated product, subject largely to its own regulations for vehicles and drivers.
In the process, it threatens to lower the value of licenses just as surely as any official decision to issue new licenses would.
No wonder the taxi drivers of Paris and other French cities – hitherto protected from competition – have protested so vehemently (and, on occasion, violently).
An intriguing question is how far the financial sector will embrace the sharing economy.
Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding already represent new ways of matching borrowers with investors.
Clearly, issues relating to liability and insurance will have to be addressed in all sharing-economy models, especially financial ones; but these are hardly insurmountable obstacles.
The truth is that the Internet-led process of exploiting under-utilized resources – be they physical and financial capital or human capital and talent – is both unstoppable and accelerating.
The long-term benefits consist not just in efficiency and productivity gains (large enough to show up in macro data), but also in much-needed new jobs requiring a broad range of skills.
Indeed, those who fear the job-destroying and job-shifting power of automation should look upon the sharing economy and breathe a bit of a sigh of relief.
It might help to inform them that the estimated cost of emerging global infectious threats is $60 billion per year; if investments are made upfront, the total costs could be much smaller.
Inflation Comes to China
SHANGHAI – Macroeconomic conditions in any country are like running water.
How large and fast is the flow?
Where does it originate and where does it go?
The “main stream” of China’s economy is the vast flow of inward investment.
China’s economy is prone to rapid growth, with buoyant investment demand sustaining powerful short-term inflationary pressures.
As a result, credit controls on investment projects and a close watch on the money supply have been used to promote macroeconomic stability since China began its market reforms.
But in 2003, following five years of deflation, China’s economy entered a new phase.
Overcapacity vanished, constraints on consumption were lifted, and a dramatic increase in household demand followed.
Since then, heavy industries – steel, automobiles, machinery, building materials, energy, and raw materials – have experienced an unprecedented investment boom, reflecting demand for urban construction, housing, transport, infrastructure, and equipment renewal.
Not surprisingly, the economy began to overheat.
Productivity and profitability in manufacturing and heavy industries picked up, boosting China’s national savings dramatically.
Indeed, the huge increase in China’s trade surplus in recent years is a consequence not of the renminbi’s exchange rate, as many believe, but of the domestic savings’ increase.
Yet, from 2005 to early 2007, macroeconomic policy was focused on reining in the surplus.
Most importantly, the renminbi was allowed to appreciate, and the export tax rebate was virtually eliminated.
In early 2007, because inflation was not really visible, the government did not regard it as a major problem.
But when price increases accelerated in the second half of the year, the authorities began to worry.
The central bank (PBOC) initially attributed it to excess liquidity, and so began to use monetary policy tools, raising interest rates five times since late 2007.
As a result, the interest rate for 12-month fixed deposits has reached 3.9%.
Moreover, the PBOC has issued Central Bank Notes six times, reinforcing its anti-inflationary effort.
Nevertheless, by the end of October, M2 money supply had increased by 18.4% – growing by 1.3% faster year on year, and exceeding the 16% target.
By the start of 2008, it was clear that controlling inflation and cooling an overheating economy had become the government’s main economic target.
Indeed, the government’s key economic committee, the Central Work Committee, has concluded that after years of “high growth and low inflation,” China is on a route to “high growth with high inflation.”
This invariably means that fiscal and monetary stability will become a priority while controlling the trade surplus has become a lower one.
The problem is that, until now, the major cause of inflation has been rapidly rising manufacturing costs, and there is no sign of a slowdown in energy and raw material prices.
Moreover, a new labor law and income policies will further increase workforce costs.
And, due to rising consumer prices, the nominal interest rate will continue to rise.
As a result, with investment demand remaining robust, inflation could spread.
In the face of growing inflation, output is set to suffer.
In order to curb investment demand, tighter credit rationing and monetary policy are inevitable in 2008, while investment projects and land use will be subject to more rigorous control.
Likewise, increasing pressure from growing labor costs will force enterprises to lower their profit expectations and cut costs, negatively affecting output growth and employment in the short run.
It will be difficult to ease these inflationary pressures this year.
International commodity prices will continue to rise, increases in domestic labor costs and prices of non-tradable goods cannot easily be stemmed, the international economic situation will encourage further capital inflows, and asset inflation will persist.
All these factors will push inflation above the 2007 level.
With export performance also set to slow, owing to the economic downturn in the United States, employment and growth could be weakened further, which implies mounting pressure on China’s government – and thus on the fiscal deficit, creating another source of inflationary pressure.
And, once an inflationary trend emerges and economic growth slows, the steady- as-you go pattern to China’s decade-long boom will be over.
Inflation is Now the Lesser Evil
CAMBRIDGE – It is time for the world’s major central banks to acknowledge that a sudden burst of moderate inflation would be extremely helpful in unwinding today’s epic debt morass.
Yes, inflation is an unfair way of effectively writing down all non-indexed debts in the economy.
Price inflation forces creditors to accept repayment in debased currency.
Yes, in principle, there should be a way to fix the ills of the financial system without resort to inflation.
Unfortunately, the closer one examines the alternatives, including capital injections for banks and direct help for home mortgage holders, the clearer it becomes that inflation would be a help, not a hindrance.
Modern finance has succeeded in creating a default dynamic of such stupefying complexity that it defies standard approaches to debt workouts.
Securitization, structured finance, and other innovations have so interwoven the financial system’s various players that it is essentially impossible to restructure one financial institution at a time.
System-wide solutions are needed.
Moderate inflation in the short run – say, 6% for two years – would not clear the books.
But it would significantly ameliorate the problems, making other steps less costly and more effective.
True, once the inflation genie is let out of the bottle, it could take several years to put it back in.
No one wants to relive the anti-inflation fights of the 1980’s and 1990’s.
But right now, the global economy is teetering on the precipice of disaster.
We already have a full-blown global recession.
Unless governments get ahead of the problem, we risk a severe worldwide downturn unlike anything we have seen since the 1930’s.
The necessary policy actions involve aggressive macroeconomic stimulus.
Fiscal policy should ideally focus on tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
Central banks are already cutting interest rates left and right.
Policy interest rates around the world are likely to head toward zero; the United States and Japan are already there.
The United Kingdom and the euro zone will eventually decide to go most of the way.
Steps must also be taken to recapitalize and re-regulate the financial system.
Huge risks will remain as long as the financial system remains on government respirators, as is effectively the case in the US, UK, the euro zone, and many other countries today.&nbsp;
Most of the world’s largest banks are essentially insolvent, and depend on continuing government aid and loans to keep them afloat.
Many banks have already acknowledged their open-ended losses in residential mortgages.
As the recession deepens, however, bank balance sheets will be hammered further by a wave of defaults in commercial real estate, credit cards, private equity, and hedge funds.
As governments try to avoid outright nationalization of banks, they will find themselves being forced to carry out second and third recapitalizations.
Even the extravagant bailout of financial giant Citigroup, in which the US government has poured in $45 billion of capital and backstopped losses on over $300 billion in bad loans, may ultimately prove inadequate.&nbsp; When one looks across the landscape of remaining problems, including the multi-trillion-dollar credit default swap market, it is clear that the hole in the financial system is too big to be filled entirely by taxpayer dollars.&nbsp;
Certainly, a key part of the solution is to allow more banks to fail, ensuring that depositors are paid off in full, but not necessarily debt holders.
But this route is going to be costly and painful.
That brings us back to the inflation option.
In addition to tempering debt problems, a short burst of moderate inflation would reduce the real (inflation-adjusted) value of residential real estate, making it easier for that market to stabilize.
Absent significant inflation, nominal house prices probably need to fall another 15% in the US, and more in Spain, the UK, and many other countries.
If inflation rises, nominal house prices don’t need to fall as much.
Of course, given the ongoing recession, it may not be so easy for central banks to achieve any inflation at all right now.
Indeed, it seems like avoiding sustained deflation , or falling prices, is all they can manage.
Fortunately, creating inflation is not rocket science.
All central banks need to do is to keep printing money to buy up government debt.
The main risk is that inflation could overshoot, landing at 20 or 30% instead of 5-6%.
Indeed, fear of overshooting paralyzed the Bank of Japan for a decade.
But this problem is easily negotiated.
With good communication policy, inflation expectations can be contained, and inflation can be brought down as quickly as necessary.
It will take every tool in the box to fix today’s once-in-a-century financial crisis.
Fear of inflation, when viewed in the context of a possible global depression, is like worrying about getting the measles when one is in danger of getting the plague.
Inflation or Deflation?
CAMBRIDGE – The investors that I talk to these days are not sure whether to worry more about future inflation in the United States or about future deflation.
The good news is that the answer – for at least the next few years – is that investors should worry about “neither.”
America’s high rate of unemployment and the low rates of capacity utilization imply that there is little upward pressure on wages and prices in the US. And the recent rise in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and the British pound helps by reducing import costs.
Those who emphasize the risk of inflation often point to America’s enormous budget deficit.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the country’s fiscal deficit will average 5% of GDP for the rest of the decade, driving government debt to 90% of GDP, from less than 60% of GDP in 2009.
While those large fiscal deficits will be a major problem for the US economy if nothing is done to bring them down, they need not be inflationary.
Sustained budget deficits crowd out private investment, push up long-term real interest rates, and increase the burden on future taxpayers.
But they do not cause inflation unless they lead to excess demand for goods and labor.
The last time the US faced large budget deficits, in the early 1980’s, inflation declined sharply because of a tight monetary policy.
Europe and Japan now have both large fiscal deficits and low inflation.
The inflation pessimists worry that the government will actually choose a policy of faster price growth to reduce the real value of the government debt.
But such a strategy can work only in countries where the duration of the government’s debt is long and the interest rate on that debt is fixed.
That is because an increase in the inflation rate causes interest rates on new debt to rise by an equal amount. The resulting higher interest payments add to the national debt, offsetting the erosion of the real value of the existing debt caused by the higher inflation.
In the current situation, the US cannot reduce the real value of its government debt significantly by indulging in a bout of inflation, because the average maturity on existing debt is very short – only about four years.
And the projected fiscal deficits imply that the additional debt that will be issued during the next decade will be as large as the total stock of debt today.
So raising inflation is no cure for the government’s current debt or future deficits.
Those who worry about deflation note that the US consumer price index has not increased at all in the past three months. Why won’t that continue and feed on itself – as it has in Japan – as consumers delay spending in anticipation of even lower prices in the future?
And doesn’t Japan’s persistent deflation since the early 1990’s also show that, once it begins, deflation cannot be reversed by a policy of easy money or fiscal deficits?
But the recent weakness in US prices is very different from the situation that prevails in Japan.
Zero inflation for the past three months has been a one-time event driven by the fall in energy prices.
The other broad components of the consumer price index have increased in recent months, and the consumer price index is up about two percentage points over the past 12 months.
Moreover, surveys of consumer expectations show that US households expect prices to rise at more than 2% in both the coming year and the more distant future.
That expected inflation rate is consistent with the difference in interest rates between ordinary US government bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
With such expectations, consumers have no reason to put off purchases.
A second reason for relatively low inflation in recent years has been a temporary fall in the cost of production.
As firms shed workers during the economic downturn, output fell more slowly. The resulting rise in output per worker, together with slow wage growth, reduced unit labor costs.
That process is now coming to an end as employment rises.
So the good news is that the possibility of significant inflation or deflation during the next few years is low on the list of economic risks faced by the US economy and by financial investors.
But, while inflation is very likely to remain low for the next few years, I am puzzled that bond prices show that investors apparently expect inflation to remain low for ten years and beyond, and that they also do not require higher interest rates as compensation for the risk that the fiscal deficit will cause real interest rates to rise in the future.
The Deflation Bogeyman
CAMBRIDGE – The world's major central banks are currently obsessed with the goal of raising their national inflation rates to their common target of about 2% per year.
This is true for the United States, where the annual inflation rate was -0.1% over the past 12 months; for the United Kingdom, where the most recent data show 0.3% price growth; and for the eurozone, where consumer prices fell 0.6%.
But is this a real problem?
The sharp decline in energy prices is the primary reason for the recent drop in the inflation rate.
In the US, the core inflation rate (which strips out changes in volatile energy and food prices) was 1.6% over the last 12 months.
Moreover, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank understand that even if energy prices do not rise in the coming year, a stable price level for oil and other forms of energy will cause the inflation rate to rise.
In the US, the inflation rate has also been depressed by the rise in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies, which has caused import prices to decline.
This, too, is a “level effect," implying that the inflation rate will rise once the dollar's exchange rate stops appreciating.
But, despite this understanding, the major central banks continue to maintain extremely low interest rates as a way to increase demand and, with it, the rate of inflation.
They are doing this by promising to keep short-term rates low; maintaining large portfolios of private and government bonds; and, in Europe and Japan, continuing to engage in large-scale asset purchases.
The central bankers justify their concern about low inflation by arguing that a negative demand shock could shift their economies into a period of prolonged deflation, in which the overall price level declines year after year.
That would have two adverse effects on aggregate demand and employment.
First, the falling price level would raise the real value of the debts that households and firms owe, making them poorer and reducing their willingness to spend.
Second, negative inflation means that real interest rates rise, because central banks cannot lower the nominal interest rate below zero.
Higher real interest rates, in turn, depress business investment and residential construction.
In theory, by depressing aggregate demand, the combination of increased real debt and higher real interest rates could lead to further price declines, leading to even larger negative inflation rates.
As a result, the real interest rate would rise further, pushing the economy deeper into a downward spiral of falling prices and declining demand.
Fortunately, we have relatively little experience with deflation to test the downward-spiral theory.
The most widely cited example of a deflationary economy is Japan.
But Japan has experienced a low rate of inflation and some sustained short periods of deflation without ever producing a downward price spiral.
Japan's inflation rate fell from nearly 8% in 1980 to zero in 1987.
It then stayed above zero until 1995, after which it remained low but above zero until 1999, and then varied between zero and -1.7% until 2012.
Moreover, low inflation and periods of deflation did not prevent real incomes from rising in Japan.
From 1999 to 2013, real per capita GDP rose at an annual rate of about 1% (which reflected a more modest rise of real GDP and an actual decline in population).
Why, then, are so many central bankers so worried about low inflation rates?
One possible explanation is that they are concerned about the loss of credibility implied by setting an inflation target of 2% and then failing to come close to it year after year.
Another possibility is that the world's major central banks are actually more concerned about real growth and employment, and are using low inflation rates as an excuse to maintain exceptionally generous monetary conditions.
And yet a third explanation is that central bankers want to keep interest rates low in order to reduce the budget cost of large government debts.
None of this might matter were it not for the fact that extremely low interest rates have fueled increased risk-taking by borrowers and yield-hungry lenders.
The result has been a massive mispricing of financial assets.
And that has created a growing risk of serious adverse effects on the real economy when monetary policy normalizes and asset prices correct.
The Information Revolution Gets Political
NEW DELHI – The second anniversary of the “Arab Spring” in Egypt was marked by riots in Tahrir Square that made many observers fear that their optimistic projections in 2011 had been dashed.
Part of the problem is that expectations had been distorted by a metaphor that described events in short-run terms.
If, instead of “Arab Spring,” we had spoken of “Arab revolutions,” we might have had more realistic expectations.
Revolutions unfold over decades, not seasons or years.
Consider the French Revolution, which began in 1789.
Who would have predicted that within a decade, an obscure Corsican soldier would lead French armies to the banks of the Nile, or that the Napoleonic Wars would disrupt Europe until 1815?
If we think of the Arab revolutions, there are many surprises yet to come.
So far, most Arab monarchies have had enough legitimacy, money, and force to survive the waves of popular revolt that have brought down secular republican autocrats like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, but we are only two years into the revolutionary process.
Beneath the Arab political revolutions lies a deeper and longer process of radical change that is sometimes called the information revolution.
We cannot yet fully grasp its implications, but it is fundamentally transforming the nature of power in the twenty-first century, in which all states exist in an environment that even the most powerful authorities cannot control as they did in the past.
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information, and our age is hardly the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology.
Gutenberg’s printing press was important to the origins of the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing wars in Europe.
Today, however, a much larger part of the population, both within and among countries, has access to the power that comes from information.
The current global revolution is based on rapid technological advances that have dramatically decreased the cost of creating, finding, and transmitting information.
Computing power doubled roughly every 18 months for 30 years, and, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, it cost one-thousandth of what it did in the early 1970’s.
If the price of automobiles had fallen as quickly as the price of semiconductors, a car today would cost $5.
As recently as the 1980’s, phone calls over copper wire could carry only one page of information per second; today, a thin strand of optical fiber can transmit 90,000 volumes in a second.
In 1980, a gigabyte of data storage occupied a room; now, 200 gigabytes of storage fits in your shirt pocket.
Even more crucial has been the enormous drop in the cost of transmitting information, which reduces barriers to entry.
As computing power has become cheaper and computers have shrunk to the size of smart phones and other portable devices, the decentralizing effects have been dramatic.
Power over information is much more widely distributed today than even a few decades ago.
As a result, world politics is no longer the sole province of governments.
Individuals and private organizations – including WikiLeaks, multinational corporations, NGOs, terrorists, or spontaneous social movements – have been empowered to play a direct role.
The spread of information means that informal networks are undercutting the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy, with all governments less able to control their agendas.
Political leaders enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events, and must then communicate not only with other governments, but with civil society as well.
But it would be a mistake to “over-learn” the lessons that the Arab revolutions have taught about information, technology, and power.
While the information revolution could, in principle, reduce large states’ power and increase that of small states and non-state actors, politics and power are more complex than such technological determinism implies.
In the middle of the twentieth century, people feared that computers and new means of communications would create the kind of central governmental control dramatized in George Orwell’s 1984.
And, indeed, authoritarian governments in China, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere have used the new technologies to try to control information.
Ironically for cyber-utopians, the electronic trails created by social networks like Twitter and Facebook sometimes make the job of the secret police easier.
After its initial embarrassment by Twitter in 2009, the Iranian government was able to suppress the country’s “green” movement in 2010.
Similarly, while the “great firewall of China” is far from perfect, the government has managed thus far to cope, even as the Internet has burgeoned in the country.
In other words, some aspects of the information revolution help the small, but some help the already large and powerful.
Size still matters.
While a hacker and a government can both create information and exploit the Internet, it matters for many purposes that large governments can deploy tens of thousands of trained people and have access to vast computing power to crack codes or intrude into other organizations.
Likewise, while it is now cheap to disseminate existing information, the collection and production of new information often requires major investment, and, in many competitive situations, new information matters most.
Intelligence collection is a good example, and the elaborate Stuxnet worm that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges seems to have been a government creation.
Governments and large states still have more resources than information-empowered private actors, but the stage on which they play is more crowded.
How will the ensuing drama unfold?
Who will win, and who will lose?
It will take decades, not a single season, to answer such questions.
As events in Egypt and elsewhere have shown, we are only just beginning to comprehend the effects of the information revolution on power in this century.
The Truth about Medical Consent
LONDON – Is it acceptable for doctors to withhold information from their patients?
Some claim that it is not only acceptable; it is desirable.
Hope, they argue, is critical to aid recovery, and a bleak diagnosis should not be allowed to kill it.
In his influential 1803 text Medical Ethics, the English physician Thomas Percival described the doctor’s role as “the minister of hope and comfort to the sick,” noting that at times they should conceal alarming information from their patients.
A patient’s life, Percival wrote, can be shortened not only by a doctor’s acts, but also by his words and manner.
The Canadian physician William Osler (whose patients included Walt Whitman) was another fervent believer in the healing power of hope.
Indeed, his “unfailing but occasionally unwarranted optimism,” a biographer noted, was one of his most outstanding characteristics.
In a 1958 textbook on medical ethics and law, another eminent doctor stated that it is “often clinically wise and in the patient’s interest to withhold certain matters.”
A few years ago, I interviewed a family doctor on the same subject.
He described his first “house call” in the 1960s, when he and a senior colleague visited a jovial protestant minister who had no idea that he only had weeks to live, owing to aggressive colon cancer.
The senior doctor suggested giving the patient large doses of painkillers, which they would tell the patient were antibiotics to treat an “infection.”
The junior doctor, uncomfortable with this deceit, asked the minister’s wife for permission to tell the truth, and after much hesitation, she agreed.
When the minister heard the news, he fell into a state of such despair that he refused all painkillers.
He was sure he would end up in hell.
More than 40 years later, that doctor told me: “To this day, I can see his face.
It was the biggest mistake of my medical career.”
Nowadays, this kind of medical paternalism is no longer the rule in many countries.
To avoid exposing themselves to claims of negligence or even, in rare cases, criminal assault, doctors must disclose an ever increasing amount of information, however bleak, about treatment risks, benefits, and alternatives, enabling the patient to give “informed consent.”
Maintaining a patient’s hope while fulfilling the obligation of disclosure is one of the most difficult tasks doctors face.
It requires a deep knowledge of the human heart; a single word, a gesture, or a look can lift or wreck a patient’s spirits.
Many doctors struggle to obtain proper consent.
One problem is that doctors receive little formal training in obtaining consent, with medical schools teaching only the basics.
As a result, many doctors are unaware of the subtleties of what constitutes valid consent in the eyes of the law and their professional body – a task made more difficult by the evolving rules on consent.
Another problem is that many doctors consider obtaining consent to be a tedious obligation, with senior doctors sometimes delegating the task to less experienced colleagues.
Moreover, doctors often obtain consent hastily, in a way that sounds almost rehearsed, as if unaware that the patient is receiving the information for the first time.
This haughty attitude is reflected in the jargon of “consenting a patient” – as though it were something done to a patient, like drawing blood or administering an injection: “Dr. Smith, please go consent Mr. Jones.”
Instead, consent should be viewed as a patient’s cherished possession, which he or she may choose to relinquish, if presented with a sufficiently compelling case.
Consent should not be snatched away, like a train ticket held out for the conductor.
The problem is compounded when consent is obtained just hours before a major operation, and months after the last consultation with the surgeon.
This can lead patients to consent to procedures that they do not understand – or want.
A colleague shared the story of a patient who told the porter pushing her on a trolley to the operating theater that she had been looking forward to the operation.
Once she was “cured,” she said, she could start a family.
She was just a few feet away from a hysterectomy.
The porter immediately called the medical team, and the operation was postponed.
Either the patient was not given the information, or she did not fully understand it.
As patients, future patients, or relatives, we all have an interest in raising the standards of consent.
Of course, some may prefer the paternalism of old.
But we should be able to make that choice, letting doctors know if we would prefer to be well informed or minimally informed.
Likewise, if we want more information, we should ask more questions.
We can ask for additional details about the procedure and other options.
We can ask for the doctor’s own complication rates.
If we are dissatisfied with an answer, we can seek a second opinion.
We can ask the doctor what she would do in our position, or what advice she would give if the patient was her own child or parent.
And, if we still are not sure, we can request more time to consider our options.
Obtaining consent is a vital but often overlooked skill for doctors.
Understanding why so many doctors struggle with it is the first step toward raising the standards of consent.
New Battlegrounds in Development Finance
PRETORIA – The popularity of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to support infrastructure development in emerging countries is growing worldwide.
The G-20 backs PPPs to boost global growth and create jobs.
The BRICS economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) see them as a way to build essential infrastructure quickly and cheaply.
The United Nations hopes that infrastructure PPPs will provide the means to realize its post-2015 global development agenda.
PPPs’ new appeal may redefine not just development economics, but also the overall relationship between rich and poor countries – though not necessarily for the better.
The PPP bandwagon has three essential components: an explosion in infrastructure finance (backed by pension and other large funds); the creation of “pipelines” of lucrative mega-PPP projects to exploit countries’ raw materials; and the dismantling of environmental and social safeguards.
Each must be carefully monitored as the use of PPPs expands.
The World Bank is already seeking to double its lending within a decade by expanding infrastructure projects.
Its new Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) will mobilize global pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure as a specific asset class.
The emerging world has also been active.
The BRICS recently announced plans for a New Development Bank (NDB) for infrastructure and sustainable development.
Its first Regional Center for Africa will be based in South Africa.
China will launch a new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
Both banks aim to offer alternatives to the US-led World Bank and the Japan-led Asian Development Bank, respectively.
Indeed, these new development-finance institutions are seen as a reaction against the Bretton Woods institutions, whose pursuit of neoliberal austerity policies and failure to reform their governance structures to share power with emerging economies, has been blamed for strangling public spending, de-industrialization, and the dismantling of national development banks.
Many emerging countries also resent the World Bank’s environmental and social safeguards, which they see as compromising their national sovereignty.
In response to this criticism, the Bank is revising its safeguards and enforcement mechanisms.
But weaker oversight by the World Bank would leave loan recipients to monitor and enforce environmental and social standards themselves – regardless of their resources or political will to do so –thus jeopardizing efforts to defend the rights of indigenous peoples, resettle displaced people, mitigate environmental damage, or protect forests and biodiversity.
The weakening of World Bank safeguards might also trigger a “race to the bottom,” pitting private or state investors, new financing institutions, and a deregulated World Bank against one another, while provoking a popular backlash.
That is why it is important to have citizens’ groups that can step in to ensure that investments operate fairly.
Though civil-society groups have long monitored the “supply side” – the project financing – they often ignore the “demand side” – namely, the value and impacts of the projects being implemented.
This is especially the case for infrastructure investments in energy, water, transport, and information and communications technology (ICT).
The Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, for example, has planned $360 billion worth of “bankable mega-projects” in these sectors by 2040.
PIDA gives priority to energy (especially hydropower) projects to support mining operations and oil and gas pipelines, while sidelining renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and geothermal.
Similar concerns surround the project “pipelines” of the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America and the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund in Asia.
Though some PPP projects offer high returns, they also demand hefty additional guarantees from the host government to offset private-sector risk.
In this way, fundamental tensions are created both in the way these deals are put together and in the overall conduct of North-South and South-South integration.
For example, powerful groups and transnational corporations (such as the World Economic Forum, General Electric, and Rio Tinto) are gaining influence within the G-20, the G-7, and the BRICS, whose members compete among themselves for access to resources and markets.
That competition now features new Infrastructure Project Preparation Facilities (IPPFs) to accelerate and replicate large PPPs with a disturbing reliance on big dams and fossil-fuel infrastructure, such as Nigeria’s gas-supply pipeline to the European Union – a top priority of PIDA that implies slow progress toward a low-carbon future.
Indeed, the struggle for sustainability, especially in Africa, is becoming a new battleground, featuring deployments by the BRICS, the G-20, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Mercosur, and other international groupings and local vested interests.
To understand how this plays out requires a rigorous new development paradigm.
That is a difficult challenge, because civil society organizations with the greatest interest in learning how to cope with the new pressures tend to specialize in specific development areas, such as the Millennium Development Goals, or sectoral issues, rather than having a broader view of how development finance institutions and their big shareholders operate.
A revived World Social Forum might take on the task, by reverting to its original intention of being a counterweight to the WEF.
In Africa, pan-African bodies charged with coordinated oversight and agenda-setting authority should be judged by whether mega-PPPs in infrastructure reinforce a colonial-style extraction and consumption economy, or create a healthy and sustainable economy for generations to come.
New Equities for Infrastructure Investment
SINGAPORE – Infrastructure projects can be among the most productive investments a society can make, with clear links to a country's economic growth.
For private investors, however, the situation is more complicated.
Infrastructure projects can offer reliable – if lower-than-average – returns.
But existing asset classes all too often fail to provide the structure needed for these projects to compete with traditional equity or debt.
At the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Walter Kielholz, Chairman of Swiss Re, and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown advocated for the creation of a new asset class for infrastructure – as we have done previously, as well.
So how, exactly, can the world harness the potential of private money for infrastructure?
The size of the pie is huge, and so are the opportunities for private investors.
The pipeline for infrastructure projects in emerging markets is estimated to have surpassed $1 trillion – $150 billion of which is expected to be raised from private sources.
In mature markets, infrastructure investment is projected to reach $4 trillion by 2017.
Our analysis of investment deals over the past 18 months shows that public-private partnerships increasingly rely on capital markets to source funds, even as banks rein in lending in order to comply with the regulatory provisions set out by the Third Basel Accord.
Liquidity remains limited in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the legacy of which includes a regulatory regime that is not conducive to long-term investment.
Though financing for public infrastructure has returned to 2008 levels, little of it is being funneled into new projects.
Most funds have targeted existing infrastructure – investments that are considered relatively safe, because they entail little or no construction risk and have demonstrated their potential to generate stable cash revenues.
In order to overcome the obstacles to investment, we propose the creation of an asset class that we call “buy-and-hold equity" (BHE).
This asset class would sit between traditional equity and debt, with investors able to hold it for 15 years or longer.
It would offer returns close to those yielded by equity investments, but with some of the risk offset by its long-term nature.
Risk would be further mitigated through the participation of large, influential investors, including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and possibly international financial institutions.
Public contributions, likely backstopped by multilateral lenders, would provide projects with something close to sovereign risk profiles.
Finally, the regulated nature of cash flows would allow for better pre-defined return structures than traditional private or public equity can offer.
The development of BHE would require a new private-sector investment platform, structured to provide bespoke returns for its different participants.
The private sector would bring in infrastructure investment expertise, while sovereign funds and international financial institutions would provide the bulk of the capital and stability.
Naturally, the platform would focus on projects with defined cash flows and contractual terms (which could include associated risk-mitigation strategies) guaranteed for 20-30 years.
Not all infrastructure projects will be appropriate for this new asset class.
Those best suited will be physical assets that are irreplaceable or core to a country's economy.
Assets with competitive advantages, protections against inflation, limited sensitivity to the economic cycle, and clear, long-term cash flows would also qualify.
Ideally, the investment platform would create a sustained project pipeline by establishing a private-sector-funded structure that does not solely rely on governments or international financial institutions to bring ventures to the market.
The platform would act not only as an investment vehicle, but also as a project initiator, mining opportunities around the world and identifying and classifying them according to a systematic approach.
Both greenfield and brownfield developments would be considered.
The platform would provide its own capital, as well as any technical, operational, and managerial expertise required to classify projects according to risk, thereby enabling the creation of indices that investors could monitor and study.
For projects judged to be secure, the platform could act as a catalyst for long-term investments typical of institutional investors and pension funds.
Designed properly, a new BHE asset class for private and public infrastructure could unleash the power of the market in the interest of the public good.
Given fiscal and other constraints on governments' capacity, it is an asset well worth having.
Infrastructure for a Sustainable Future
WASHINGTON, DC – Infrastructure is a powerful driver of economic growth and inclusive development, capable of boosting aggregate demand today and laying the foundations for future growth.
It is also a key element of the climate-change agenda.
Done badly, infrastructure is a major part of the problem; done right, it is a major part of the solution.
Over the next 15 years, more than $90 trillion in infrastructure investment will be needed worldwide.
That is more than twice the value of the entire stock of infrastructure today, and requires total annual investment to increase more than twofold, from $2.5-3 trillion to above $6 trillion.
Around 75% of this investment will have to take place in the developing world, particularly middle-income countries, owing to their growth needs, rapid urbanization, and already-large infrastructure backlogs.
Closing the infrastructure gap will undoubtedly be challenging.
But it also represents a profound opportunity to create the underpinnings of a more sustainable future.
As it stands, more than 80% of the world’s primary energy supply and more than two-thirds of its electricity are derived from fossil fuels.
Infrastructure alone accounts for around 60% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.
If the world follows the same old approaches in building new infrastructure, it would lock in polluting, resource-intensive, and unsustainable pathways to growth.
But shifting to renewable energies and sustainable infrastructure can have the opposite impact, helping to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions while enhancing countries’ resilience to climate change.
If climate risks are factored into investment decisions, renewable energies, cleaner transport, efficient water systems, and smarter, more resilient cities will emerge as the best bets.
Fortunately, the political will to take action to mitigate climate change has never been stronger.
At last December’s United Nations climate conference in Paris, world leaders reached a landmark agreement to work toward a more sustainable future, including by transforming the way infrastructure projects are developed, financed, and implemented.
But agenda setting is just the first step.
Delivering sustainable infrastructure at scale will require strong public policy leadership and responsive private-sector entrepreneurship.
Policymakers must clearly articulate overall strategies for sustainable infrastructure investment, and embed them in comprehensive frameworks for sustainable growth and development.
Here, the G20 countries can lead the way.
Only with such integrated strategies can policymakers offer the level of policy coherence needed not just to maximize the effectiveness of each policy, but also to instill confidence in the private sector to do its part.
What precisely should those strategies entail?
While specific policy actions and priorities must be tailored to individual countries’ circumstances, the main elements of sustainable infrastructure agendas can broadly be captured under four “I”s: investment, incentives, institutions, and innovation.
For starters, policymakers will need to ensure a significant increase in total investment.
This requires a reversal of the broadly negative public-investment trend in the last couple of decades.
Governments must allocate significantly more funds to sustainable infrastructure.
But, given severe fiscal constraints in many countries, public investment alone is not enough; the private sector will still have to meet more than half of the total need.
Efforts to reduce policy risks and costs of doing business can help spur the private sector to scale up investment considerably.
To ensure that new investment is oriented toward sustainable infrastructure, policymakers must also adjust market incentives.
The elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and the implementation of carbon pricing are particularly important; with oil prices very low, now is the ideal time for countries to implement such reforms.
Pricing reform will also be needed in other industries, including water.
By getting prices right and reforming regulation to correct distorted incentives, governments can put markets to work in support of public-policy goals.
But more investment alone is not enough.
Strong institutions are needed to ensure the feasibility, quality, and impact of that investment.
Particularly important is the capacity to develop strong project pipelines and institutional frameworks for public-private partnerships.
With around 70% of total investment in sustainable infrastructure occurring in urban areas, close attention must also be paid to the quality of municipal institutions, as well as cities’ fiscal capacities.
For developing economies, multilateral development banks will be a key partner in building capacity and catalyzing financing.
Finally, there is the fourth “I”: innovation.
On one hand, technological innovation will be needed to provide increasingly efficient components of low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure.
That is why investment in research and development – especially in renewable-energy technologies – must also increase significantly.
On the other hand, fiscal and financial innovation will be needed to capture the potential of new technologies.
Specifically, the creative use of fiscal space will enable the mobilization of more financing for sustainable infrastructure.
And there will be more space as carbon taxes raise substantial revenue for governments (and improve the tax structure).
Meanwhile, new financial instruments and the resourceful use of development capital can leverage more private finance and lower its cost.
Promoting infrastructure as an asset class could help attract more savings toward infrastructure.
As it stands, assets under management by banks and institutional investors worldwide amount to more than $120 trillion, of which infrastructure accounts for only about 5%.
Today, both infrastructure investment and climate action are urgently needed.
With the right approach, we can achieve both goals simultaneously, building a more prosperous and sustainable future.
Inherited Malignancy
HANNOVER , GERMANY – Breast cancer is among the most life-threatening of malignancies, affecting about one in ten women in the Western world.
Taking the family history of 100 healthy women, at least one affected first-degree relative can be found in up to 15 of them.
Indeed, investigations have shown that the risk of developing breast cancer is roughly doubled in females with a family history of breast cancer.
In 1994-1995, the human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified as major culprits.
Dozens of their mutations are associated with an increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Women who have an abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene run a lifetime risk of up to 85% of developing breast cancer, while the increased risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 55% for women with BRCA1 mutations and about 25% for women with BRCA2 mutations.
Most recently, huge studies analyzing effects of single nucleotide variations in genomic DNA, so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), on breast cancer risk of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers have identified so-called modifier SNP that can decrease or increase the individual lifetime risk.
We have also learned that only 20-40% of the breast cancers that cluster in families come from BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations – genetic alterations that are present from birth in every cell of the body and can be transmitted to the offspring.
Increased breast cancer risk is also known to be associated with several inherited syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a condition that is further associated with childhood onset of multiple malignancies including soft tissue sarcomas, leukemias, and brain tumors.
In most cases of familial breast cancer, however, genetic predisposition remains elusive.
Indeed, no further genes have been found whose mutations are associated with high lifetime risks of developing breast cancer.
Recently, new approaches to investigating genes involved in DNA repair, and huge studies of the effect of SNP on breast cancer risk, have identified two classes of breast cancer susceptibility factors.
One class contains mutations in genes involved in DNA repair.
Their frequency is rather rare and certain mutations can be found only in distinct populations, but this class of susceptibility factors is associated with a moderately increased breast cancer risk.
Considering frequency and risk, this class of breast cancer susceptibility factors can be called “rare, intermediate-penetrance mutations”.
The other class involves what are known as “common, low-penetrance variants.”
Their biological consequences are mainly unknown, but statistical analyses have shown that they are associated with a significantly increased relative breast cancer risk which, in contrast to the first class, is rather small.
Several national networks and consortia have already developed models for estimating the breast cancer risk in women with a positive family history.
We have criteria for genetic testing of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 and guidelines for risk-adapted surveillance programs – including, where appropriate, risk-reducing surgery.
But nothing is known yet about the clinical utility of the recently identified susceptibility factors, whether they are class one or class two.
While these novel susceptibility factors have been shown to be significantly associated with an increased relative breast cancer risk, the statistical significance does not imply clinical utility for preventive management and therapy of breast cancer – at least not yet.
Today, no guidelines are available to make a reasoned clinical decision on the presence or absence of these novel susceptibility factors.
In these circumstances, testing them would only provoke massive insecurity, leading to unnecessary interventions in carriers and a false sense of security in non-carriers, as well as in their relatives.
Today, it is widely accepted that breast cancer, whether familial or sporadic, can be understood as a complex disease.
Thus, the genetically determined portion of an individual’s breast cancer risk is the result of several or even many genetic variants and mutations.
To take full advantage of the known genetic susceptibility factors, it will be necessary to understand their biological consequences.
In addition, reliable risk prediction models are required to learn more about the combined effect of certain patterns of susceptibility factors on overall lifetime risk and response to therapy, including their role as objects of targeted therapies.
Last, but not least, criteria have to be established to define when and to whom genetic testing should be offered.
Thus, “to test or not to test” is not the first question that needs to be answered.
Initially, experts have to ask whether the result of a genetic test for susceptibility factors can help clinical decisions to be made on the basis of generally accepted guidelines.
If, at this time, the answer is no, counselees do not need to waste time and money dealing with the test.
In contrast, if the answer is yes, the informed counselees themselves have to decide if they wish to be tested or not.
Screening the genome for breast cancer susceptibility factors has led to the identification of novel genetic variants, and ongoing studies and further technical progress will certainly lead to additional significant findings.
The challenge today is to extract the clinical relevance of these findings and translate them into daily health care.
Managing this challenge is crucial if we are to realize the promise of individualized medicine, with intensified surveillance and therapy for high-risk patients and avoidance of unnecessary or even harmful interventions in those with a relatively low risk.
In Marx’s Shadow Again
A century and a half ago, Karl Marx both gloomily and exuberantly predicted that the modern capitalism he saw evolving would prove incapable of producing an acceptable distribution of income.
Wealth would grow, Marx argued, but would benefit the few, not the many: the forest of upraised arms looking for work would grow thicker and thicker, while the arms themselves would grow thinner and thinner.
This injustice would provoke revolt and revolution, producing a new, better, fairer, more prosperous, and far more egalitarian system.
Ever since, mainstream economists have earned their bread and butter patiently explaining why Marx was wrong.
Yes, the initial disequilibrium shock of the industrial revolution was and is associated with rapidly rising inequality as opportunities are opened to aggressiveness and enterprise, and as the market prices commanded by key scarce skills rise sky-high.
But this was – or was supposed to be – transient.
A technologically stagnant agricultural society is bound to be an extremely unequal one: by force and fraud, the upper class push the peasants’ standards of living down to subsistence and take the surplus as the rent on the land they control.
The high rents paid to noble landlords increase their wealth and power by giving them the resources to keep the peasants down and widen the surplus – for, after all, they cannot make more land.
By contrast, mainstream economists argued, a technologically advancing industrial society was bound to be different.
First, the key resources that command high prices and thus produce wealth are not fixed, like land, but are variable: the skills of craft workers and engineers, the energy and experience of entrepreneurs, and machines and buildings are all things that can be multiplied.
As a result, high prices for scarce resources lead not to zero- or negative-sum political games of transfer but to positive-sum economic games of training more craft workers and engineers, mentoring more entrepreneurs and managers, and investing in more machines and buildings.
Second, democratic politics balances the market.
Government educates and invests, increasing the supply and reducing the premium earned by skilled workers, and lowering the rate of return on physical capital.
It also provides social insurance by taxing the prosperous and redistributing benefits to the less fortunate.
Economist Simon Kuznets proposed the existence of a sharp rise in inequality upon industrialization, followed by a decline to social-democratic levels.
But, over the past generation, confidence in the “Kuznets curve” has faded.
Social-democratic governments have been on the defensive against those who claim that redistributing wealth exacts too high a cost on economic growth, and unable to convince voters to fund yet another massive expansion of higher education.
On the private supply side, higher returns have not called forth more investment in people.
America’s college-to-high-school wage premium may now be 100%, yet this generation of white, native-born American males may well wind up getting no more education than their immediate predecessors.
And increasing rewards for those at the increasingly sharp peak of the income distribution have not called forth enough enterprising market competition to erode that peak.
The consequence has been a loss of morale among those of us who trusted market forces and social-democratic governments to prove Marx wrong about income distribution in the long run – and a search for new and different tools of economic management.
Increasingly, pillars of the establishment are sounding like shrill critics.
Consider Martin Wolf, a columnist at The Financial Times .
Wolf recently excoriated the world’s big banks as an industry with an extraordinary “talent for privatising gains and socialising losses... [and] get[ting]... self-righteously angry when public officials... fail to come at once to their rescue when they get into (well-deserved) trouble.... [T]he conflicts of interest created by large financial institutions are far harder to manage than in any other industry.”
Wolf then announced his “fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important – the political legitimacy of the market economy itself...”
For Wolf, the solution is to require that such bankers receive their pay in installments over the decade after which they have done their work.
That way, shareholders and investors could properly judge whether the advice given and the investments made were in fact sound in the long run rather than just reflecting the enthusiasm of the moment.
But Wolf’s solution is not enough, for the problem is not confined to high finance.
The problem is a broader failure of market competition to give rise to alternative providers and underbid the fortunes demanded for their work by our current generation of mercantile princes.
Innocent Bystanders
SANTIAGO – Take a taxi in São Paulo nowadays and you will experience the maddening traffic and untidy streets of an emerging-country metropolis. But when the time comes to pay for the ride, you may feel like you are in Boston, Luxemburg, or Zurich: the value of the Brazilian real, like the currencies of many emerging-market countries, is high – and could go higher.
Strong currencies make strong countries, a senior United States policymaker used to say.
Many emerging-country exporters, struggling to retain customers in the wobbly US and European markets, feel otherwise.
For decades, developing countries dreamed of a nirvana of sky-high commodity prices and rock-bottom international interest rates.
But perhaps finance ministers in Lima, Bogota, Pretoria, or Jakarta should have been more careful about what they wished for.
The problem? An invasion of short-term capital flows fleeing the slow-growth, low-interest-rate advanced countries.
Meeting in Calgary last month, the Inter-American Development Bank reported that $266 billion entered Latin America’s seven largest economies in 2010, compared to less than $50 billion a year, on average, between 2000 and 2005.
And while only 37% of inflows in 2006 were “hot money” that can leave at a moment’s notice, last year such inflows accounted for 69% of the total.
Emerging countries in Latin America, East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa are innocent bystanders in the tussle between the US and China over currencies and trade imbalances. And the bystanders are absorbing some of the hardest blows.
For a decade now, the world economy has suffered from tremendous global imbalances: massive external surpluses in countries like China, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, and the oil producers, matched by equally large external deficits in the US, the United Kingdom, Spain, and others.
The imbalances were reduced temporarily as the global financial crisis caused private demand to drop in the US, the UK, and elsewhere.
But, starting in 2010, the imbalances returned, and, according to the International Monetary Fund’s recently released World Economic Outlook, they will not shrink between now and 2016.
G-20 communiqués have repeatedly pledged to secure “adjustment” and “rebalancing” in the world economy, but those promises have come to nothing.
Still-troubled financial systems and huge fiscal deficits are keeping the West’s deficit countries (especially the US) from expanding domestic demand.
And an unwillingness to trade away export-led growth is having the same effect on the East’s surplus countries (especially China).
As a result, emerging countries, according to the IMF, have been pressed to carry “a disproportionate burden of demand rebalancing since the crisis.”
Countries running surpluses accumulate massive stocks of foreign assets, and those resources have to be invested somewhere.
Before the crisis, a substantial amount of that money was invested in US, Spanish, or Irish real estate. Today, that market is dead and the money must go elsewhere.
Europe, gripped by a tremendous banking and debt crisis, is not an attractive destination, and loose monetary policy in the US has produced ultra-low bond yields there.
As a result, many emerging countries, with their higher interest rates and promising growth prospects, have become irresistibly attractive to investors.
After recent events in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, Wall Street analysts are waxing somewhat less optimistically about political stability in emerging countries.
And a flat 2011 performance in some Latin American and Asian equity markets – following tremendous runs in 2010 – has taken a bit of sheen off the emerging-market investment fad. But the money keeps coming.
This dollar invasion is making macroeconomic management in emerging countries even more challenging than usual.
If high commodity prices are expected to persist, then some strengthening of currencies is both desirable and inevitable.
But a thin line separates orderly adjustment to changed conditions from market over-reaction. And sensible people in many emerging-country capitals are wondering whether we have crossed that line.
Loss of export competitiveness as a result of excessively strong currencies is not the only problem.
Massive capital inflows caused real-estate and stock-market bubbles in the US and parts of Europe.
Today, some policymakers in Latin America, worried that the same thing could happen to their countries, are casting about for policy tools to prevent it.
As a result, the US Federal Reserve’s policy of so-called “quantitative easing” is going south, where it takes the form of foreign-exchange intervention.
If rich-country central banks can buy long term bonds, then emerging-country central banks can buy dollar-denominated bonds.
Even countries that practice inflation targeting and have otherwise vowed to let their exchange rates float – Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Chile, for example – have done it, and in large quantities.
Expect macroprudential policies to go south, too – and to be redefined in the process.
If buying dollars is not sufficient to stem the appreciation tide, regulators in emerging economies will erect an array of other barriers to keep money out.
None of these policies is without costs.
They are second-best local-policy responses to an ineffective mechanism for international adjustment (or non-adjustment).
A better system to rebalance the world economy is as necessary as it is unlikely.
All we can look forward to is the next G-20 communiqué.
Silicon Valley or Demand Mountain?
BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON – Everyone wants to know how to build the next Silicon Valley: an innovation hub that draws talent and capital, and that creates jobs, companies, and whole new industries.
Developed-country governments scramble to subsidize technology that could be the Next Big Thing.
Emerging-market policymakers hope that incentives like tax breaks and free land will induce innovators to settle and prosper there.
But most of these well-meaning schemes are missing an essential ingredient: demand.
Demand for innovation in specific areas of technology has been the common force behind all high-tech hot spots, as well as the most important inventions.
Technological breakthroughs such as antibiotics and cars responded to a compelling need felt by a huge number of consumers.
Government projects such as the United States’ Apollo program – intended to put a man on the moon – drove demand for more basic technologies (which are simply inventions that no one has asked for yet).
Silicon Valley itself was built on demand.
The US Department of Defense put up tens of billions of dollars in contracts for microelectronics, a commitment that both paid down innovators’ risk and created an infrastructure that would support the growth of start-ups.
All demand is not created equal, though, and it is instructive to examine the differences.
Consumer or market-driven demand – the kind most of us think of when we hear the word – is far less predictable, and therefore much riskier, than state-sponsored demand of the sort that landed a man on the moon.
Companies that depend solely on their products’ commercial appeal are limited in the kinds of innovations that they can safely introduce, because if one of their products fails in the marketplace, they may not survive to build another one.
This is especially true of start-ups and small companies – the very players that everyone hopes will show up in the next-wave of Silicon Valleys.
Fortunately, by sponsoring long-term, targeted initiatives, governments can stimulate more predictable demand.
The Apollo program gave innovators clearly defined goals and a roadmap for getting there: first put animals in orbit, then put people there, then send probes to the moon, then send people there.
Equally important, the government offered rewards for interim progress, not just ultimate success.
Putting a monkey in space may not have been the most exciting achievement, but the government was paying for it, so it happened.
A smart government creates guaranteed demand not only for the solution itself, but for the steps along the way.
Coupling intermediate technical milestones with guaranteed incentives enables companies to focus on problems that might take ten years or more to solve.
It also motivates innovators from a variety of industries to take on complex problems that must be addressed by more than one kind of invention.
The US Defense Department’s microelectronics initiative required not only new materials and circuits, but also new methods of fabrication.
Because of the reward structure, these efforts could be coordinated, rather than pursued in isolation.
Unlike market-driven demand, which too often results in a winner-takes-all dynamic, state-sponsored demand creates an environment in which multiple solutions to technical problems can proliferate and coexist.
The pioneers of microelectronics tried many strategies to supplant vacuum tubes, and they delivered a host of semiconductors and chip designs: germanium, silicon, aluminum, gallium arsenide, PNP, NPN, CMOS, and so on.
Some of these research efforts were never implemented, but many found their way into specialized devices.
The diversity of options allowed widespread adoption, paving the way for the digital revolution.
As with the microelectronics program, government incentives don’t have to line the road all the way to commercial success.
At some point, companies will be ready to sell products, and market demand can take over.
The US Department of Defense was the only customer for integrated circuits in 1962, but by the end of the decade consumers were buying transistor radios and pocket calculators in droves.
Likewise, state-sponsored demand should not take the form of subsidies to specific technologies or companies; the government has no business gambling taxpayer money on particular ventures.
Assuming that risk is the job of venture capitalists and others in finance, not public officials.
But there is little risk in offering a contract for a job well done: there is no payout if the problem remains unsolved.
And those payouts are modest compared to the research and development efforts they stimulate.
A program offering rewards of $1-5 billion in contracts or deployment commitments can generate many times that value in private-sector R&amp;D. Innovators and their investors are willing to bet big on these opportunities, because they know that the eventual reward in revenue from a global customer base will far exceed the initial investment.
That makes state-sponsored demand a very efficient mechanism for generating innovation.
Because of the multiplier effect, small governments and states, and even large cities, can successfully sponsor the kind of demand that fosters a world-class innovation epicenter.
Certain Scandinavian countries, Chinese provinces, and the city-state of Singapore, for example, are ideally positioned to try this approach.
Some years ago, I calculated how many units of product need to be sold to launch a technology.
The number is actually quite modest: If you can move between 100,000 and one million units of a disruptive product, you can establish the technology standards for that category and in time become the global leader of a new industry.
Government sponsorship ensures that a certain number of people will adopt your product.
At the start, it need not be that many.
The economic planners and policymakers who are chasing Silicon Valley’s taillights are learning that they cannot always replicate the entrepreneurial culture and finance mechanisms that flourish there now.
But they have forgotten how it all started: guaranteed demand, which stimulates the most ambitious kind of innovation.
The lesson is a simple one: Don’t try to build another Silicon Valley.
Instead, build a Demand Mountain, and the innovators will come.
Supply Side, Demand Side, or Innovation Side?
NEW YORK – It has become impossible to deny the so-called secular stagnation gripping the world’s most developed economies: Wealth is piling up, but real wages are barely rising and labor force participation has been on a downward trend.
Worse yet, policymakers have no plausible idea about what can be done about it.
Behind this stagnation is the slowdown in productivity growth since 1970.
The wellspring of such productivity gains – indigenous innovation – has been badly clogged since the late 1960s (mostly in established industries) and was even more so by 2005.
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher viewed the stagnation that was gripping economies by the 1970s from the supply side.
They pushed through tax cuts on profits and wages to boost investment and growth, with debatable results.
But today, with tax rates much lower, cuts of that size would result in huge increases in fiscal deficits.
And with debt levels already high and large deficits ahead, such supply-side measures would be reckless.
So now the best and brightest view things from the demand side, using the theory built by John Maynard Keynes in 1936.
When “aggregate demand” – the level of real expenditure on final domestic goods that households, businesses, the government, and overseas buyers are willing to make – falls short of output at full employment, output is limited to the demand. And innovation won’t happen.
But the demand-siders’ conception of the economy is strange.
For them, private investment demand is autonomous, governed by forces that Keynes dubbed “animal spirits.”
Consumer demand is essentially autonomous, too, because the so-called induced part is yoked to autonomous investment through the “propensity to consume.”
Thus, government measures are the sole way to boost employment and growth when autonomous demand falls short and jobs are lost.
This conception grasps neither growth nor recovery.
In healthy economies, a contractionary demand shock sets off two types of responses fueling recovery.
Adaptations to emerging opportunities are one such response.
When firms hit by reduced demand contract operations, the space they give up becomes available for use by entrepreneurs with better ways of running the business – or with better businesses.
Some of the employees they let go will start firms (and hire employees) of their own.
With every recession, many shops on Main Street disappear; and, over time, new shops – generally more successful – appear.
The other response is indigenous innovation – new ideas springing from the brows of various businesspeople.
When firms hit by reduced demand stop hiring for a time, some people who would have joined established firms use their situation to dream up new products or methods and organize startups to develop them.
The growing number of aspiring innovators toiling in home garages may self-produce some of their capital goods.
More important, the accumulation of new startups will gradually generate rising investment demand – induced demand! – and growth, too.
Some may doubt this. Can new products and methods fare well in the market if demand is deficient?
As an innovator said to me amid the financial crisis, his objective was to take over a market – it mattered little that the targeted market was only 90% of its former size.
Can capital be raised where incomes are depressed?
Small firms and startups must always struggle for credit, and the Great Recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis made it harder for them.
Yet the recession did not prevent droves of such firms from finding financing in Silicon Valley, London, and Berlin. No wonder Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom are more or less recovered.
In the US, total factor productivity growth set records in the 1930s, when the economy fell into and then grew out of the Great Depression.
Recovery has fallen woefully short in two kinds of economies.
France and Italy are lacking young people who want to be new entrepreneurs or innovators, and those few who do are impeded by entrenched corporations and other vested interests.
Greece has no lack of would-be entrepreneurs and innovators, but it lacks a system of angel and venture capital.
Some Greeks have formed startups, though not in Greece.
The demand-siders say that innovation only makes recovery harder, because it enables firms to meet existing demand with fewer employees.
Thus, they call for annual public-sector investment up to the level needed for full employment.
But such infrastructure investment would go far beyond what would ever have been undertaken had the economy been left to regain high employment through the workings of adaptive or innovative activity.
Indeed, such investment is costly beyond the expense because it preempts the adaptation and innovation that would have brought higher employment and faster growth.
Moreover, as long as Western innovation remains narrowly confined, a demand-side commitment to a large, sustained flow of infrastructure investment – and, likewise, a supply-side commitment to a similar flow of private investment – must bring ever-diminishing returns, until, ineluctably, the economy reaches its near-stationary state.
Supplying more of the same old goods never “creates its own demand,” as Keynes thought.
But supplying new goods can.
It is the impediments to adaptation and innovation – not fiscal austerity – causing our stagnation.
And only renewed dynamism – not more fiscal irresponsibility – offers any hope of a durable way out.
Innovation Is Not Enough
CAMBRIDGE – We seem to be living in an accelerated age of revolutionary technological breakthroughs.
Barely a day passes without the announcement of some major new development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, digitization, or automation.
Yet those who are supposed to know where it is all taking us can’t make up their minds.
At one end of the spectrum are the techno-optimists, who believe we are on the cusp of a new era in which the world’s living standards will rise more rapidly than ever.
At the other end are the techno-pessimists, who see disappointing productivity statistics and argue that the new technologies’ economy-wide benefits will remain limited.
Then there are those – the techno-worriers? – who agree with the optimists about the scale and scope of innovation but fret about the adverse implications for employment or equity.
What distinguishes these perspectives from one another is not so much disagreement about the rate of technological innovation.
After all, who can seriously doubt that innovation is progressing rapidly?
The debate is about whether these innovations will remain bottled up in a few tech-intensive sectors that employ the highest-skilled professionals and account for a relatively small share of GDP, or spread to the bulk of the economy.
The consequences of any innovation for productivity, employment, and equity ultimately depend on how quickly it diffuses through labor and product markets.
Technological diffusion can be constrained on both the demand and supply sides of the economy.
Take the demand side first.
In rich economies, consumers spend the bulk of their income on services such as health, education, transportation, housing, and retail goods.
Technological innovation has had comparatively little impact to date in many of these sectors.
Consider some of the figures provided by the McKinsey Global Institute’s recent report Digital America.
The two sectors in the United States that have experienced the most rapid productivity growth since 2005 are the ICT (information and communications technology) and media industries, with a combined GDP share of less than 10%.
By contrast, government services and health care, which together produce more than a quarter of GDP, have had virtually no productivity growth.
Techno-optimists, such as the McKinsey authors, look at such numbers as an opportunity: There remain vast productivity gains to be had from the adoption of new technologies in the lagging sectors.
The pessimists, on the other hand, think that such gaps may be a structural, lasting feature of today’s economies.
For example, the economic historian Robert Gordon argues that today’s innovations pale in contrast to past technological revolutions in terms of their likely economy-wide impact.
Electricity, the automobile, airplane, air conditioning, and household appliances altered the way that ordinary people live in fundamental ways.
They made inroads in every sector of the economy.
Perhaps the digital revolution, impressive as it has been, will not reach as far.
On the supply side, the key question is whether the innovating sector has access to the capital and skills it needs to expand rapidly and continuously.
In advanced countries, neither constraint typically binds much.
But when the technology requires high skills – technological change is “skill-biased,” in economists’ terminology – its adoption and diffusion will tend to widen the gap between the earnings of low- and high-skill workers.
Economic growth will be accompanied by rising inequality, as it was in the 1990s.
The supply-side problem faced by developing countries is more debilitating.
The labor force is predominantly low-skilled.
Historically, this has not been a handicap for late industrializers, so long as manufacturing consisted of labor-intensive assembly operations such as garments and automobiles.
Peasants could be transformed into factory workers virtually overnight, implying significant productivity gains for the economy.
Manufacturing was traditionally a rapid escalator to higher income levels.
But once manufacturing operations become robotized and require high skills, the supply-side constraints begin to bite.
Effectively, developing countries lose their comparative advantage vis-à-vis the rich countries.
We see the consequences in the “premature deindustrialization” of the developing world today.
In a world of premature deindustrialization, achieving economy-wide productivity growth becomes that much harder for low-income countries.
It is not clear whether there are effective substitutes for industrialization.
The economist Tyler Cowen has suggested that developing countries may benefit from the trickle-down of innovation from the advanced economies: they can consume a stream of new products at cheap prices.
This is a model of what Cowen calls “cellphones instead of automobile factories.”
But the question remains: What will these countries produce and export – besides primary products – to be able to afford the imported cellphones?
In Latin America, economy-wide productivity has stagnated despite significant innovation in the best-managed firms and vanguard sectors.
The apparent paradox is resolved by noting that rapid productivity growth in the pockets of innovation has been undone by workers moving from the more productive to the less productive parts of the economy – a phenomenon that my co-authors and I have called “growth-reducing structural change.”
This perverse outcome becomes possible when there is severe technological dualism in the economy and the more productive activities do not expand rapidly enough.
Disturbingly, there is evidence that growth-reducing structural change has been happening recently in the United States as well.
Ultimately, it is the economy-wide productivity consequences of technological innovation, not innovation per se, that lifts living standards.
Innovation can co-exist side-by-side with low productivity (conversely, productivity growth is sometimes possible in the absence of innovation, when resources move to the more productive sectors).
Techno-pessimists recognize this; the optimists might not be wrong, but to make their case, they need to focus on how the effects of technology play out in the economy as a whole.
Our Collective Brain
CAMBRIDGE – Imagine a game of survival that pits a troop of capuchin monkeys against you and your work colleagues.
Both teams would be parachuted into a remote African forest, without any equipment: no matches, knives, shoes, fish hooks, clothes, antibiotics, pots, ropes, or weapons.
After one year, the team with the most surviving members would be declared the victor.
Which team would you bet on?
You might assume that the humans, given our superior intelligence, are the team to beat.
But do you or your colleagues know how to make bows and arrows, nets, water containers, and shelters?
Do you know which plants are toxic?
Can you start a fire without matches?
Can you make fish hooks or natural glues?
Do you know how to protect yourself from big cats and snakes at night?
The answer to most, if not all, of these questions is probably “no,” meaning that your team would likely lose to a bunch of monkeys – probably pretty badly.
This raises an obvious question.
If we cannot survive as hunter-gatherers in Africa, the continent where our species evolved, how did humans achieve such immense success relative to other animals and spread to nearly all of the earth’s major ecosystems?
Here’s a key piece of the answer: We are a cultural species.
Our unique psychological capacities allow us to learn from one another over generations, facilitating a cumulative cultural evolutionary process that produces increasingly complex and sophisticated technologies, languages, bodies of knowledge, conceptual toolkits, and adaptive heuristics.
The power of this process arises not from raw individual intelligence, but from the reinterpretation of the serendipitous insights and mistakes that our intelligence produces.
This means that the rate of innovation will depend, at least in part, on the size and interconnectedness of the pool of minds contributing to the cultural evolutionary process.
All other things being equal, larger and more socially interconnected groups will produce a greater number of fancier tools, technologies, and techniques, even if their individual members are less inventive than those comprising a smaller, more isolated group.
This finding is supported by both tightly controlled laboratory experiments and historical case studies.
About 10,000 years ago, for example, rising oceans transformed Tasmania from an Australian peninsula into an island.
On the mainland, technological progress continued unimpeded.
But in Tasmania, groups of hunter-gatherers began to lose – or failed to develop – a wide range of useful technologies: bone tools, fitted cold-weather clothing, boomerangs, spear-throwers, and durable boats.
When the Dutch arrived in the seventeenth century, Tasmanians had the simplest technology ever encountered by European explorers.
To understand humans’ social nature, it is crucial to understand how culture has driven our genetic evolution in ways that shape not only our physiology and anatomy, but also our social psychology, motivations, inclinations, and perceptions.
From this long process, in which surviving and thriving meant acquiring and adhering to the local social rules, we emerged as potent social learners.
The foundation of our ability to form cooperative communities, organizations, and societies arises not from innate cooperative tendencies, but from the specifics of the social norms that we learn, internalize, and enforce on others.
While our innate motivations do play a role, they are harnessed, extended, and suppressed by social norms, which form the institutional skeleton that allows our innate inclinations to operate.
This novel view of human nature and society generates some important insights.
First, as a cultural species, humans acquire ideas, beliefs, values, and social norms from others in their communities, using cues of prestige, success, sex, dialect, and ethnicity.
We pay particular attention – especially under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, and stress – to domains involving food, danger, and norm violations.
Changing people’s behavior begins with an understanding of our cultural nature, not our rationality.
Second, we gradually internalize the social norms that we acquire through a culture-driven process of self-domestication.
(We acquire our standards for judging and punishing others through the same process.)
These internalized norms become the motivations that guide our actions.
This means that people’s preferences, desires, and motivations are not fixed, and thus that well-designed programs or policies can change what is automatic, intuitive, and obvious.
Third, the most potent social norms harness aspects of our evolved psychology.
Social norms for fairness toward foreigners, for example, are much harder to sustain and diffuse than those that demand that mothers care for their children.
Fourth, our ability to innovate depends on the size of our collective brain, which depends on the ability of social norms to encourage people to generate, share, and recombine novel ideas and practices.
Fifth, there is a fundamental link between institutions and psychology.
Because different societies have different norms, institutions, languages, and technologies, they also have different ways of reasoning, mental heuristics, motivations, and emotional reactions.
The imposition of imported institutions often creates psychological and social mismatches that tend to lead to poor outcomes.
Finally, humans lack a certain degree of rationality, making us terrible at designing effective institutions and organizations – at least for now.
I am hopeful that as we obtain deeper insights into human nature and cultural evolution, this can be improved.
Until then, we should take a page from cultural evolution’s playbook and design systems that use variation and selection to make institutions compete.
That way, we can dump the losers and keep the winners.
By examining the rich interaction and co-evolution of psychology, culture, biology, history, and genetics, we have the possibility to gain important insights into human psychology.
This scientific road has rarely been traveled.
It promises an exciting journey into unexplored intellectual territory, as we seek to understand the peculiarity of our species.
In Praise of Euroskepticism
BRUSSELS &#45;&#45; The EU has no coherent strategy on many issues.
It has only sketchy economic policies toward Russia; ambitions, but no game plan, to become a player in the Middle East; and, despite its original leadership on the Kyoto Protocol, no successor program on climate change.
And the biggest question of all – how to engage with China, India, and other giants of the future – has received virtually no attention from EU-level policymakers.
These issues require attention now, and an integral part of the EU’s search for new global strategies should be to invite, rather than avoid, criticism of its activities.
If the EU is to lift its gaze from its navel to the horizon, it must reconcile the very different views that exist across Europe of its place in the world and its own best interests.
That means engaging with those shades of political opinion that the European Commission and the European Parliament consider “Euroskeptical.”
The counter-pressure, of course, is that EU officialdom feels unloved and unappreciated.
There is an almost embattled culture among many senior officials, who fear that fanning the flames of dissent among Europe’s voters could one day knock European unity off course.
Euroskepticism represents everything the Eurocrats dislike.
They worry that politicians and journalists who oppose their strategies for closer political and economic union could yet tip the balance of public opinion against the EU.
Euroskeptic politicians elected to the European Parliament are often treated with the disdain that true believers reserve for the infidel.
Yet it is ludicrous to think that Euroskeptics represent a silent majority that could rise up and destroy the EU. Popular support for the European project has barely faltered over the last 25 years, and has even begun to strengthen of late.
At the beginning of the 1980’s, when Europe was faltering and the media catchword was “Eurosclerosis,” 50% of people polled for the Eurobarometer surveys viewed membership as positive for their country. About 19% said its effects were negative, and the rest didn’t know.
Today, overall support for the EU stands at 57%, and the share of people unhappy with it has dropped to 15%.
There are now no EU countries where Euroskeptics are in the majority, and the widespread impression that citizens in Western and Eastern Europe alike are turning their backs on the EU is wrong. The reality is that even though voters may find the EU remote, most appreciate the need for Europe to unite in a world where China, India, and other fast-developing countries are set to challenge it.
Reassured by this groundswell of support, the Eurocrats should be fostering a much more pluralistic approach to EU policymaking and debate.
The Commission should be organizing public debates that give equal prominence to dissenting views.
Eurocrats must learn that Euroskepticism is fundamentally healthy, because it invites closer examination of the policy options open to Europe, and thus increases the involvement of ordinary people in the EU’s policymaking process.
And greater involvement quickly leads to better understanding of the issues at stake, and the reasons why some policies have been adopted that challenge or even override the sovereign powers of individual countries.
For half a century, Europe’s integrationists have sought unquestioning acceptance of their efforts.
That demand must be abandoned.
It will probably take several generations before a workable EU-wide political system emerges, but the first step is for the EU to encourage people to have their say, however uncomfortable that may be.
Why Europe?
PRINCETON – What is the point of Europe?
The threat of an explosive disintegration of the eurozone – and with it of the European Union – is receding.
But the confused outcome of Italy’s recent parliamentary election, with an upper house dominated by a party that campaigned on an anti-EU platform and a pro-European majority in the Chamber of Deputies, has revived the fundamental debate about the purpose of European integration.
Europeans find it hard to find a positive way of describing the exercise in which they have been engaged for the past six decades.
One common interpretation is that integration makes people better off.
Unity is supposed to be a foundation of prosperity.
The Common Market was defended at the outset in terms of the gains that would follow from increased trade.
The case for capital-market integration, and then for a single currency, was similar.
All of this recalls some powerful arguments that were made in the nineteenth century about national integration and unification.
In particular, the two countries whose problems drove much of the need for twentieth-century European integration – Germany and Italy – were culturally and politically highly diverse.
In both countries, early-nineteenth-century romantic nationalism gave way to a sober obsession with economic forces after the failed revolutions of 1848.
The influential German journalist Ludwig von Rochau, who coined the term Realpolitik, described the new German mood on the eve of Otto von Bismarck’s last war of unification.
German unity was not a question of the heart’s desire; it was “a mundane business transaction, in which no one should lose, but everyone should grab as much as they could for themselves.”
Italians shared the same belief after the disillusion of 1848.
Patriotism could generate business opportunities.
The great Florentine liberal statesman, Bettino Ricasoli, concluded that Tuscany was simply financially unviable on its own.
This sort of economic nationalism in Germany and Italy briefly produced coalitions of interests that supported the drive to national unification under Bismarck and Cavour.
But the credibility of the national project seemed to crumble when growth faltered, leading to the emergence of movements that championed the aggressive, confrontational, and violent assertion of cultural identity.
Mario Monti is the twenty-first-century descendant of those nineteenth-century patriots who argued for the economic necessity of national unity.
Now it is European unity that is needed for economic reasons.
This vision of Europe is not idealistic; it is simply concerned with how Europeanization can benefit Italians.
And, like its nineteenth-century precursor, it is vulnerable to severe backlashes, especially when it appears to bring only pain and suffering.
Indeed, when today’s Europeans peer into the future, they see only prolonged recession and austerity.
Europe means nothing but sacrifice: northern Europeans paying for southern Europe’s woes through large transfers, or southern Europeans repaying onerous – and maybe impossible – levels of debt.
A variant of the economic argument for European unity is the claim that enhanced integration makes it easier to finance debt, because interest rates are lower.
A reduction in borrowing costs constituted a powerful motive in the 1990’s for southern European governments to join the monetary union.
But the costs of moving into a non-defaulting environment are high.
Here, another historical parallel is helpful.
France in the ancien régime repeatedly imposed semi-default on its creditors by reducing interest rates and extending maturities.
In the 1780’s, a new consensus against such measures emerged.
But the impossibility of raising revenue then triggered the French Revolution, with the revolutionaries demanding confiscatory taxes and impositions on the wealthy elite.
The alternative to thinking about European integration simply as a way of generating wealth and prosperity frequently analogizes it to a marriage.
In the late 1980’s, for example, then-European Commission President Jacques Delors, raising the prospect of a two-speed Europe, suggested that one or two countries might need a “different kind of marriage contract.”
The marriage analogy was used initially to signal that the European relationship was an exclusive one.
Europeans had a unique relationship with which no one –&#160;especially the United States – should interfere.
As Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then France’s finance minister, put it in 1997, “People who are married do not want others in the bedroom.”
But marriage can be a fraught institution (as Strauss-Kahn may know better than most).
The British economic journalist Martin Wolf thinks of Europe as a marriage kept together only by the high cost of divorce.
Others see it as a sham marriage.
Traditional marriage vows entail a commitment that binds the partners through changing circumstances: for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health.
Even if the marriage does not make the partners better off, they still need to stick with it.
So neighbors who have a quarrelsome or violent past are not always well advised to reconcile by marrying.
The problem was that the Europeans did not understand what marriage really meant and why they should want to get married.
Enthralled by promises of material well-being and security, they had exaggerated expectations of romantic wedded bliss.
The unhappy marriage analogy for Europe’s current malaise, while depressing, is helpful.
At least it tells Europeans that they are not stuck together only for material reasons.
But, until that lesson is really learned, Europe must brace itself for more setbacks and backlashes, which means that it must still answer the fundamental question: Why stick it out together, especially at a time when more and more Europeans are choosing not to get married at all?
Insecuritization
BRUSSELS – There is no shortage of analyses of what went wrong in the world’s capital markets over the past 18 months.
What is clear is that a complex set of relationships, interactions, events, and omissions on the part of many different actors, rather than any single factor, was to blame.
I am convinced, for example, that over the years there has been too much “regulatory capture” by the supply side of the financial services market, with its well-organized and powerful lobbies.
By contrast, there has been too little engagement on the demand side.
That is an imbalance of which legislators must be much more conscious.
A second problem for regulators, supervisors, and, indeed, credit rating agencies was scarce resources.
When investment banking markets were booming – and the private sector easily recruited up top talent – regulators and supervisors found it difficult to get the budgets to keep up with innovation and police the markets.
In the future, governments will have to commit the necessary resources to ensure more robust oversight of risk management in financial institutions.
Capital markets must be subject to much more detailed and frequent hands-on supervisory inspections.
In Europe, crisis management mechanisms must be put in place to manage their deeply integrated nature, as 80% of Europe’s banking assets held in cross-border banking groups.
A third problem – particular relevant to banks, risk managers, and traders – has been misaligned incentives.
Incentive structures have been overwhelmingly aligned to short-term performance.
In firms where this was most pronounced, there has been almost total destruction of shareholder value.
As a consequence, a wholly unacceptable long-term burden has been imposed on taxpayers.
Privatizing banks’ profits and socializing their losses is not acceptable in democratic societies.
The structure and timing of performance pay in banks must be more closely aligned to long-term shareholder interests and financial stability.
Incentives for brokers and credit rating agencies have been even more perverse.
In the United States, brokers were selling mortgages without checking whether the borrower had the means to repay.
They had no stake beyond the immediate “sale.”
Financed via Special Purpose Entities, mortgages were parceled up in debt packages and securitized entities in which neither originators nor sponsors retained any material long-term stake but paid credit rating agencies to award a nice little ribbon marked AAA.
When the packages were unwrapped, most of their contents turned out to consist of pools of toxic assets for which there was no proper due diligence, no evidence of capacity to repay, and little cushion to cope with a market downturn.
That’s why I have proposed much tougher measures in the revised Capital Requirements Directive amendments now being considered by the European Parliament.
This will require thorough independent due diligence on securitizations, proper cash-flow sensitivity analysis, and less reliance on credit rating agencies paid by issuers.
Originators or managers of these securitizations will be required to retain a meaningful stake in each tranche of the issue.
I was pilloried for this proposal when I initially put it forward.
I am therefore glad to see that a G-30 advisory group has now supported this principle, and that it is gaining increased traction in the US.
But some banking industry lobbyists have sought amendments in the European Parliament that would totally neuter the proposal’s effectiveness.
Even more irresponsible are attempts to undermine a requirement for adequate due diligence on securitization positions prior to investing – with some amendments containing wording that would make it virtually impossible for supervisors to monitor compliance.
Mortgage assets and leveraged loans created in huckster shops, carved up and buried in “CDO squareds” (securitizations wrapped in other securitizations), and characterized by progressively more obscure, more contingent, and more complex orders of priority for allocating cash flows have no place in capital markets.
The opaqueness, wholly unnecessary complexity, and near impossibility of undertaking independent due diligence on these structures’ underlying risk have undermined trust in the securitization market.
Financial institutions – and their trade bodies – are doing themselves no favors by vigorously opposing meaningful reform.
Is it any wonder that the valuation of securitized investments has become so challenging, that mark-to-market valuation on securitized assets has become meaningless, depressed, or both, and that the securitization market itself has seized up?
Rather than restoring the trust and confidence in capital markets needed for recovery, those European Union members and banking federations that submitted “wrecking amendments” to the due diligence and securitization proposals are reinforcing the suspicion that is now embedded within them.
If successful, they will impair the revival of a transparent, responsible, and vibrant securitization market – a market that, if properly managed, can contribute meaningfully to sustainable, long-term economic growth.
Inside Africa’s Consumer Revolution
JOHANNESBURG – Nowadays, Africa’s economic potential – and the business opportunities that go with it – is widely acknowledged.
Poverty and unemployment are still more widespread than in other emerging markets, but accelerating growth since 2000 has made Africa the world’s second-fastest-growing region (after emerging Asia and equal to the Middle East).
With rapid economic growth have come more prosperous consumers – and vice versa: 45% of Africa’s total GDP growth in the 2000’s (before the financial crisis erupted in 2008) came from consumer-related sectors of the economy.
It is expected that, by 2020, more than half of African households – almost 130 million – will have discretionary income to spend (or save), up from 85 million today.
Moreover, Africa has the world’s fastest-growing population – and the youngest, with more than half under 20 years old, compared to 28% in China.
The United Nations estimates that the continent will account for more than 40% of global population growth through 2030, with the working-age population expected to surpass that of China by 2040.
Given these trends, the continent’s consumer industries are expected to grow a further $410 billion by 2020 – more than half the total revenue increase that all businesses are expected to generate in Africa by the end of the decade.
But, for many companies entering Africa or seeking to expand there from a local base, the challenge now is to obtain a better understanding of the market and its consumers.
In one of the first studies of its kind, the McKinsey Africa Consumer Insights Center surveyed 13,000 individuals from 15 cities in ten of the continent’s 54 countries in 2011 and 2012.
The ten countries – Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, and Tunisia – accounted for 81% of Africa’s private consumption in 2011.
But, throughout the continent, market opportunities for consumer-facing companies are concentrated more in cities than in particular countries.
Indeed, with 40% of its population living in cities, Africa is more urbanized than India (30%), and nearly as urbanized as China (45%).
By 2016, more than 500 million Africans will live in urban centers, and the number of cities with more than one million people is expected to reach 65, up from 52 in 2011 (on par with Europe and higher than India and North America).
This development is critically important for consumer companies.
Urban household spending in Africa is increasing twice as fast as rural spending, with urban per capita incomes, on average, 80% higher than those of countries as a whole.
Befitting the continent’s strong macro trends, the survey found a high degree of optimism among urban African consumers: 84% of respondents expect their households to be better off in two years.
Sub-Saharan Africans are the most optimistic – 97% of Ghanaians, for example, expect to be much better off in two years. (For North Africans, however, that figure drops to only 10-15%, which is unsurprising given the uncertainty generated by the region’s recent political turmoil.)
Overall, consumers are increasing their spending across most retail categories.
Up to 30% of the more optimistic consumers in some countries say that they are shopping more frequently and purchasing new and more expensive products.
And half of all respondents claim to make daily sacrifices to save for major expenditures.
This suggests that companies offering cheap, poor-quality, unbranded products are unlikely to succeed in the long term.
For apparel consumers, for example, quality is second only to price when choosing a store, and second only to fashion when choosing a specific item.
And, in both North and Sub-Saharan Africa, brand loyalty is strong, averaging 58%.
But quality and brand must be delivered at the right price.
Even though Africans value brands and product quality, affordability remains crucial.
To succeed, companies should work to reach consumers’ price points through a combination of product reengineering (such as removing low-value-added features), smaller package sizes, and low-cost operating models.
Moreover, timing is crucial when choosing where to play.
Demand for consumer products typically follows an S-curve.
As incomes rise, categories reach a takeoff point where demand accelerates by 3-5 times.
At higher levels of income, markets become saturated and growth slows.
Different products and categories enter the “hot zone” at different moments: those with low price points, such as snacks and beverages, typically take off relatively early; beauty products somewhat later; and luxury goods, such as branded fashion, later still.
Not surprisingly, in most African markets, few categories have entered the slower-growth “chill-out” zone.
This is where understanding opportunities at a city level is vital.
Country-level planning and resource allocation is still the rule for most businesses operating in Africa, resulting in inefficient allocation of human and capital resources.
By creating detailed profiles of the most promising urban opportunities, companies could target their investments more effectively.
Identifying growth hot spots is only the start.
Substantial differences among and within Africa’s countries imply the need for a much deeper and finer-grained understanding of consumer preferences and affordability profiles by product category.
Likewise, many markets are still in early stages of development, and must be built through concerted consumer education and trial.
Here, Africa’s youth merit special attention: the survey found that the 16-34 age group already accounts for 53% of income in urban centers.
Young people’s consumption habits are quite different from their elders’.
They are more than twice as likely to search for information online and to seek products and stores that reflect the “right image.”
They are also more educated, with 40% of 16-24 year olds having completed high school, compared with only 27% of the 45-and-older group.
These characteristics point to a major change in African consumption habits as this cohort ages, its incomes increase, and its behaviors and decision criteria become the societal norm.
Many companies – particularly multinational firms accustomed to old and aging populations in the advanced countries – will have to adapt accordingly.
Inside Iran’s Nuclear Reasoning
MELBOURNE – Is Iran really hell-bent on becoming a nuclear-armed state?
Or will it settle for nuclear capability, able to make weapons but choosing not to?
Does the difference matter?
Few international questions involve higher stakes than these.
An immediate concern, if deep pessimism about Iran’s intentions prevails, is a preventive Israeli strike, leading to another major Middle East war – with catastrophic consequences for the global economy likely.
No one should underestimate the difficulty of assessing Iran’s real intentions.
Mixed signals from competing power centers don’t help; nor does the recurring contrast between Iranian officials’ usually-strident public pronouncements and often-moderate private discourse.
Pessimists and skeptics have plenty to point to in Iran’s long record of obstruction and brinkmanship in addressing legitimate international concerns about its nuclear programs.
That said, too many policymakers and commentators have rushed to judgment, insisting that Iran is irrevocably determined to build nuclear weapons, or that it wants a break-out capability that is just as dangerous.
In fact, there is good reason to believe that the situation is less alarming and more containable than this.
While a negotiated settlement acceptable to both Iran and the rest of the international community would be a hugely difficult undertaking, it is achievable.
One does not need to look hard for Iran’s reasons for testing the limits of international tolerance: to redeem the humiliations of the Mosaddeq era and beyond; to demonstrate superior technological prowess to the region and the wider world; and to make clear to the Western powers – whose perceived double standards abandoned Iran to Saddam Hussein’s chemical warfare in the late 1980’s – that it would not compromise on its “right” to enrich uranium under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
By contrast, it has not been so easy for observers to see why Iran would stop short of building the nuclear weapons that it may soon have the capacity to produce.
But in my many off-the-record discussions with senior officials in Iran and elsewhere over the last few years, I have heard five such reasons stated with clarity and consistency, and they deserve to be taken seriously.
The first reason is concern that Israel will perceive the existence of one or two Iranian bombs as an existential threat, demanding a pre-emptive military attack – with or without US support, but in either case with resources that Iran knows it cannot match.
Iranians think such an attack unlikely if they do not cross the red line of actual weaponization.
Second, it is well understood that there is zero tolerance in Russia and China for an Iranian bomb, and all the rope that that these powers have so far given Iran in the Security Council will run out if Iran weaponizes.
The writing on this wall became even clearer after the most recent round of sanctions negotiations.
Third, following from this, there is a clear perception in Iran that acquiring an actual bomb would lead to impossibly stringent economic sanctions.
Financial sanctions, direct and indirect, already are biting – including on  the Revolutionary Guard and its significant economic interests – but have been tolerable in the context of asserting Iran’s “right to enrich” under the NPT.
Once in obvious breach of the NPT, universal participation in a much tougher sanctions regime is seen in Iran as inevitable.
Fourth, Iranians acknowledge that any regional hegemony bought with nuclear weapons is likely to be short-lived.
There is skepticism about the capacity of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey to move quickly to build bombs of their own, and a belief that they would be under much international pressure, especially from the US, not to do so.
But there is also a clear view that Arab-Persian, Sunni-Shia, or more straightforward regional power anxieties would make a nuclear-arms race inevitable.
Finally, there is a religious reason: weapons of mass destruction simply violate the precepts of Islam.
Few in the West are likely to find this line very compelling, but it has echoed strongly in every conversation that I have ever had with Iranian officials, senior or minor.
And it is not without plausibility: Iran did not, after all, respond in kind when it was bombarded with chemical weapons by Iraq.
None of this suggests that Iranian intentions can be taken on trust.
There is too much history, and there are too many continuing grounds for suspicion, for that.
Any agreement involving an end to sanctions and diplomatic isolation would need to be accompanied by intrusive monitoring, inspection, and verification arrangements, covering not only all sensitive stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, but also any suspected weapons design or engineering facilities.
The international community requires real confidence that there would be enough lead time – 12 months or so – in which to respond to any evidence of real intent to move to weaponization.
Frustrations will continue, like those over the last year as creative efforts by Security Council members – and more recently by Brazil and Turkey – to find interim confidence-building solutions were rebuffed, largely because the leaders of last year’s democratic movement refused to support a compromise-inclined President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
But there is a solid foundation of rationality on which to build in keeping the door open for negotiations.
Iran is an extraordinarily complex country.
But, just as we cannot afford to underestimate the forces of extremism that persist there, we also fail at our peril to comprehend the currents of restraint and good sense that run within the country, including at high policymaking levels.
America’s Healthy Path to Fiscal Health
BERKELEY – Over the last five years, the growth of health-care spending in the United States has slowed dramatically – to the lowest rate in the past 50 years.
The slowdown is not a surprise.
It is a predictable result of the recession and slow recovery that have left millions of Americans without health insurance and dampened household spending.
But the size of the slowdown is surprising, as is the fact that it started several years before the 2008 recession – and not only in the private insurance system, but also in Medicare and Medicaid, the two major government health programs.
(Medicare provides health coverage for retirees, and Medicaid provides coverage for low-income Americans and their children and those with disabilities.)
What explains this slowdown in health-care spending?
How much of it is attributable to the weak economy, and how much is the result of changes in provider and consumer behavior?
Two recent studies offer different answers, but both predict that at least some of the slowdown will persist even after the economy recovers.
That would be good news for the US economy, which currently devotes nearly 18% of GDP to health care, by far the largest share among developed countries.
It would also be good news for America’s fiscal position, because Medicare and Medicaid are the two largest contributors to the long-term federal budget deficit.
The growth of health-care spending declined or remained unchanged in real (inflation-adjusted) terms each year between 2002 and 2011, falling to 3-3.1% in 2009-2011, the lowest rates on record since reporting began in 1960.
Recent data indicate that after a slight acceleration in 2012, the growth of real health-care spending in 2013 has fallen back to its 2009-2011 average.
As a result of the recession and lagging recovery, health-care spending has also slowed significantly since 2009 throughout the OECD.
Indeed, for the first time on record, real health-care spending stalled on average in the OECD in 2010, as developed countries, reeling from budgetary constraints, clamped down on health programs.
Growth in health-care spending was slower in every OECD country in that year, with the exception of Germany.
A new study by Drew Altman, a respected health-care expert and President of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, concludes that slower growth in real GDP, along with a lower inflation rate, accounts for more than three-quarters of the slowdown in health-care spending in the US after 2001.
The weak economy has caused people to postpone consumption of health-care services and has encouraged states and employers to restrain their spending on health.
But important cost-containing changes in the private health-care system, including more cost-sharing in private insurance plans and tighter controls in managed care, have also contributed to the slowdown.
Altman conjectures that, overall, the growth in health-care spending between 2008 and 2012 was about one percentage point lower than predicted by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions alone.
If this reduction continues after the economy recovers – as seems likely, given the cost-containment incentives in the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) – the US stands to spend $2 trillion less on health care over the coming decade.
Based on the relationship between changes in real per capita health-care spending and changes in unemployment rates at the state level, the recent Economic Report of the President concludes that the recession and lackluster recovery account for less than 20% of the slowdown in health-care spending since 2007 – and for an even smaller share of the slowdown that began in 2002.
And difficult macroeconomic conditions explain little (if any) of the slowdown in Medicare spending per enrollee since 2001.
That is not unexpected, because the largely retired Medicare population is less vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations than is the working-age population.
The Council of Economic Advisers, whose members write the president’s report, surmise that structural changes – including stronger incentives for efficiency by hospitals and providers, more cost-sharing in insurance policies, and the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs – explain most of the deceleration in per capita spending growth.
They also suggest that payment reforms contributed to the slowdown in Medicare’s spending growth after 2001, and that early responses to new Medicare regulations in the Affordable Care Act may have caused a further decline after 2010.
The long-term effect on the federal budget implied by a sustained reduction in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending to the rates of the last several years would be profound.
These programs currently claim 21% of the budget, with Medicare accounting for two-thirds of that amount.
Even a small reduction in the growth of these programs would save billions of dollars.
Based on the unexpected slowdown in spending growth during the last few years, the Congressional Budget Office recently cut its ten-year projections for these programs by 3.5%, reducing the ten-year deficit by $382 billion.
In 2011, Medicare spending accounted for 3.7% of GDP.
Based on current policies, the government forecasts that Medicare spending per beneficiary will grow at an average annual rate of 4.3% and will rise to 6.7% of GDP over the next 75 years.
If, instead, Medicare spending per beneficiary grew by only 3.6% a year, the average rate of the last five years, Medicare’s share of GDP would remain unchanged.
This would narrow the fiscal gap, a widely used measure of long-term budgetary imbalance, by almost one-third.
Trends in the US budget reflect an inconvenient truth: If the growth of spending on health-care programs cannot be slowed, stabilizing the federal debt at a sustainable level will require deep cuts in spending on other priorities and increases in taxes on the middle class.
The recent slowdown in the growth of health-care spending is a promising sign that America’s budgetary tradeoffs may turn out to be less difficult than expected.
Why Turkey is Thriving
NEW YORK – A recent visit to Turkey reminded me of its enormous economic successes during the last decade.
The economy has grown rapidly, inequality is declining, and innovation is on the rise.
Turkey’s achievements are all the more remarkable when one considers its neighborhood.
Its neighbors to the west, Cyprus and Greece, are at the epicenter of the eurozone crisis.
To the southeast is war-torn Syria, which has already disgorged almost 400,000 refugees into Turkey.
To the east lie Iraq and Iran.
And to the northeast lie Armenia and Georgia.
If there is a more complicated neighborhood in the world, it would be difficult to find it.
Yet Turkey has made remarkable strides in the midst of regional upheavals.
After a sharp downturn in 1999-2001, the economy grew by 5% per year on average from 2002 to 2012.
It has remained at peace, despite regional wars.
Its banks avoided the boom-bust cycle of the past decade, having learned from the banking collapse in 2000-2001.
Inequality has been falling.
And the government has won three consecutive general elections, each time with a greater share of the popular vote.
There is nothing flashy about Turkey’s rise, which has been based on fundamentals, rather than bubbles or resource discoveries.
Indeed, Turkey lacks its neighbors’ oil and gas resources, but it compensates for this with the competitiveness of its industry and services.
Tourism alone attracted more than 36 million visitors in 2012, making Turkey one of the world’s top destinations.
Even a short stay in Ankara allows one to see these underlying strengths.
The airport, highways, and other infrastructure are first class, and a high-speed intercity rail network links Ankara with other parts of the country.
Much of the advanced engineering is homegrown.
Turkish construction firms are internationally competitive and increasingly win bids throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Turkey’s universities are rising as well.
Ankara has become a hub of higher education, attracting students from Africa and Asia.
Many top programs are in English, ensuring that Turkey will attract an increasing number of international students.
And the country’s universities are increasingly spinning off high-tech companies in avionics, information technology, and advanced electronics, among other areas.
To its credit, Turkey has begun to invest heavily in sustainable technologies.
The country is rich in wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy, and will most likely become a global exporter of advanced green innovations.
Waste-treatment facilities are not typically tourist attractions, but Ankara’s novel integrated urban waste-management system has rightly attracted global attention.
Until a few years ago, the waste was dumped into a fetid, stinking, noxious landfill.
Now, with cutting-edge technology, the landfill has been turned into a green zone.
The private waste-management company ITC receives thousands of tons of solid municipal waste each day.
The waste is separated into recyclable materials (plastics, metals) and organic waste.
The organic waste is processed in a fermentation plant, producing compost and methane, which is used to produce electricity in a 25-megawatt power plant.
The electricity is returned to the city’s power grid, while the heat exhaust is piped to the facility’s greenhouses, which produce tomatoes, strawberries, and orchids.
Turkey’s diversified, innovative base of industry, construction, and services serves it well in a world in which market opportunities are shifting from the United States and Western Europe to Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
Turkey has been deft in seizing these new opportunities, with exports increasingly headed south and east to the emerging economies, rather than west to high-income markets.
This trend will continue, as Africa and Asia become robust markets for Turkey’s construction firms, information technology, and green innovations.
So, how did Turkey do it?
Most important, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his economics team, led by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan, have stuck to basics and looked to the long term.
Erdoğan came to power in 2003, after years of short-term instability and banking crises.
The International Monetary Fund had been called in for an emergency rescue.
Step by step, the Erdoğan-Babacan strategy was to rebuild the banking sector, get the budget under control, and invest heavily and consistently where it counts: infrastructure, education, health, and technology.
Smart diplomacy has also helped.
Turkey has remained a staunchly moderate voice in a region of extremes. It has kept an open door and balanced diplomacy (to the extent possible) with the major powers in its neighborhood.
This has helped Turkey not only to maintain its own internal balance, but also to win markets and keep friends without the heavy baggage and risks of divisive geopolitics.
No doubt, Turkey’s ability to continue on a rapid growth trajectory remains uncertain.
Any combination of crises – the eurozone, Syria, Iraq, Iran, or world oil prices – could create instability.
Another global financial crisis could disrupt short-term capital inflows.
A dangerous neighborhood means inescapable risks, though Turkey has demonstrated a remarkable capacity during the last decade to surmount them.
Moreover, the challenge of raising educational quality and attainment, especially of girls and women, remains a priority.
Fortunately, the government has clearly acknowledged the education challenge and is pursuing it through school reforms, increased investments, and the introduction of new information technologies in the classroom.
Turkey’s successes have deep roots in governmental capacity and its people’s skills, reflecting decades of investment and centuries of history dating back to Ottoman times.
Other countries cannot simply copy these achievements; but they can still learn the main lesson that is too often forgotten in a world of “stimulus,” bubbles, and short-term thinking.
Long-term growth stems from prudent monetary and fiscal policies, the political will to regulate banks, and a combination of bold public and private investments in infrastructure, skills, and cutting-edge technologies.
Instability from Rigidity
Everyone wants economic stability, and many are reluctant to abandon today what gave them stability yesterday.
But trying to obtain stability from rigidity is illusory.
The stability of the international financial system today depends on the willingness of countries with rigid exchange rates to allow greater flexibility.
In the aftermath of the international financial crisis of 1997-1998, many emerging markets found themselves – through currency depreciation, rapid productivity gains, or both – highly competitive.
Countries that ran significant current-account surpluses, built up large reserves, and fixed (or heavily managed) their exchange rates in order to support the first two objectives appeared to secure external stability.
The irony is that the crisis of 1997-1998 was one in which a particular system of exchange-rate pegs failed when capital flowed out.
Yet, in many ways, accumulating reserves worked better than anyone could have imagined – countries found that they could withstand considerable shocks and growth was impressive both domestically and globally.
So, within a few years, many countries concluded that their pegs could work fine if supported by large enough war chests of official reserves.
A new type of order emerged in the world’s exchange rate system.
There were, of course, some less desirable spillover effects on others.
If a considerable fraction of the world economy wants to run a current-account surplus (by 2006, this included much of emerging Asia, most oil exporters, and Japan), an equal share of the world economy must run a deficit.
In the period after 1998, the United States provided almost the entire required deficit.
As long as US assets were attractive to residents of surplus countries (or there was an acceptable chain of investments from surplus countries that ended in the US), these accumulations of reserves were sustainable.
The IMF worried a great deal about what would happen when this chain broke – and the eventual break was, of course, more a matter of arithmetic than economics.
The US current-account deficit can persist above roughly 3% of GDP only if unrealistic assumptions are made about the share of US assets that the rest of the world is willing to hold.
The policy plans announced by China, the euro area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the US in the spring of 2007 – in the context of the IMF’s Multilateral Consultation on global imbalances – represent the international community’s response to the rising risks.
The US is to reduce its deficit, with the surplus countries proposing sensible steps to bring down their surpluses in ways that support global growth.
The sense of urgency in these discussions has increased in recent months, as the global situation has grown more complex.
Specifically, problems in the US housing sector have, since summer, undermined confidence in securitized assets.
The net result has been to shift global portfolio preferences in ways that have affected some exchange rates significantly.
The dollar has depreciated in a way that helps global adjustment and fortunately does not disrupt the US government securities market; long-term rates are in fact down from July, so adjustment has been “orderly.”
Yet the pattern of exchange-rate movements in the rest of the world has been largely unrelated to existing current-account positions.
In fact, currencies of surplus countries with heavily managed exchange rates have actually depreciated in real effective terms since the summer, creating inflationary pressure and frustrating global adjustment.
This has also shifted the burden of adjustment disproportionately onto countries with floating currencies, such as the euro and the Canadian and Australian dollar.
The lack of adjustment of surplus countries with inflexible exchange rate-regimes means that as the US deficit falls, a counterbalancing deficit develops elsewhere in the world – along with real effective exchange rate appreciation.
Knowing what to do in this increasingly complex and volatile situation is the easy part: look at the Multilateral Consultation policy plans and “just do it.”
As the US Treasury’s recent semiannual report to America’s Congress noted, for China these plans are to “rebalance its economy: boosting domestic demand and consumption-led growth; reforming its financial system; and achieving greater flexibility in its exchange-rate regime.
Indeed, rebalancing the pattern of growth is a central economic goal of China’s leadership.”
But expanding demand and allowing real effective exchange rate appreciation in China will not be enough if other countries do not do their part.
Oil exporters must increase fiscal spending further; Japan and the Euro area must trigger higher growth through structural reforms; and the US must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings.
This would help maintain confidence that the adjustment process will remain orderly and free of new global imbalances or protectionism.
Implementing the policy commitments from the multilateral consultation is also needed to avoid a loss of confidence in the dollar.
The risks to global growth will increase as long as adjustment remains uneven.
The politics is not so simple, but we need cooperation between countries to reduce these risks, and we need it now.
David Cameron’s European Spaghetti Bowl
WASHINGTON, DC – British Prime Minister David Cameron’s “Europe” speech, delivered on January 23, was powerful, polished, contained a bold vision, and offered good arguments.
In particular, he got three things right.
But translating those arguments into institutional reality will be a nearly impossible challenge.
First, Cameron is correct to emphasize the urgent need for a renewal of popular support for the European Union.
The percentage of Europeans who believe that the EU is “a good thing” is dropping steadily.
Democracies require real debate.
Yet too many decisions about the future of Europe and the eurozone are made in highly technocratic settings, with most citizens not really understanding what is going on, let alone feeling that policymakers care.
One can debate whether a referendum is the most appropriate vehicle for asking for their consent, but ask one must.
As Cameron put it: “There is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”
Addressing the political challenge head on is much better than trying to evade the debate.
Second, Cameron was right to say that “the European Union that emerges from the eurozone crisis … will be transformed beyond recognition by the measures needed to save the eurozone.”
He did not disagree that the eurozone needs more integration, but correctly noted that the required degree of political integration is beyond the comfort zone of British citizens and of others in the EU.
Finally, Cameron argues that the EU is not an end in itself.
Rather, it must deliver better economic performance for its citizens by emphasizing the challenge of competitiveness, particularly with respect to the new emerging countries.
His speech stressed the economic weakness of many EU members (though some – such as Germany and the Nordic countries – are actually doing reasonably well in the global marketplace).
As a conservative, Cameron lays the blame for economic weakness on the size of the state and a high degree of market regulation, though some Nordic countries with large government spending and strong financial and environmental regulations are in better shape than the UK, which has had less of both.
But he is right that a debate on economic performance is needed, and that it will be crucial to reform Europe in a way that maximizes its prospects in global competition.
It is normal for conservatives to argue for less government and to place greater trust in free markets, and for social democrats and greens to argue for public policies that deliver less income inequality, more public goods (such as a clean environment and public transport), and more regulation to help markets function with greater stability and distribute benefits more evenly.
The competitiveness debate should indeed be part of the debate about Europe’s renewal.
But Cameron’s vision for Europe’s institutional future is difficult to translate into workable specifics.
He argues for a Europe “à la carte,” at least for those outside the eurozone.
He entertains the possibility that the UK and other EU countries that have opted out of the eurozone could each negotiate a specific and special “deal” with the EU, picking and choosing among its various dimensions those that suit them best and cost them the least.
Thinking about the consequences that such a Europe would have on EU institutions, one must ask how the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of Ministers would function.
Would there be one set of sub-institutions for every country that has made a special deal with the Union – say, a Commission for the eurozone and Sweden, and another for the eurozone and the UK?
And would the European Parliament become fragmented in similar fashion?
Would the European Council have a diverse set of memberships?
How many temporary or permanent opt-outs can there be?
How will Europe’s citizens, who already have enough trouble with the complexities of European governance, be able to comprehend such a “spaghetti bowl” structure?
And yet Cameron is right to believe that not all EU members will want or be able to be part of a more integrated eurozone.
There will have to be some flexibility if the EU is not to shrink, becoming a smaller eurozone.
British membership is important to many in Europe.
One way to overcome the dilemma might be to articulate an institutional future in which there would be essentially just two types of countries within the EU and the single market: those in the eurozone and those with national currencies.
There would have to be two sets of EU institutions, one for the eurozone and another for non-eurozone countries, although they would overlap.
This is already the case in some areas: consider the EU-wide Ecofin and the eurozone-only Eurogroup of Finance Ministers.
Something similar could be created for the European Parliament, and so on.
It would be complex, but it could be made manageable; we should discuss how.
A new European treaty would not allow cherry-picking, but would give each member state a chance to join, or commit to, either the politically more integrated eurozone or the less integrated second group.
There would be clear rules and decision-making mechanisms for both sets of countries, subject to democratic votes by a two-tier European Parliament.
Many details would have to be worked out.
But this may be a vision that gives Europe a chance to remain big and inclusive, while retaining the politically integrated core that the eurozone needs.
Can China Adapt?
SHANGHAI – China’s “Two Sessions” – the annual gatherings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference held every March – have always drawn global attention.
But the meetings this year seemed particularly significant, owing not only to the country’s leadership transition, but also to its economic slowdown amid calls for deeper reform.
How, then, will China’s new leaders respond?
The problem is simple: No one can predict accurately how long the slowdown will last.
The authorities, lacking confidence in their ability to restore pre-2009 rates of annual GDP growth, have lowered the official target to 7.5%.
Many economists are becoming even more pessimistic, pointing to Japan as evidence that, after three decades, China’s breakneck growth may be coming to an end.
Japan’s economy, they point out, achieved more than 20 years of sustained rapid growth; but, in the 40 years since 1973, annual growth has exceeded 5% only a handful of times, and output has stagnated for the last two decades.
But today’s pessimists need to account for some fundamental differences between the two economies.
For example, Japan was already a high-income country in 1973, with per capita income (in terms of purchasing power parity) at roughly 60% of the United States’ level.
The “Four Asian Tigers” (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) experienced a slowdown in GDP growth at a similar relative income level.
By contrast, China’s per capita income is only about 20% of the US level.
In other words, we should not underestimate the Chinese economy’s potential to converge toward developed countries.
The pessimists, however, doubt that China can maintain catch-up economic growth.
They argue that the current growth model, if not the economic system more broadly, is driving the country into a “middle-income trap.”
Attributing problems to systemic causes is a typical habit of thought in China.
But can a system that has sustained 30 years of hyper-growth really be worse than those systems adopted in Japan and the Four Tigers?
China’s economic system, which developed from the institutions of central planning, must have had some merits during this period.
But the development and ultimate structure of economic institutions are closely related to a country’s income level or stage of economic development.
If some aspects of the current system cannot be adapted to support further economic development, they could end up hindering it.
What really matters for economic growth is not whether a system is the “best,” but whether it can be adjusted to serve a new phase of economic development.
From this perspective, it is vital to ensure that an economic system is open to institutional reform.
No economic system, however “optimal,” can sustain long-term growth once it is no longer reformable.
After its extraordinary post-1945 economic miracle, Japan fell into a pattern of ultra-slow growth because it lacked the flexibility to adapt its institutions for a new phase of economic development, characterized by heightened global competition.
By contrast, South Korea has maintained its growth momentum since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990’s.
Western economists often criticize its economic system, but the key point is that its institutions are flexible and open to change, which implies a high degree of economic resilience.
Why is one system amenable to reform, while another is not?
In recent years, research has indicated that vested interests and powerful lobbies distort economic policies and cause governments to miss good opportunities.
A system receptive to reform requires the government to have greater power or wealth than any interest group, thus enabling it to pursue long-term policy goals and ensure the success of reform.
For example, Yao Yang of Peking University has argued that the Chinese government is able to decide the right policies at critical points, because it is not unduly swayed by any interest group.
It is this neutrality, he says, that explains the success of China’s economic transition and its three decades of rapid economic growth.
But what about now?
China is entering a new phase of development, and institutional reform in key areas – particularly the public sector, income distribution, land ownership, the household registration system, and the financial sector – has become imperative.
Obviously, reform is more difficult today than it was when China began its economic transition.
State-owned enterprises, for example, currently account for 40% of total corporate assets, but only 2% of all firms, which implies significant policy influence.
But China seems unlikely to go the way of, say, Russia.
On the contrary, the accumulation of wealth in the Chinese government’s hands should enhance its ability to press ahead with reform.
Institutional flexibility has been the key to China’s economic transition and rapid growth over the last three decades, and it is vitally important that the Chinese government remains neutral and avoids being captured by interest groups.
In short, the authorities must ensure that the system remains open to change in the long run.
Successful implementation of another round of far-reaching reform depends on it.
Emerging Economies’ Misinsurance Problem
LONDON – Over the last decade, America’s expansionary monetary policy and China’s rapid growth have been the two key drivers of global financial flows.
Now, both dynamics are being reversed, generating new risks for the global economy – particularly for emerging countries.
Whether they can cope with these changes will depend on whether they have taken out enough insurance against the right risks.
Following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990’s, emerging economies began to accumulate massive foreign-exchange reserves to protect themselves against the risks of external over-indebtedness.
In fact, they amassed far more than they needed – $6.5 trillion, at last count – effectively becoming over-insured against external balance-of-payments shocks.
But they remained underinsured against domestic credit risks ­–&#160;the leading threat to emerging economies today.
After the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, interest rates plummeted, fueling private-sector credit booms in many of the largest emerging markets, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey.
Although these booms were initially financed by domestic capital, they soon became dependent on foreign capital, which flowed into their economies as advanced-country central banks pumped huge amounts of liquidity into financial markets.
Now, just as the US Federal Reserve contemplates an exit from its unconventional monetary policies, emerging economies’ current-account positions are weakening, making their reliance on capital inflows increasingly apparent – and increasingly dangerous.
Ironically, today’s pain stems from one of the great successes that emerging economies have achieved: the reduction of foreign-currency funding in favor of local-currency debt.
As emerging-market central banks leaned against heavy capital inflows in order to mitigate exchange-rate appreciation, their currencies became less volatile.
The resulting perception that currency risk was declining bolstered capital inflows further.
This virtuous feedback loop has now turned vicious, with capital inflows amounting to only a fraction of outflows.
Given this, the likely upshot of monetary tightening in the advanced economies will be a long depreciation of emerging-market currencies and, in turn, a significant interest-rate hike – a trend that puts emerging economies at risk for the kinds of credit crises that have bedeviled developed economies over the last six years.
The higher interest rates rise to stabilize emerging markets’ currencies, the more severe their crises will be.
Ultimately, even if emerging economies manage to diversify their funding away from foreign currencies, they will remain hostages to US monetary-policy cycles.
Had emerging economies resisted the temptation of excessive private-sector credit growth, raising interest rates in order to stabilize currencies would not pose a severe threat to economic performance.
But, unsurprisingly, they did not; rather, they succumbed to the notion that unprecedentedly high rates of GDP growth were the new normal.
Nowhere was this more apparent than in China, where double-digit annual output gains long obscured the flaws in a state-led, credit-fueled growth model that favors state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and selected industries, like the real-estate sector, to the detriment of private savers.
Since 2008, banking-sector credit growth in China has been among the fastest in the world, far outpacing GDP growth, and China’s total debt has risen from 130% of GDP to 220% of GDP.
As of this year, ¥1 of GDP growth is consistent with more than ¥3.5 of credit growth.
China’s financial sector is now increasingly feeling the strain of this rapid credit growth, which has led to overcapacity in favored sectors and mounting debt problems for local governments, SOEs, and banks.
Meanwhile, China’s shadow-banking system has expanded at an unprecedented rate.
But here, too, mounting risks have been largely ignored, owing partly to the collateralization of real property, which is believed to retain its value permanently, and partly to the system of implicit government guarantees that backs loans to local governments and SOEs.
At the very least, the combination of higher interest rates in the shadow-banking sector and weaker nominal GDP growth undermines borrowers’ debt-repayment capacity.
In a worst-case scenario, falling property prices or diminishing faith in implicit government guarantees would compound the risks generated by the shadow-banking system, severely undermining China’s financial stability.
In that sense, although China, with its $3.5 trillion stock of foreign-exchange reserves, may seem to exemplify emerging economies’ tendency to be over-insured against external risks, it actually faces the same credit risks as its counterparts.
The difference is that China has implemented structural – and thus longer-lasting – credit-based policies, while other emerging economies have been drawn into a cyclical lending binge.
Indeed, China’s slowness to implement an alternative to the investment-led, debt-financed growth model that has prevailed for the last two decades means that its domestic credit risks are the most significant threat to the global economy today.
While China may have the financial resources to cover its debt overhang, it risks being left with a low-to-middle-income economy, high debt levels, and nominal growth rates roughly two-thirds lower than the 17% average annual rate achieved in 2004-2011.
This is bad news for other emerging economies, which have depended heavily on China’s growth for their own.
Unless emerging-market governments take advantage of the limited space provided by their foreign-exchange reserves and floating currencies to enact vital structural reforms, the onus of adjustment will fall on interest rates, compounding the effects of slowing growth and the risks associated with bad debt.
Whether this becomes a systemic issue affecting the entire global economy will hinge on China.
Insuring the Worst
In the nearly six months since Hurricane Katrina destroyed half of New Orleans, many storm victims’ expectations of help have been dashed, creating a legacy of bitterness.
That legacy may be all the more painful when we consider that many homeowners suffered unnecessarily devastating losses because of their lack of insurance or their underinsurance, often owing to the belief that they could not afford the right coverage.
Future catastrophes – storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, forest fires, agricultural or other environmental crises, disease epidemics, or terrorist attacks – are likely to result in the same kinds of problems.
So it is important to consider the causes of underinsurance and whether our insurance institutions are adequate to the risks that we face.
According to a report from the Insurance Information Institute, nearly 70% of homeowners’ claims in Louisiana were settled by the end of January, for a total of $7.5 billion dollars.
Sounds good, but there were roughly 200,000 homes that were either severely damaged or destroyed, so the total amounts to less than $40,000 per home – far below what was needed.
Indeed, a large share of New Orleans homeowners – 60% in Orleans Parish – were completely uninsured against floods.
Many of those who were insured discovered that clauses in their policies barred them from collecting full benefits.
In some cases, insurance companies argued that houses were damaged by flood, not wind, which their policies cover more generously.
That may seem like capricious hair-splitting to people who have suffered a major loss, but such terms are in the insurance contracts that they signed, whether they understood them or not.
Claims disputes have led to many lawsuits, and many of those who have lost their homes have discovered that the only help available to them now is a low-interest loan.
Not unreasonably, President George W. Bush wants government grants to bail out only the approximately 20,000 homeowners who can’t be faulted for failing to buy flood insurance, because they lived outside the designated flood plains.
Despite the disappointments, private insurance is still the best way to deal with possible future disasters.
Insurance policies that clearly specify the amounts that will be paid and the types of damage that will be covered are far better than the government-administered, after-the-fact bailout that many people seem to have expected.
Adequate private insurance can be boosted in the future through public education, improved insurance institutions, and lower insurance costs.
We need to work on all of these agendas, because each must be part of any new plan to deal with the next catastrophe.
The cost of insurance may be the most serious problem.
According to estimates by Robert Klein of Georgia State University, homeowners’ insurance premiums in Louisiana had already gone up by 70% between 1997 and 2005.
State insurance regulators resist rate increases, but they are ultimately powerless, because insurers can simply take their business elsewhere.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) proposed in December that each of America’s 50 states should establish a disaster insurance fund to cover a wide range of big calamities.
The funds – modeled after similar funds in France and Spain – would be designed to cover the biggest, once-in-fifty-years catastrophes.
The federal government would then augment the protection up to the once-in-five-hundred-year level.
The NAIC’S proposal is now under discussion.
If it were fully implemented, which is unlikely, it would constitute a revolution in risk management in the US similar to that of the creation of Social Security in 1934.
But preparation for catastrophe does not have to reside exclusively with the government.
Mega-disaster risks can be handled with private financial markets, as long as these markets manage to get the full attention and interest of portfolio investors.
Consider catastrophe bonds (or “cat bonds”), which contain clauses that stipulate that the issuer of the bond (the borrower) does not have to repay the money if a specified catastrophe occurs.
The bonds can be sold to a worldwide market by insurance companies that incur major risks by writing policies.
If the insurance companies can get a good enough price for such bonds, they can eliminate their exposure to the risk of a major disaster, thereby allowing them to issue policies to homeowners at a lower cost.
Cat bonds have been growing in importance in recent years.
According to estimates by Lane Financial, there were $1.8 billion worth of cat bonds issued in the year April 2004-March 2005.
Since Katrina, issuance has accelerated.
In the first three post-Katrina months alone (September to December 2005), $2.1 billion were issued.
The total value of outstanding cat bonds is small by Katrina standards.
But the trend towards increasing sophistication and breadth of our financial markets suggests that we can expect to see much further growth in cat bonds.
Ultimately, even Hurricane Katrina and other disasters of similar magnitude are small by world standards.
The total insured property loss of Katrina, $34.4 billion according to an insurance industry estimate, even if expanded to represent uninsured losses, represents a miniscule fraction of world wealth.
But such disasters represent a much larger share of a single country’s wealth.
This is why financial theory prescribes spreading risks as evenly as possible around the world, rather than around only one country, as plans for a national catastrophe fund envision.
The possibility of managing national risks globally is another example of the advantages of economic globalization and expansion of financial markets.
Intellectual-Property Rights and Wrongs
Last October, the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) decided to consider what a development-oriented intellectual property regime might look like.
The move was little noticed, but, in some ways, it was as important as the World Trade Organization’s decision that the current round of trade negotiations be devoted to development.
Both decisions acknowledge that the current rules of the international economic game reflect the interests of the advanced industrial countries – especially of their big corporations – more than the interests of the developing world.
Without intellectual property protection, incentives to engage in certain types of creative endeavors would be weakened.
But there are high costs associated with intellectual property.
Ideas are the most important input into research, and if intellectual property slows down the ability to use others’ ideas, then scientific and technological progress will suffer. 
In fact, many of the most important ideas – for example, the mathematics that underlies the modern computer or the theories behind atomic energy or lasers – are not protected by intellectual property.
Academics spend considerable energy freely disseminating their research findings.
I am pleased when someone uses my ideas on asymmetric information – though I do appreciate them giving me some credit.
The growth of the “open source” movement on the Internet shows that not just the most basic ideas, but even products of enormous immediate commercial value can be produced without intellectual property protection.
By contrast, an intellectual property regime rewards innovators by creating a temporary monopoly power, allowing them to charge far higher prices than they could if there were competition.
In the process, ideas are disseminated and used less than they would be otherwise.
The economic rationale for intellectual property is that faster innovation offsets the enormous costs of such inefficiencies.
But it has become increasingly clear that excessively strong or badly formulated intellectual property rights may actually impede innovation – and not just by increasing the price of research.
Monopolists may have much less incentive to innovate than they would if they had to compete.
Modern research has shown that the great economist Joseph Schumpeter was wrong in thinking that competition in innovation leads to a succession of firms.
In fact, a monopolist, once established, may be hard to dislodge, as Microsoft has so amply demonstrated.
Indeed, once established, a monopoly can use its market power to squelch competitors, as Microsoft so amply demonstrated in the case of the Netscape Web browser.
Such abuses of market power discourage innovation.
Moreover, so-called “patent thickets” – the fear that some advance will tread on pre-existing patents, of which the innovator may not even be aware – may also discourage innovation.
After the pioneering work of the Wright brothers and the Curtis brothers, overlapping patent claims thwarted the development of the airplane, until the United States government finally forced a patent pool as World War I loomed.
Today, many in the computer industry worry that such a patent thicket may impede software development.
The creation of any product requires many ideas, and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome – let alone which ones are really new – can be nearly impossible.
Consider a drug based on traditional knowledge, say, of an herb well known for its medicinal properties.
How important is the contribution of the American firm that isolates the active ingredient?
Pharmaceutical companies argue that they should be entitled to a full patent, paying nothing to the developing country from which the traditional knowledge was taken, even though the country preserves the biodiversity without which the drug would never have come to market.
Not surprisingly, developing countries see things differently.
Society has always recognized that other values may trump intellectual property.  The need to prevent excessive monopoly power has led anti-trust authorities to require compulsory licensing (as the US government did with the telephone company AT&T).
When America faced an anthrax threat in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, officials issued a compulsory license for Cipro, the best-known antidote. 
Unfortunately, the trade negotiators who framed the intellectual-property agreement of the Uruguay trade round of the early 1990’s (TRIP’s) were either unaware of all of this, or more likely, uninterested.
I served on the Clinton administration’s Council of Economic Advisors at the time, and it was clear that there was more interest in pleasing the pharmaceutical and entertainment industries than in ensuring an intellectual-property regime that was good for science, let alone for developing countries. 
I suspect that most of those who signed the agreement did not fully understand what they were doing.
If they had, would they have willingly condemned thousands of AIDS sufferers to death because they might no longer be able to get affordable generic drugs?
Had the question been posed in this way to parliaments around the world, I believe that TRIP’s would have been soundly rejected.
Intellectual property is important, but the appropriate intellectual-property regime for a developing country is different from that for an advanced industrial country.
The TRIP’s scheme failed to recognize this.
In fact, intellectual property should never have been included in a trade agreement in the first place, at least partly because its regulation is demonstrably beyond the competency of trade negotiators.
Besides, an international organization already exists to protect intellectual property.
Hopefully, in WIPO’s reconsideration of intellectual property regimes, the voices of the developing world will be heard more clearly than it was in the WTO negotiations; hopefully, WIPO will succeed in outlining what a pro-developing intellectual property regime implies; and hopefully, WTO will listen: the aim of trade liberalization is to boost development, not hinder it.
The International Barriers to Trump’s Economic Plan
DUBAI – US President-elect Donald Trump should have a relatively clear road ahead at home for the implementation of his economic program: with Republicans holding majorities in both houses of Congress, he seems likely to benefit from a break in the political gridlock that has paralyzed the body for the last six years.
But the United States economy does not exist in a vacuum.
If Trump is to succeed in delivering the high growth and genuine financial stability that he has promised, he will need some help from abroad.
Trump has established infrastructure investment, tax reform, and deregulation as central components of his strategy to boost the US economy’s actual and potential growth.
Confident that his plan can unfold as intended, he has set ambitious targets, including GDP growth approaching 4% per year.
For now, investors seem to be pretty much sold.
Under the assumption that the incoming Trump administration will ultimately refrain from triggering a trade war, they moved fast to price in optimistic prospects for higher real growth, higher inflation, and more money entering the financial markets.
This has enabled the US Federal Reserve to begin to normalize its monetary-policy stance; in addition to a 25-basis-point interest-rate hike on December 14, the Fed has indicated that the pace of such hikes will accelerate in 2017.
As a result, markets seem convinced that the US will gradually exit its prolonged period of excessive reliance on unconventional monetary policy, replacing it with a mix of looser fiscal policy and pro-growth structural reforms – an approach much like that pursued by former US President Ronald Reagan.
President Barack Obama sought to pursue a similar approach, but was frustrated by a highly polarized Congress.
The expectation that Trump will have better luck on this front has produced a textbook asset-price response.
Stock prices have climbed, led by financials and industrials; interest rates on US government bonds have risen, both on a standalone basis and relative to those in other advanced economies; and the dollar has surged to levels not seen since 2003.
Here is where the rest of the world comes in.
Other major economies – namely, in Europe and Asia – may have a much harder time than the US rebalancing their policy mix (which continues to be characterized by excessively loose monetary policy, inadequate structural reforms, and, in some cases, excessively tight fiscal policy).
But if they do not, the Fed’s continued interest-rate hikes would stimulate investors to trade their German and Japanese bonds, in particular – which are now bringing low and even negative returns – for higher-yielding US varieties.
The resultant wave of capital flows into the US would push up the value of the dollar even further.
Though the US economy is doing much better than most of the other advanced economies, it is not yet on sound enough footing to withstand a prolonged period of a substantially stronger dollar, which would undermine its international competitiveness – and thus its broader economic prospects.
Augmenting the risk is the prospect that such a development could spur the Trump administration to follow through on protectionist rhetoric, potentially undermining market and business confidence and, if things went far enough, even triggering a response from major trade partners.
If Trumponomics is to deliver on its promise, key countries – in particular, Germany (the largest and most influential European economy) and China and Japan (the world’s second- and third-largest economies, respectively) – must promote their own pro-growth policy adjustments.
They should implement quickly growth-enhancing structural reforms to support monetary stimulus.
Germany, in particular, would also need to pursue a looser fiscal policy, while adopting a more conciliatory attitude toward outright debt reduction for beleaguered Greece.
Unfortunately for Trump, the rest of the world does not seem prepared at this stage to pursue such a comprehensive policy shift.
That is why, beyond advancing Trump’s pro-growth economic agenda at home, the newly appointed members of his economic team should be establishing direct contact with their German, Chinese, and Japanese counterparts, with a view to improving international policy coordination.
Germany, China, and Japan have good reasons to embrace such an approach.
They are not getting enough out of monetary expansion at this point; the risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences is rising; and pro-growth structural reforms are overdue.
Furthermore, helping the US to achieve healthy and sustainable growth would bring about an indirect boost to their own economies.
And it would help to avoid a scenario in which a Trump administration, under political pressure, would threaten protectionist measures, increasing the risk of a trade war that would hurt nearly everyone.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s impending presidency, one thing is certain, at least on paper: he is in a strong position to boost US economic growth.
He and his team must, however, take the time to dismantle potential international barriers to success.
Financial Scarcity Amid Plenty
MILAN – With interest rates at all-time lows and central banks buying everything that moves, the world is awash with credit.
Yet, paradoxically, a dangerous shortage of international liquidity is putting the global economy at risk.
“International liquidity” refers to high-quality assets accepted around the world for paying import bills and servicing foreign debts. These are the same assets that central banks use when intervening in foreign-exchange markets.
They serve as reliable stores of value for international investors.
They provide pricing benchmarks in financial markets. And they are widely accepted as collateral for cross-border loans.
The key difference between these international assets and liquid assets in general, then, is that only the former are accepted in a large number of different countries and regularly used in transactions between them.
The single most important form of international liquidity is, of course, US government bonds, which are held by banks, firms, and other countries’ governments.
More generally, international liquidity comprises the liabilities of OECD countries’ central banks (their “high-powered money”), those countries’ AAA-rated and AA-rated central-government bonds, the debt securities of supranational organizations like the World Bank and regional development banks, and gold in official and private hands.
But add them up and you immediately come to a startling conclusion. International liquidity has plummeted from nearly 60% of global GDP in 2009 to barely 30% today.
This change is due, equally, to downgrades in the ratings of heavily indebted crisis countries’ government bonds, which make them unattractive for use in international transactions, and the inelasticity of other sources of supply.
Observers are perplexed by why global trade, having long grown faster than world GDP, is now expanding more slowly. They are also struggling to understand an unprecedented decline in global capital flows.
A shortage of international liquidity, by making it harder to finance and settle these cross-border transactions, is one explanation.
Urging the US government to issue more debt is no solution; doing so would only threaten rating downgrades and make foreign investors reluctant to hold US Treasury bonds.
Alternatively, one could urge crisis countries whose bonds have lost their investment-grade status to repair their finances so that these securities are again attractive for financing international transactions.
But financial strengthening takes time even for the most committed government, as any Greek official can tell you.
Can privately-issued obligations – high-grade corporate bonds, for example – supplement official forms of international liquidity?
This question dates back to the 1990s, when observers quaintly worried that the US government, by running surpluses, might retire its entire stock of debt.
It turned out that central banks and governments, in particular, were reluctant to hold private-label securities, even when these instruments had investment-grade ratings.
The reason is simple: Privately-issued assets without the backing of a government with the power of the purse might look safe in normal times; but, following a shock, they could quickly be reassessed as risky.
Others suggest that the International Monetary Fund could augment the supply of international liquidity by issuing Special Drawing Rights.
SDRs are accounting units made up of US dollars, British pounds, euros, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi. They can be credited to the accounts of IMF member countries, which are obliged to accept them in cross-border transactions under the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Voilà: problem solved.
Or not.
There are no private markets in SDRs.
To use them, a holder has to exchange them for, say, dollars in a transaction with the US government.
As a result, no additional liquidity is created.
The corresponding amount of dollar currency or deposits is simply transferred from one set of hands to another – from the US Treasury to the foreign holder.
Meanwhile, the world as a whole has gained no additional liquid resources.
Things would be different if, instead of allocating SDRs to governments, the IMF could sell them directly to central banks like the Fed, which, in return, would provide the Fund with additional dollars, which the Fund could then distribute among its members.
But while this is a neat solution in principle, the Fed and its political masters would surely be reluctant to cede control of the money printing press in practice.
Probably the most practical solution is to permit the IMF to borrow on private financial markets and use the proceeds to issue additional SDRs.
With member governments collectively guaranteeing its obligations, its bonds would be as good as gold.
To be sure, for their guarantee to be credible, members would have to commit to recapitalizing the Fund if it ever took losses on its loans. But, then, nothing is free.
Globalization’s benefits are sometimes exaggerated, but there have been important benefits.
Failure to address the international liquidity problem could jeopardize all that has been accomplished.
During the Cold War, ideological competition limited US-Soviet cooperation, but both sides’ awareness of nuclear destructiveness led them to develop a crude code of conduct to avoid military confrontation.
The Trouble with International Policy Coordination
BOLOGNA – After a 30-year hiatus, international coordination of macroeconomic policy seems to be back on policymakers’ agendas.
The reason is understandable: growth remains anemic in most countries, and many fear the US Federal Reserve’s impending interest-rate hike.
Unfortunately, the reasons why coordination fell into abeyance are still with us.
The heyday of international policy coordination, from 1978 to 1987, began with a G-7 summit in Bonn in 1978 and included the 1985 Plaza Accord.
But doubts about the benefits of such cooperation persisted.
The Germans, for example, regretted having agreed to joint fiscal expansion at the Bonn summit, because reflation turned out to be the wrong objective in the inflation-plagued late 1970s.
Similarly, the Japanese came to regret the appreciated yen after the Plaza Accord succeeded in bringing down an overvalued dollar.
Moreover, emerging-market countries’ representation in global governance did not keep pace with the increasingly significant role of their economies and currencies.
These countries’ very success thus became an obstacle to policy coordination.
The effort to revive international coordination began in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The larger emerging-market countries acquired more representation when the G-20 succeeded the G-7 as the preeminent global economic grouping.
G-20 leaders agreed on coordinated expansionary policies at their London summit in April 2009.
Then they agreed in Seoul in 2010 to give emerging-market countries quota shares in the International Monetary Fund that would be more commensurate with their economic weight.
(The US Congress, to its shame, has yet to pass the necessary legislation.)
Since then, many calls for coordination have lamented the outbreak of “currency wars,” otherwise known as competitive depreciation – an old phenomenon that recalls the tit-for-tat devaluations of the 1930s.
Now, as then, the fear is that if all countries try to depreciate their currency to gain export competitiveness and boost their economies, all will fail.
This concern has been reflected, for example, in complaints about intervention by China and other emerging markets to prevent currency appreciation.
Likewise, successive rounds of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve in 2009-2014, the Bank of Japan since 2013, and the European Central Bank since earlier this year, resulted in depreciations of the dollar, yen, and euro, respectively.
The most recent set of calls for coordination arise from fears – articulated, for example, by Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India – that the Fed will not adequately take into account the adverse impact on emerging-market economies when it raises interest rates.
The US has led some international attempts to address competitive depreciation, including an agreement among G-7 ministers in February 2013 to refrain from foreign-exchange intervention and a November 2015 side agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership to address currency manipulation.
But critics are agitating for a stronger agreement backed up by the threat of trade sanctions.
Attempting to use game theory to interpret the various calls for coordination is revealing, though not in the way that game theorists assume.
The players often do not think they are playing the same game.
For example, when the US urges German fiscal stimulus – as at it did in Bonn in 1978, in London in 2009, and at the G-20’s Brisbane summit in 2014 – it has in mind the “locomotive game,” in which fiscal stimulus has positive “spillover effects” on its trading partners.
The global economy will do better if the major countries – each afraid to undertake fiscal expansion on its own, for fear of worsening its trade balance – agree to act together to pull it out of recession and up to speed.
Germans, by contrast, think they are playing a “discipline game.”
They view budget deficits as creating negative spillover effects for neighbors, owing, for example, to the moral hazard of bailouts.
Their idea of a cooperative equilibrium is the European Union’s 2013 “fiscal compact,” under which euro members agreed yet again to rules for limiting their budget deficits.
The most recent example of this “dialogue of the deaf” occurred in Europe, from January to July 2015.
Month after month, the Greek government and its eurozone partners sat at the board, one side thinking the game was checkers and the other thinking it was chess.
Interpretations vary no less when it comes to monetary policy.
Some believe that monetary expansion in one country shifts the trade balance against its partners, owing to the exchange-rate effect; others believe that any adverse effect on trade balances is offset by higher spending.
Some argue that the problem is competitive depreciation or too-low interest rates; others maintain that the real problem is overvalued currencies or too-high interest rates.
Some believe that the way to overcome competitive depreciation for good is to fix exchange rates, as the architects of the Bretton Woods arrangements did in 1944; others, including some US politicians today, advocate the opposite approach: an agreement against seeking to influence exchange rates at all.
Yes, regular meetings of officials can be useful.
Consultation can minimize surprises.
Exchanges of views might help narrow differences in perceptions.
But some calls for international coordination are less useful, particularly when the aim is to blame foreigners in order to distract attention from domestic constraints and disagreements.
Consider the Brazilian officials who coined the phrase “currency wars” in 2010.
Their country’s budget deficit was too large, causing its economy to overheat.
Private demand was going to be crowded out one way or another, if not via currency appreciation, then via higher interest rates.
Yet officials blamed the US and others for the strong real.
Likewise, US politicians’ ongoing efforts to ban currency manipulation in trade agreements may be an effort to scapegoat Asians for US workers’ stagnant real incomes.
Officials would often be better advised to improve their own policies, before they tell others what to do.
Otherwise, calls for international cooperation may do more harm than good.
The Rule of the Lawless
CAIRO – In one of his last essays, the late, great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century, a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict.
One important part of the answer, I think, is the critical importance of the rule of law, both domestically and internationally.
To be sure, there are many other things that are crucial to the good life in peaceful, open societies: freedom of speech, religion, and association, and the power to choose – and remove – your own government.
But nothing guarantees free societies' liberties as much as the application of the rule of law with equal force to the governed and the governing.
When I was a British cabinet minister and chairman of the Conservative Party, I had a legal adviser who was aptly named Mr. Maybe.
When I was taken to task for some infringement of administrative law or alleged excessive use of my legal powers, he would never be able to tell me how the courts would ultimately rule.
“Will we win this case?" I'd ask Mr. Maybe.
His reply was always conditional.
“You should win," he once said.
“But I cannot promise that you will."
Authoritarian governments find this a difficult concept to understand.
I recall negotiations with my Chinese counterpart when I was Governor of Hong Kong.
I was attempting to explain why the rule of law mattered so much to the territory's future, and I noted that when I was in the British government, the law applied to me just as much as to those I helped govern.
My interlocutor thought I was joking.
What the Chinese practice is rule by law – the law as defined by the Communist Party to its own advantage.
Consider China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, for example.
It is plainly being used by President Xi Jinping and his ally in the Politburo, Wang Qishan, as a tool to target not just the corrupt, but those who are not part of Xi's faction of red princelings.
In Xi's hands, the law is an instrument for securing his political objectives.
Likewise, in Russia, President Vladimir Putin rules a state apparatus designed and run by elements of the country's old intelligence services and its new mafia.
The law is used to reward the regime's cronies and to penalize its critics, such as the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the activist Alexei Navalny.
Because neither Russia nor China apply the rule of law at home, it is unsurprising that they do not recognize its value in international affairs.
Indeed, Putin has breached one of the most fundamental principles of international law: that national borders may not be changed by force.
Indeed, he has made it a regular feature of Russian foreign policy, which is characterized by deceit, bullying, violence, and the desire to restore the empire that was dismembered after the collapse of communism.
Long before Russia's armed annexation of Crimea and its invasion of eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin played similar games when it engineered the secession of Georgia's South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions and propped up the bandit territory of Transnistria in Moldova.
And, given such blatant disregard for the international order, it is no surprise that Putin's agents have been implicated in the murder of at least one opponent on the streets of London.
Building on the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war and similar binding agreements, global rules were first institutionalized with the establishment of the United Nations.
But, above all, the international framework for managing global affairs was the creation of the United States.
What was remarkable about this framework was that its principal author, the major superpower of the day, accepted its authority.
As US President Harry Truman memorably put it, “We all have to recognize – no matter how great our strength – that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please."
In times when the international system has been under assault, only America has had the standing to provide renewed credibility to the rule of law.
Unfortunately, this may no longer be the case.
During President George W. Bush's administration, the US was willfully destructive of its global interests when it disregarded international law on issues like torture.
Those US politicians who regard international institutions as anti-American conspiracies are continuing the harm, costing their country much of its moral authority.
The picture is no brighter in Europe, where countries' willful neglect of their military capabilities has undermined their ability to enforce the rule of law when international mechanisms break down.
The UN Security Council, meanwhile, has become ineffectual, stymied by the great-power interests of China and Russia.
So it does nothing, even as Europe's borders are challenged, Ukrainian citizens are bombed in their homes by Russian troops, and a violent, bandit army ravages the greater Middle East, from the beaches of Libya to the borders of Iran.
After the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s, world leaders once again solemnly declared, “Never again."
Today, Syrian, Iraqi, and now Egyptian citizens must be wondering what happened to that pledge.
In short, the growing, bloody challenges of the twenty-first century are to be confronted by a toothless UN, a morally weakened US, and a Europe well on the path toward disarmament.
If that prospect worries you, it should.
In the absence of a change of heart by our political leaders, the power of prayer may be our only recourse.
International Taxation and Global Development
NEW YORK – When it comes to funding development, taxes are perhaps the most critical piece of the puzzle.
But the system of taxing global profits is broken – and it is exacerbating inequality both within and across countries.
If the world is to make progress toward its goals of eradicating poverty and stemming rising inequality, the system must be reformed.
The biggest problem with the current system is that, by taxing the subsidiaries of multinational corporations as separate entities, it provides plenty of room for global companies to dodge their tax obligations.
The reform efforts by the OECD, acting at the request of the G-20, represent welcome attempts to address so-called “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS), but they do not go far enough.
The most significant deliverable of the OECD’s BEPS initiative lies in its new country-by-country reporting requirements, which force multinationals to provide aggregate information annually, in each jurisdiction where they do business, relating to the global allocation of income and taxes paid.
They must also provide information about which entities do business in each jurisdiction and the economic activities in which they engage.
But such reporting will apply only to entities with revenues above €750 million ($845 million) and will not be made public.
Furthermore, countries have to meet certain conditions to access the information – a structure that will not benefit most developing countries.
Yet developing countries have the most at stake.
Indeed, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that developing countries lose three times more of their corporate-tax revenue to BEPS activities than their developed counterparts.
According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, such activities by multinationals – which represent one-third of the potential corporate-tax base in developing countries – result in annual losses of $100 billion.
Given the major role that tax revenues play in funding development efforts – providing two-thirds of the financing for the UN Millennium Development Goals, with official aid and private flows covering the rest – the bleeding must be stanched.
As world leaders gear up for this month’s Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD3) in Addis Ababa, where they will develop a strategy to fund the post-2015 global development agenda, a move toward a more efficient and equitable global tax system could not be more urgent.
That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), which I chair.
We believe that the world has an unprecedented opportunity to bring about significant reform of the international corporate-taxation system that serves the global public interest, rather than national advantage.
To help induce world leaders to take advantage of this opportunity, the ICRICT has issued a set of recommendations for reform of the rules and institutions governing international corporate-taxation.
The proposals include a minimum corporate tax agreed by developed countries, and mechanisms to prevent multinationals from shifting their profits to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions.
Moreover, in contrast to the OECD reforms, the ICRICT recommends public reporting by multinationals on taxes paid in all jurisdictions.
And, in the longer term, it calls for a transition to a system in which multinationals are taxed as one firm, with taxes allocated to the different countries in which they operate according to an agreed-upon formula.
A first step toward achieving these objectives would be the establishment of an intergovernmental body with the mandate and resources to push through much-needed tax reform, while promoting stronger tax cooperation among governments.
The decision about whether to establish such a body is an important feature of the FFD3 agenda.
Such a globally representative forum on taxation should not only serve as a venue for inter-governmental cooperation; it should also support a broader, more inclusive debate on tax reform.
For too long, such discussions have been the preserve of closed-door negotiations among governments and large corporations, with the topic considered too technical for the general public to understand.
Even now, many argue that including everyone in the discussion would result in politicization of the tax system, and that decisions should thus be left to the experts.
But taxation is inherently political, as it involves issues of equity, justice, and the common good.
Indeed, issues of taxation were at the heart of the creation of modern democratic parliaments.
An issue with such far-reaching consequences should not be debated in secrecy.
If world leaders are serious about reducing inequality and eradicating poverty, they must commit to creating a just and transparent tax system.
One hopes that this month in Addis Ababa, they take credible steps in that direction.
Inequality and the Internet
BERKELEY – The conclusion that America has become vastly more unequal over the past 35 years is beyond doubt.
Since 1979, the pattern has been clear: The richer you were, the far richer you have become.
And if you were poor, you probably stayed poor.
But the same period has also been an era of rapid technological change.
The United States is undergoing a third industrial revolution, an information-age upheaval that could be as momentous as its predecessors, which transformed society through the introduction of steam, iron, cotton, and machinery, and then internal combustion, electricity, and steel.
Today, nearly every resident of a developed country – and soon most of the rest of the world – can easily afford a smartphone, thereby gaining inexpensive access to a universe of human knowledge and entertainment that, until a generation ago, was far beyond the reach of all but the rich.
Is it possible that conventional measures of inequality and income vastly underestimate just how good we have it?
According to conventional economics, the answer, at first glance, seems to be no.
The calculations of economic growth that reveal growing inequality already take into account spending on telecommunications, information processing, and audiovisual entertainment.
Unless the benefits from information-age goods and services greatly outstrip what we spend on them, the wellbeing they provide will have already been accounted for.
But is that “unless” really so far-fetched?
When we invest in our wellbeing, we not only spend money to purchase goods and services; we allocate a portion of our free time to use them properly.
A movie ticket will not do you much good if you leave before the curtain rises.
Time, like money, is a scarce resource; and, because goods and services related to information require our attention, they are time-intensive.
Ever since Homer chanted his Iliad around the campfire after dark, we have been willing to pay dearly for stories, entertainment, and information.
The technology of the information age has given us the possibility to invest our time in ways that once only the most powerful could afford.
If, in the seventeenth century, you wanted to watch Macbeth in your house, you had to be named James Stuart, have William Shakespeare and his acting company on retainer, and have a full-sized theater in your royal palace.
We spend, on average, two hours a day with our audio-video devices.
Assume for a minute that the opportunities provided by the rollout of broadband Internet has at least doubled the utility – the pleasure – that we get during that time.
That is the equivalent of receiving an extra two hours of free time every day, on top of the ten hours on average that we spend awake and not at work.
Put in economic terms, that is an extra rise of 0.6% per year in standards of living since 1990, a far larger increase than the 0.2% per year that reliance on conventional measures would lead us to conclude.
The question then becomes whether our smartphones, Kindles, tablets, and computers actually do provide us that extra utility.
Do we value what we get from Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, and the Internet’s online library of humanity far more than what we previously learned, listened to, watched, or gossiped about through traditional means?
Is watching television on demand more rewarding than visiting a movie theater?
Is your Twitter stream more illuminating than a trip to a nearby library?
Are Facebook friends more valuable than, well, friends?
Whatever the answer to those questions, there is an even bigger wrinkle.
We do not consume goods and services in a vacuum.
Part of the pleasure we receive from them derives from a feeling that our status is rising relative to that of our peers.
The information age has not only provided us with new entertainment options; it has opened new vistas into our neighbors’ lifestyles – and what we have noticed is that some of them are getting much, much richer.
If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that, as a society, the benefits we have received from information-age technology have been neutralized by the envy and spite that results from living in a world that is ever more unequal.
Connectivity for All
OXFORD – Over the last decade, the number of new Internet users tripled.
But, though a large majority of the world’s population remains offline, the pace of expansion has slowed sharply in recent years.
Is the Internet revolution losing steam?
From 2005 to 2008, the number of Internet users increased at a compound annual rate of 15.1%, bringing the number of people online to some 2.7 billion.
But, according to a new report by&nbsp;McKinsey &amp; Company, the growth rate fell to 10.4% in 2010-2013.
Given the enormous economic benefits of connectivity, finding ways to provide Internet access to the world’s remaining four billion people should be a high priority.
Of course, that is easier said than done.
Around three-quarters of the unconnected – 3.4 billion people – live in just 20 countries.
In 2012, about 64% lived in rural areas, compared with only 24% of Internet users, while about half live below their country’s poverty line and median income.
Some 18% are older than 54, compared with about 7% of the online population, and roughly 28% are illiterate, whereas the literacy rate for Internet users is close to 100%.
Finally, women comprise 52% of the offline population and only 42% of the online population.
These groups face particularly high barriers to Internet connectivity, beginning with inadequate infrastructure, including poor mobile Internet coverage or network access and unreliable electricity supply.
Indeed, 1.1-2.8 billion people cannot get online via a mobile network, because their area lacks sufficient coverage.
Another barrier is affordability: Internet access is simply too costly for many low-income people.
Beyond the need to address insufficient competition, inadequate regulation, and high taxes on Internet-enabled devices and service plans, there is the fundamental challenge of supplying cost-effective access to the most remote regions.
In ten countries, largely in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, fixed broadband prices exceed per capita GDP.
The third major barrier to Internet adoption is user capability.
The high level of illiteracy among those who remain offline often implies an inability not only to read and write, but also to use digital technology.
An estimated 43% of India’s unconnected citizens are illiterate.
Without technological solutions, such as user interfaces that feature text-to-speech and voice-recognition capabilities, people who have not attained basic language proficiency will struggle to engage with Internet content.
The lack of relevant local-language content may also limit use.
Making matters worse, misperceptions of the Internet – for example, that it is a security risk or solely for the wealthy – mean that many people will remain reluctant to use it, even if affordable access becomes available.
In many emerging economies, a lack of trust in the system has fueled resistance to doing business online.
The final barrier to Internet adoption is a lack of incentives.
As research by the Oxford Internet Institute on broadband in East Africa has shown, many poor people in rural areas may know little, if anything, about the Internet, or may not be offered it.
Given that tailoring content to such potential customers is expensive, Internet service providers are unlikely to do so without clear incentives like government support or high profit margins.
Advertisers are not interested in reaching such markets.
McKinsey has developed a new Internet Barriers Index that ranks 25 developed and developing countries on their performance in the face of these challenges.
The top five countries are the United States, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Spain.
The bottom five are Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.
Nearly half of the world’s offline population lives in ten countries that face a significant struggle to overcome all four barriers.
In the bottom five countries in the McKinsey index, the average Internet penetration rate was only 15% in 2013.
The offline population was largely young and rural, with low literacy rates.
Five other countries – Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand – face medium to high barriers across the board, especially when it comes to infrastructure and incentives.
With an offline population of more than 1.4 billion people, these countries had an average Internet penetration rate of 19% in 2013.
Another 1.1 billion people live in countries where a single barrier – especially a lack of awareness of the Internet, weak purchasing power, or low levels of digital literacy – dominates.
Identifying the particular barriers affecting a country or region enables the development of effective solutions – not least because some barriers, such as awareness, are far cheaper to tackle than others, like infrastructure.
That is the purpose of the Internet Barriers Index.
By mapping the major social, political, and economic obstacles to Internet adoption, the index can help make efforts by governments and network and service providers as targeted and efficient as possible.
The imperative to address the formidable challenges to further expansion of Internet usage is clear.
Doing so would create considerable potential for economic growth.
Many governments have recognized this to some extent, setting ambitious goals for mobile Internet coverage, broadband infrastructure, and public Wi-Fi access.
But investment in infrastructure is not enough.
Only comprehensive, targeted, and nationally tailored strategies, backed by a strong commitment from policymakers, can bring the next one billion people online.
The Digital Transformation of Europe
SAN JOSE – Europe is on the cusp of an unprecedented technological transformation.
I call it the Internet of Everything: the penetration of the World Wide Web into the everyday aspects of our lives.
Wearable technology will tell us how well we are sleeping and whether we need to exercise.
Sensors in the street will help us avoid traffic jams and find parking.
Telemedicine applications will allow physicians to treat patients who are hundreds of miles away.
This massive transition will transform how citizens interact with their governments, revolutionize entire industries, and change the way we engage with one another.
In Europe, the Internet of Everything is emerging as the single most promising way to revive a moribund economy and tackle the continent's stubborn unemployment problem, with companies, cities, and even countries positioning themselves as leaders in innovation, growth, and the creation of jobs.
The most recent example is France.
Last month, Prime Minister Manuel Valls and I announced an ambitious partnership to promote a digital transformation of the entire country.
The collaboration, which includes a $100 million investment from Cisco in French startups, could transform energy management, health care, and education – boosting France's economic competitiveness, job creation, dynamism, and growth in the process.
France's program is a major step toward a digital Europe, following German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Industrie 4.0 initiative and the United Kingdom's planned expansion of innovation centers to foster technological breakthroughs and pioneer solutions in energy, transport, health care, and education.
Cities too are embracing digitization.
Barcelona has installed in-ground parking sensors and launched connected public transportation as part of its Smart City strategy.
Nice has constructed a “connected boulevard," including smart lighting and environmental monitoring.
And the Port of Hamburg has a digital system to reduce water, rail, and ground traffic congestion.
Projects like these are being replicated across the continent, generating billions of dollars in value in terms of reduced costs, productivity gains, and increased revenues.
As a result, Europe's leaders see not only opportunities for growth, but also the need to avoid being left behind.
To create a truly digital Europe will require a foundation of high-speed, high-quality broadband, both wired and wireless.
As part of Europe's Digital Agenda, policymakers have set out to connect 50% of European households to superfast broadband (100 mbps or greater) by 2020.
They also aim to connect all residences to broadband (at least 30 mbps) by this time.
These targets should be fully embraced, and policymakers should continue to encourage major investments in broadband, as well as in the infrastructure needed to support the wireless devices in which we have all come to depend.
Of course, Europe will also have to encourage entrepreneurship, which requires fostering a culture of risk-taking, facilitating access to venture capital, and investing in strong educational institutions.
Many countries are doing just that, implying that the next game-changing technology may not come from Silicon Valley; it could just as easily be developed in a lab in Paris, London, or Berlin.
Over the longer term, Europe will need a workforce trained for careers in the new digitized economy.
It is estimated that Europe will have an e-skills gap that, if filled, could lead to 850,000 potential jobs in 2015, rising to twice that by 2020.
On a continent where youth unemployment exceeds 50% in some countries, there should be no problem finding young and eager people able to do these jobs, provided they receive the proper training.
This gap cannot be closed overnight, but countries that do nothing to overcome it could very well fall behind.
Widening the talent pipeline sufficiently will require a generational commitment to teaching math and science, providing technical training, and mentoring young people of all backgrounds so they understand the full range of possibilities that a career in technology affords.
As Europe continues down the road of digital transformation, the possibilities for growth are immediate and significant.
The continent is already the world's largest economic bloc, with a GDP of more than €14 trillion ($15.2 trillion) in 2014.
But its growth has been waning.
The European Commission estimates – conservatively, in my opinion – that the digital revolution could spur an “additional 2.1% of GDP growth over the baseline."
On the jobs front, the Internet of Everything will be a key driver of employment.
Advances in cloud computing alone are expected to create 2.5 million additional jobs in Europe by 2020.
The digital transformation will bring opportunities and create new types of jobs: systems developers, transportation network engineers, medical device consultants, data analysts, electrical engineers for smart grids, and many more.
As Europe charts its economic course for the next decade, its leaders must ensure that digital transformation forms the foundation of their strategy.
This will allow them to create a Europe that is stronger, faster, more dynamic – and more digital.
Internet or Splinternet?
CAMBRIDGE – Who owns the Internet?
The answer is no one and everyone.
The Internet is a network of networks.
Each of the separate networks belongs to different companies and organizations, and they rely on physical servers in different countries with varying laws and regulations.
But without some common rules and norms, these networks cannot be linked effectively.
Fragmentation – meaning the end of the Internet – is a real threat.
Some estimates put the Internet’s economic contribution to global GDP as high as $4.2 trillion in 2016.
A fragmented “splinternet” would be very costly to the world, but that is one of the possible futures outlined last month in the report of the Global Commission on Internet Governance, chaired by former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt.
The Internet now connects nearly half the world’s population, and another billion people – as well as some 20 billion devices – are forecast to be connected in the next five years.
But further expansion is not guaranteed.
In the Commission’s worst-case scenario, the costs imposed by the malicious actions of criminals and the political controls imposed by governments would cause people to lose trust in the Internet and reduce their use of it.
The cost of cybercrime in 2016 has been estimated to be as high as $445 billion, and it could grow rapidly.
As more devices, ranging from automobiles to pacemakers, are placed online, malicious hackers could turn the “Internet of Things” (IOT) into “the weaponization of everything.”
Massive privacy violations by companies and governments, and cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure such as power grids (as recently happened in Ukraine), could create insecurity that undercuts the Internet’s potential.
A second scenario is what the Commission calls “stunted growth.”
Some users capture disproportionate gains, while others fail to benefit.
Three or four billion people are still offline, and the Internet’s economic value for many who are connected is compromised by trade barriers, censorship, laws requiring local storage of data, and other rules that limit the free flow of goods, services, and ideas.
The movement toward sovereign control of the Internet is growing, and a degree of fragmentation already exists.
China has the largest number of Internet users, but its “Great Fire Wall” has created barriers with parts of the outside world.
Many governments censor services that they think threaten their political control.
If this trend continues, it could cost more than 1% of GDP per year, and also impinge on peoples’ privacy, free speech, and access to knowledge.
While the world could muddle along this path, a great deal will be lost and many will be left behind.
In the Commission’s third scenario, a healthy Internet provides unprecedented opportunities for innovation and economic growth.
The Internet revolution of the past two decades has contributed something like 8% of global GDP and brought three billion users online, narrowing digital, physical, economic, and educational divides.
The Commission’s report states that the IOT may result in up to $11 trillion in additional GDP by 2025.
The Commission concluded that sustaining unhindered innovation will require that the Internet’s standards are openly developed and available; that all users develop better digital “hygiene” to discourage hackers; that security and resilience be at the core of system design (rather than an afterthought, as they currently are); that governments not require third parties to compromise encryption; that countries agree not to attack the Internet’s core infrastructure; and that governments mandate liability and compel transparent reporting of technological problems to provide a market-based insurance industry to enhance the IOT’s security.
Until recently, the debate about the most appropriate approach to Internet governance revolved around three main camps.
The first, multi-stakeholder approach, originated organically from the community that developed the Internet, which ensured technical proficiency but not international legitimacy, because it was heavily dominated by American technocrats.
A second camp favored greater control by the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations specialized agency, which ensured legitimacy but at the cost of efficiency.
And authoritarian countries like Russia and China championed international treaties guaranteeing no interference with states’ strong sovereign control over their portion of the Internet.
More recently, the Commission argues, a fourth model is developing in which a broadened multi-stakeholder community involves more conscious planning for the participation of each stakeholder (the technical community, private organizations, companies, governments) in international conferences.
An important step in this direction was the US Commerce Department’s decision last month to hand oversight of the so-called IANA functions – the “address book” of the Internet – to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
ICANN, with a Government Advisory Committee of 162 members and 35 observers, is not a typical inter-governmental organization: the governments do not control the organization.
At the same time, ICANN is consistent with the multi-stakeholder approach formulated and legitimated by the Internet Governance Forum, established by the UN General Assembly.
Some American senators complained that when President Barack Obama’s Commerce Department handed its oversight of the IANA functions to ICANN, it was “giving away the Internet.”
But the US could not “give away” the Internet, because the United States does not own it.
While the original Internet linked computers entirely in the US, today’s Internet connects billions of people worldwide.
Moreover, the IANA address book (of which there are many copies) is not the Internet.
The US action last month was a step toward a more stable and open multi-stakeholder Internet of the type that the Global Commission applauded.
Let’s hope that further steps in this direction follow.
Golden Slumbers
CAMBRIDGE – In principle, holding gold is a form of insurance against war, financial Armageddon, and wholesale currency debasement.
And, from the onset of the global financial crisis, the price of gold has often been portrayed as a barometer of global economic insecurity.
So, does the collapse in gold prices – from a peak of $1,900 per ounce in August 2011 to under $1,250 at the beginning of July 2013 – represent a vote of confidence in the global economy?
To say that the gold market displays all of the classic features of a bubble gone bust is to oversimplify.
There is no doubt that gold’s heady rise to the peak, from around $350 per ounce in July 2003, had investors drooling.
The price would rise today because everyone had become convinced that it would rise even further tomorrow.
Doctors and dentists started selling stocks and buying gold coins.
Demand for gold jewelry in India and China soared.
Emerging-market central banks diversified out of dollars and into gold.
The case for buying gold had several strong components.
Ten years ago, gold was selling at well below its long-term inflation-adjusted average, and the integration of three billion emerging-market citizens into the global economy could only mean a giant long-term boost to demand.
That element of the story, incidentally, remains valid.
The global financial crisis added to gold’s allure, owing initially to fear of a second Great Depression.
Later, some investors feared that governments would unleash inflation to ease the burden of soaring public debt and address persistent unemployment.
As central banks brought policy interest rates down to zero, no one cared that gold yields no interest.
So it is nonsense to say that the rise in the price of gold was all a bubble.
But it is also true that as the price rose, a growing number of naïve investors sought to buy in.
Lately, of course, the fundamentals have reversed somewhat, and the speculative frenzy has reversed even more.
China’s economy continues to soften; India’s growth rate is down sharply from a few years ago.
By contrast, despite the ill-advised fiscal sequester, the US economy appears to be healing gradually.
Global interest rates have risen 100 basis points since the US Federal Reserve started suggesting – quite prematurely, in my view – that it would wind down its policy of quantitative easing.
With the Fed underscoring its strong anti-inflation bias, it is harder to argue that investors need gold as a hedge against high inflation.
And, as the doctors and dentists who were buying gold coins two years ago now unload them, it is not yet clear where the downward price spiral will stop.
Some are targeting the psychologically compelling $1,000 barrier.
In fact, the case for or against gold has not changed all that much since 2010, when I last wrote about it.
In October of that year, the price of gold – the consummate faith-based speculative asset – was on the way up, having just hit $1,300.
But the real case for holding it, then as now, was never a speculative one.
Rather, gold is a hedge.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, or a sovereign wealth fund, it makes perfect sense to hold a small percentage of your assets in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
Holding gold can also make sense for middle-class and poor households in countries – for example, China and India – that significantly limit access to other financial investments.
For most others, gold is just another gamble that one can make.
And, as with all gambles, it is not necessarily a winning one.
Unless governments firmly set the price of gold, as they did before World War I, the market for it will inevitably be risky and volatile.
In a study published in January, the economists Claude Erb and Campbell Harvey consider several possible models of gold’s fundamental price, and find that gold is at best only loosely tethered to any of them.
Instead, the price of gold often seems to drift far above or far below its fundamental long-term value for extended periods.
(This behavior is, of course, not unlike that of many other financial assets, such as exchange rates or stock prices, though gold’s price swings may be more extreme.)
Gold bugs sometimes cite isolated historical data that suggest that gold’s long-term value has remained stable over the millennia.
For example, Stephen Harmston’s oft-cited 1998 study points to anecdotal evidence that an ounce of gold bought 350 loaves of bread in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who died in 562 BC.
Ignoring the fact that bread in Babylon was probably healthier than today’s highly refined product, the price of gold today is not so different, equal to perhaps 600 loaves of bread.
Of course, we do not have annual data for Babylonian gold prices.
We can only assume, given wars and other uncertainties, that true market prices back then, like today, were quite volatile.
So the recent collapse of gold prices has not really changed the case for investing in it one way or the other.
Yes, prices could easily fall below $1,000; but, then again, they might rise.
Meanwhile, policymakers should be cautious in interpreting the plunge in gold prices as a vote of confidence in their performance.
The New Interventionists
MUNICH – The consequences of Russia’s intervention in Syria stretch far beyond the Middle East.
The Kremlin’s military campaign has tilted the stalemate in favor of the government and derailed efforts to craft a political compromise to end the war.
It also heralds the beginning of a new era in geopolitics, in which large-scale military interventions are not carried out by Western coalitions, but by countries acting in their own narrow self-interest, often in contravention of international law.
Since the end of the Cold War, the debate over international military action has pitted powerful, interventionist Western powers against weaker countries, like Russia and China, whose leaders argued that national sovereignty is sacrosanct and inviolable.
The unfolding developments in Syria are further evidence that the tables are turning.
While the West is losing its appetite for intervention – particularly involving ground troops – countries like Russia, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are increasingly intervening in their neighbors’ affairs.
In the 1990s, after genocides in Rwanda and the Balkans, Western countries developed a doctrine of so-called humanitarian intervention.
“The Responsibility to Protect” (colloquially known as “R2P”) held countries accountable for their people’s welfare and compelled the international community to intervene when governments failed to protect civilians from mass atrocities – or were themselves threatening civilians.
The doctrine upended the traditional concept of national sovereignty, and in countries like Russia and China, it quickly came to be viewed as little more than a fig leaf for Western-sponsored regime change.
So it is ironic, to say the least, that Russia is using a concept similar to R2P to justify its intervention, only in this case it is defending the government from its citizens, rather than the other way around.
Russia’s efforts are, in effect, an argument for a return to the era of absolute sovereignty, in which governments are uniquely responsible for what happens within their country’s borders.
Russia’s stance also reflects its preference for stability over justice and its acceptance of the legitimacy of authoritarian rule.
With the proliferation of “color revolutions” in places like Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, Russia and China have become increasingly wary of popular uprisings.
The threat of Western intervention, in their view, only compounds the potential for instability.
Indeed, the Chinese have coined their own stiff foreign-policy jargon for this sentiment: fanxifang xin ganshe zhuyi (loosely translated, “countering Western neo-interventionism”).
But Russia’s respect for sovereignty has notable limits.
In Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin embraced a very different doctrine of intervention, justifying its actions in Ukraine on the grounds that it was defending the rights of ethnic Russians.
This marks a return to a pre-Westphalian world of linguistic, religious, and sectarian solidarity, of the sort Czarist Russia practiced when it regarded itself as the protector of all Slavs.
Not surprisingly, this justification for intervention is rapidly finding adherents in other parts of the world.
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has adopted a parallel argument for its support of Sunni forces in Yemen and Syria, as has Iran in backing its Shia allies in both countries.
Even China is increasingly being pushed to take responsibility for its citizens and companies overseas.
At the beginning of the Libyan civil war, China airlifted tens of thousands of its citizens out of the country.
All of this has come at a time when the West is losing its military preeminence.
Improvements in the Russian and Chinese militaries and the increasingly common use of asymmetric strategies by state and non-state actors are leveling the battlefield.
Indeed, the proliferation of state-sponsored non-state actors in places like Libya, Syria, Crimea, and Donbas is blurring the distinction between state and non-state violence.
After the Cold War, the West imposed an international order that defined geopolitics worldwide.
When that order was threatened, Western leaders felt authorized to intervene in the affairs of whatever “rogue state” was causing the problem.
But now that order is being challenged on several fronts simultaneously – globally by Russia and China, and at the regional level by increasingly assertive players in the Middle East, Latin America, and even Europe.
As a new order takes shape, the roles countries have played for the last 25 years are likely to be reversed.
In the West, the concept of sovereignty and the limited use of power is likely to make a comeback, while national leaders who have traditionally called for restraint will become increasingly bold in unleashing their troops.
The Wrong Lessons of the Iraq War
WASHINGTON, DC – The Chilcot report was finally released this month, seven years after it was commissioned by the British government to “identify lessons” from the United Kingdom’s participation in the Iraq War.
But in the frenzied focus on former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s errors of judgment and process in bringing the UK into the war alongside the United States, the real lessons risk being lost.
For many critics, the failure of the Iraq War proves that interventionist Western foreign policies are both futile and immoral.
But interventions should never be assessed on the basis of the success or failure of the last one.
That logic is what led Bill Clinton’s administration, following the failure of US intervention in Somalia in 1993, to fail to act the following year to prevent the genocide in Rwanda, which in retrospect could have been halted with quite limited action.
In the case of the Iraq War, the intervention killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and shattered the country, as well as costing the lives of thousands of US and British soldiers.
The tragic legacy of the Iraqi intervention continues today, however, because it now stands as a cautionary tale against all intervention.
President Barack Obama has repeatedly justified his refusal to use force in Syria, other than against the Islamic State (ISIS), in terms of avoiding another Iraq.
Moreover, his decisions have been affected by British reactions to Iraq.
Indeed, Obama came closest to using force in Syria when presented with unequivocal evidence in the summer of 2013 that President Bashar al-Assad was using chemical weapons against his citizens.
But he changed his mind, in part based on former UK Prime Minister David Cameron’s failure to win parliamentary support to act against Assad’s regime.
Despite Cameron’s warning that “this is not like Iraq…we must not let the spectre of previous mistakes paralyze us,” members of his Conservative Party joined with opposition Labour MPs to defeat the motion to launch airstrikes in Syria in response to Assad’s chemical-weapons attacks.
After the defeat, British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond recognized that it was the Iraq War that had “poisoned the well” of public opinion, while former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the British public, “want us to learn the lessons of Iraq.”
The Chilcot report found that the case for invading Iraq was made on the “basis of flawed intelligence,” that the resources committed did not meet the stated goals, and that interveners failed to plan for unintended consequences.
As a result, Britain ended its six-year commitment in Iraq “a very long way from success.”
This catalogue of failure should not be read as a brief against all intervention, but as a set of criteria for future success.
First, the intelligence must be cross-examined from every conceivable angle.
This maxim was not applied in Libya, either, such that the initial reports of a potential massacre of hundreds of thousands of people in Benghazi has since come under sustained and credible attack.
Second, the means and the ends must be at least roughly aligned.
Transforming a dictatorship into a democracy in a country that has never known democracy and lacked the economic and civic resources to sustain it was at least a generation-long endeavor (though neither the US nor the UK government initially justified the intervention on these grounds).
The original stated end of removing weapons of mass destruction could have been achieved at much lower cost, had such weapons in fact existed.
Third, intervention planners should assume worst-case rather than best-case scenarios.
The cost of non-intervention must be as high as or higher than the projected cost of intervention (where many things that can go wrong frequently do).
These lessons set a high bar for any future intervention.
But it is a bar cleared by at least some proposed measures in Syria.
The intelligence concerning Assad’s atrocities against his own is irrefutable.
The stated goal of intervention in Syria should be to stop Assad from committing mass murder against his own population, which has forced millions to flee the country, and to convince him and his supporters that if they cannot win by any means, they are better off negotiating a genuine peace settlement, however fragile.
To achieve this specific end, the means are available and calibrated: the targets should be Assad’s air force and airports.
The US and its allies are already bombing perpetrators of crimes against humanity in Syria, but only when those perpetrators belong to ISIS rather than to the Syrian government.
Finally, if such an intervention failed either to stop Assad’s massacre of civilians or to create the conditions for a negotiated peace, Syria would be no worse off than it is today.
The fear is that weakening Assad will strengthen ISIS, and that a Syria overrun by ISIS would be worse for the West, for other countries in the Middle East, and arguably for Syrians.
But Assad actively benefits from the presence of ISIS in Syria; it reinforces precisely the counterterrorist narrative that he has promoted since the first peaceful protests against his government began in March 2011.
And Syrians across the country will fight ISIS just as fiercely with or without Assad’s air force.
Russia and Iran will continue to fight ISIS as well.
One of Chilcot’s main conclusions is surely correct: “aspects of any intervention need to be calculated, debated, and challenged with the utmost rigour.”
That said, intervention can still be the right course.
Three Ways to Improve Child Health
SEATTLE – Over the last 15 years, the international community has made great strides in improving child health.
But, with millions of children under the age of five dying each year from preventable and treatable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia, the job is far from finished.
Most people would say that malaria or even HIV/AIDS are the leading child killers.
In fact, diarrhea and pneumonia top the charts as the biggest threats to child survival – as they have for the more than 30 years that we have been tracking them.
According to the recently published 2016 Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report, the two diseases caused 1.4 million child deaths last year, and one-quarter of all deaths of children under the age of five.
They exact their highest toll in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Tackling the two biggest killers of children worldwide may seem daunting, but we have all the knowledge we need to mount an effective response.
Indeed, we know which viruses, bacteria, and parasites we need to target; which interventions are likely to work; and which countries need them the most.
Just 15 countries account for 72% of childhood deaths from pneumonia and diarrhea.
These are the countries on which the Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report focuses.
Its analysis of national efforts shows that, while most countries have made improvements over the last year, improvement in some of the largest countries has been minimal, and a few countries have not made any progress at all.
Most deaths happen in the first two years of a child’s life.
To change this, governments need to step up their efforts to prevent pneumonia and diarrhea, including by ensuring that parents have access to the information they need to protect their children.
Here, it is critical that ordinary citizens stand up and hold their governments accountable.
The good news is that there are three relatively simple interventions that could make a big difference.
The first is breastfeeding.
An age-old, no-cost intervention, breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of a baby’s life is one of the easiest ways to prevent both diarrhea and pneumonia.
Breast milk has all the nutrients babies need to grow, as well as antibodies that boost their immune systems, thereby protecting against illness and helping to accelerate recovery.
The Progress Report estimates that about half of all diarrhea episodes, and about a third of respiratory infections, could be averted by breastfeeding.
Yet rates of exclusive breastfeeding during a child’s first six months remain low.
In ten of the 15 countries evaluated in the Progress Report, fewer than half of mothers exclusively breastfeed their children.
To increase breastfeeding rates, governments need to ensure that mothers receive the guidance and help they need.
That means training health workers; establishing community-level support networks, such as mother-to-mother groups; investing in behavioral-change campaigns; and creating a culture in which breastfeeding is welcome and encouraged.
The second critical intervention is improved water, sanitation, and hygiene in homes and communities.
Globally, according to UNICEF, around 2.4 billion people still do not have access to modern sanitation, and 663 million do not have access to safe water sources.
Many kids still lack clean drinking water, access to basic toilets, and good hygiene practices.
Poor water quality and lack of reliable sanitation systems to treat human waste play a big role in spreading diseases.
UNICEF reports that something as simple as hand washing with soap can cut rates of diarrhea and respiratory infections by more than 40% and 25%, respectively.
By investing not only in systems to provide clean drinking water and sanitation, but also in educational programs that encourage better hygiene practices and toilet use, governments can break a vicious cycle of diarrhea and malnutrition that causes irreversible physical and cognitive damage.
The children they help are more likely to be able to attend school, and grow into healthy, educated adults.
The third key intervention is vaccination.
Vaccines represent the most cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood illness, and they already exist for most common bacterial causes of pneumonia (pneumococcus and Hib) and for the leading causes of diarrhea (rotavirus).
Yet half of the world’s children live in areas where the pneumococcal vaccine is not available through a national immunization program, and only 15% of the children in the world’s poorest countries have access to the rotavirus vaccine.
By making vaccines available through national immunization programs, governments can protect all children from the diseases that are most likely to harm or kill them.
Efforts to ensure that families take advantage of vaccination services, including by educating parents about their value, will also be needed.
Pneumonia and diarrhea should not still be taking children’s lives.
No single intervention will be enough.
But the accelerated and coordinated implementation of the three interventions described here could go a long way toward preventing pneumonia and diarrhea, especially for the most vulnerable children, enabling them to lead healthy, productive lives.
In the Footsteps of Gandhi, Mandela, and Havel
LONDON – Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned Chinese writer and human-rights campaigner, will receive the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10.
For the first time in history, however, neither the laureate nor any member of his immediate family will be present in Oslo to accept the award.
China’s government has blocked Liu’s wife, the acclaimed photographer Liu Xia, from participating by keeping her under virtual house arrest in Beijing.
It has browbeaten other countries into boycotting the award ceremony.
Not surprisingly, Vladimir Putin’s Russia was among the first to kowtow to China’s Diktat. More ominously, it looked for a while like the Norwegian Nobel committee itself might bow to Beijing, too.
But in the end it decided to go ahead with the award. That is only fitting: an award for moral courage ought not to be compromised by those offering it.
When Liu learned that he had been awarded this year‘s Nobel Peace Prize, his first reaction was telling: “This prize is given to the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.”
That simple phrase neatly encapsulates Liu’s peaceful 20-year-resistance to China’s government, which began with a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square.
Over the next two decades, he was imprisoned several times, and held under house arrest when not in prison.
Despite this ongoing persecution, Liu continued to write and petition the government on behalf of the people of China.
Like the greatest non-violent freedom fighters of modern times – Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and Václav Havel – he sacrificed his own freedom to highlight his people’s lack of it.
Today, many individuals and countries are demonstrating their support for the Nobel Peace Prize Committee’s decision to award the prize to Liu.
Indeed, Havel and a previous laureate, Desmond Tutu, were consistent advocates of awarding the prize to him.
But, in addition to supporting Liu’s achievements by making certain that they are represented at the ceremony in Oslo, world leaders need to come to grips with the Chinese government’s reaction.
Although much of the world recognizes that it is in economic competition with China, it often fails to see that it is also in moral competition with China.
The Communist Party of China used to rule a destitute power. But, having become much richer over the past three decades, China is now proposing to the world its own model of development – and, indeed, of civilization.
This model, which some have dubbed “The Beijing Consensus” is explicit: there are no moral standards, only material ones.
Human rights and freedom can be made to disappear not only from Web sites, but also from reality.
Though now better off than they have ever been in material terms, the Chinese people under the current regime are denied any real opportunity to retain and refine their own dignity beyond the quest for wealth and luxury goods.
Liu’s prize is a rebuke to the regime, because it rejects the dogma that nothing but the pursuit of economic interest matters.
China’s rulers know that in a system in which justice is absent, Liu’s efforts to speak to a higher moral calling requires only moral courage to be followed.
The regime has tried to separate politics and economics, but Liu has shown that this is impossible.
Any Chinese can become another Liu Xiaobo if they choose to see through the lies of the regime’s “Materialism/Leninism.”
But even here there is a paradox for the regime.
For inevitably, the ordinary men and women who have built modern China will demand to live in a freedom commensurate to their material achievements.
So a civilized China is emerging, just as a civilized Eastern Europe once emerged, from the hearts and minds of prisoners of conscience, of people like Liu Xiaobo.
Havel, who has inspired Liu as he has so many others who aspire to freedom, wrote a public letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao after Liu’s latest imprisonment.
In it, he said: “Mr. Liu's trial was the result of a political order for which you carry ultimate political responsibility.”
Just as Czechoslovakia’s communist government once imprisoned Havel for daring to dream of a civil society and a true constitution of liberty for his country, China’s government has imprisoned Liu for attempting something similar, with his Charter 08 appeal, modeled on Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77.
Havel eventually saw his ideas triumph in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.
Liu Xiaobo is demonstrating anew the unstoppable power of the powerless.
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize lifts the hopes of all of us who dream of a truly free and civilized China.
And we might also dream that next December, the Nobel committee will at long last recognize Havel for an award whose meaning he truly personifies.
A Very Tolerant Christmas
LONDON – Christmas is coming – and has been, it seems, since mid-autumn.
And just in case there was any sign of flagging, we now have Black Friday, an export from the United States, when we are all encouraged to drink deep of the modern Christmas spirit and shop until we drop.
In my old-fashioned way, I rather disapprove of celebrating “God rest you merry merchants” day.
Since when were we happy for Christmas to dawn in early November?
Festivals should happen only when they turn up on the calendar.
When I was a boy, Christmas arrived on its eve, December 24.
We went to mass at midnight.
Afterward, my dad carried me home.
We woke up the following morning to open presents and prepare for our turkey lunch.
The day after Christmas was a public holiday with cold turkey and ham to sustain us.
Then it was back to work on December 27.
That was that. Christmas was over, until December 24 the following year.
These days, whether you are Christian or not, the feast to mark the birth of Jesus Christ has turned into a winter bacchanal and a huge retailing orgy.
Of course, there was always a commercial side to Christmas, if only for breeders of poultry and makers of greeting cards.
But in most countries today, even those with few Christian citizens, the festival offers the chance for a holiday and a binge.
Sometimes, the symbols of the event become very confused.
It is reported that one Tokyo department store marked the time of year for shoppers by hanging a huge crucified Father Christmas in its entrance hall.
Apocryphal or not, the story gives us some idea of the cultural confusion that this midwinter religious feast can cause.
It is all a long way from the stable in Bethlehem that we read about in the New Testament – a location now ringed by Israel Defense Forces barbed wire.
Of course, there are places where any sign of celebrating Christmas would trigger immediate persecution.
In any part of Mesopotamia presently controlled by the Islamic State (ISIS), practicing Christians would lose their heads.
At its worst, intolerance is literally murderous.
But there are other forms of intolerance, infinitely less horrifying than that of jihadist bigots, that kill no one but demean us all.
Think of all those who don’t like to write or say “Happy Christmas,” lest they offend those who are not Christians.
This self-censorship is rather insulting to Jews, Hindus, and Muslims.
What cause for offense should they have when Christians celebrate their December feast?
Does the celebration of Diwali, Eid, or Passover offend Christians?
It certainly should not, although we can recall terrible periods of Christian intolerance and bigotry.
In Britain, we recently experienced an example of alleged political correctness that went well beyond such questions.
The Church of England filmed various Christian groups saying the Lord’s Prayer, one of the foundations of Christian worship.
The film was to be shown among the advertisements in cinemas.
But the cinema proprietors banned the film on the grounds that it might give offense.
Even well-known atheists criticized this mindless act of censorship.
Intolerance grows, and not just in societies run by jihadists and religious fanatics.
Across university campuses, particularly in the US but also in Britain, students claim the right to deny others free speech or to rewrite history that offends them – a complete denial of what universities should be all about.
Censorship and assertions of sensitivity eviscerate scholarship and, with it, the very idea of a university where pluralism defines the meeting of minds.
Disagreement is the heart of educated debate.
Destroy that and you destroy the hallmarks of liberal order.
As the great political philosopher Karl Popper argued, the only thing that we should not tolerate in an open society is intolerance.
The most extreme example of such intolerance today – which much of the world is now fighting – is the religious totalitarianism of ISIS.
The extent to which this extremism is a product of Saudi Arabia’s energetic promotion of its Wahhabi ideology is for Muslims to debate themselves.
But it is increasingly difficult for the outside world to overlook the impact of the Kingdom’s main export, alongside oil.
The best present we could give to the world this Christmas (regardless of whether we celebrate it religiously or not), would be to dedicate ourselves to championing tolerance everywhere.
This will require us to address the inverted narratives of victimhood, which are often recruited to justify intolerance.
The suffering from past wrongs does not justify current and future cruelty.
This Christmas, the open society is endangered not only from without, by the likes of ISIS, but also by (admittedly far smaller) threats at home – a gloomy reflection, I admit, as we prepare in churches and in high streets to enjoy another year’s winter party.
So, in the spirit of tolerance: Happy Christmas, whether you are Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, atheist, agnostic, consumerist, or Christian.
As the Irish comedian Dave Allen used to say, “May your God go with you.”
Into Syria without Arms
NEW YORK – Much of the debate over what to do in the Middle East tends to pit realists against idealists.
Bahrain is a classic case, as is Saudi Arabia and, for that matter, Egypt: calls for the United States and other countries with interests and influence in the region to stand up for democracy and human rights run up against concerns that national-security interests will suffer if pro-Western authoritarian regimes are ousted.
European and US policymakers often attempt to square the circle with a compromise policy that is inconsistent and satisfies no one.
Syria offers a stark contrast to this pattern in the sense that strategic and humanitarian interests are aligned.
Many governments have a strategic desire to oust a regime that is closely allied with Iran and Hezbollah.
And there is a humanitarian desire to get rid of a regime that has killed as many as 15,000 – if not more – of its own people.
But an armed intervention would be a large undertaking, one requiring not just considerable air power (given Syria’s extensive air-defense network) but also ground forces, given the existence of at least two capable divisions that remain loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
The sectarian nature of Syrian society all but guarantees that the presence of troops from other countries would be both prolonged and difficult.
One alternative to direct military intervention is to provide arms and other forms of support to the opposition.
This is being done.
The case for helping people defend themselves is obvious.
But arming the opposition is not without its drawbacks. It risks fueling a civil war and encouraging regime loyalists to dig in.
In addition, arms provided to fight the regime will be used by factions to fight one another if and when the regime is removed, thereby making the aftermath in Syria that much more violent.
But intervention need not be defined as either armed intervention or intervention with arms.
There is much more that the world can and should be doing to bring about the removal of the Assad regime.
For starters, economic sanctions can be increased.
The rule of thumb should be that Syria will be the target of sanctions no less stringent than those being applied to Iran.
Syria’s energy and banking sectors should be fully covered.
The elites in Syria who still support the regime ought to pay an additional price.
Cutting off air travel to and from Syria would increase dissatisfaction among those who regularly visit London, Paris, and other Western capitals.
Likewise, those Arab governments unhappy with the state of affairs in Syria can do more to bring about change.
They could suspend all ties with Syria, and they should scale back commercial and diplomatic relations with Russia, the regime’s most important external backer, until the Kremlin alters its policy.
Moreover, the diplomatic mission led by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan under UN auspices needs to be fundamentally recast.
The time to try to broker a compromise, with Assad’s regime agreeing to reforms that would satisfy the opposition, is long gone (if it ever existed).
The purpose of diplomacy now should be to bring about an exit for Assad and his inner circle, and to establish a process for moving to a new, more representative political order based on the rule of law.
We are already beginning to see some of those closest to Assad desert what they rightly view as a sinking ship.
One way to accelerate this trend is to threaten war-crimes indictments by a certain date, say, August 15, for any senior official who remains a part of the government and is associated with its campaign against the Syrian people.
Naming these individuals would concentrate minds in Damascus.
Defections will also increase if the Syrian opposition demonstrates that the alternative to the Assad regime is one that is truly open and inclusive.
The minority Alawites fear that they will suffer the fate of the minority Sunnis in post-Saddam Iraq. The only way to reassure them (and to encourage them to defect) is with an opposition that becomes truly national and articulates principles that appeal to all Syrians.
Western governments need to work much more closely with the divided and relatively inexperienced opposition if this imperative is to be met.
In short, the crisis in Syria warrants outside intervention, but mostly with tools other than arms.
What is needed is an approach that hastens the demise of the Assad regime and increases the odds that what comes after will not be an orgy of vengeance, violence, and chaos.
The human and strategic stakes call for no less.
Investing in a Closed-Border World
CAMBRIDGE – Investors, like astronomers or anthropologists, rely on intellectual models to make sense of a complicated universe, guide immediate choices, and set priorities for further inquiry. But, every so often, a freak occurrence forces a reappraisal of what we think we know.
It could be a strange fossil. Or it could be a political upheaval, like the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom or the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
As a tumultuous year comes to a close, giddy global markets continue to set new records.
But investors should not become distracted.
In 2017, they will need to reappraise how the global economy works, and recalibrate accordingly their assessment of every stock or bond on sale, because even if some market fundamentals remain the same, many others have clearly changed.
For at least two decades, most investors accepted the consensus among economists and political scientists that the world was getting smaller and more integrated.
With the rise of China and India, one-third of the world’s population suddenly became workers and consumers in the global economy.
And new technologies offered cheap communications, advanced robotics, and increasingly powerful data analysis, which enabled companies to slim down their inventories and integrate supply chains.
Meanwhile, political leaders gradually developed regulatory and trade regimes that eliminated tariffs, simplified border crossings, and opened exciting new markets.
Good companies tried to take advantage of new opportunities, and investors looked for the firms that showed the most promise.
According to the World Trade Organization, merchandise and commercial-services exports have quadrupled since 1995.
Given this track record, when trade performance declined after the 2008 financial crisis, most policymakers assumed that new trade agreements would, again, boost growth.
US President Barack Obama’s administration, for its part, envisioned a vast free-trade area encompassing both Asia and Europe.
The two grand agreements that it pursued – the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – would have put the US at the center of an integrated market comprising two-thirds of the global economy.
But that hope has faded now that populist movements across the West, tapping into public discontent about the dawning world order, have succeeded at the polls.
Since the radical anti-establishment Syriza’s election in Greece almost two years ago, voters seem to have taken to the idea of national governments standing up to supranational and multilateral organizations such the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.
Likewise, many observers have interpreted the Brexit referendum as a bid to reassert control over national borders.
And while historians will still be debating what led to Trump’s victory long after he has left office, it is already apparent that many of his supporters similarly want America to bolt its door, restock its pantry, and rely more on itself than on foreign friends.
Taken together, these political outcomes – and the anti-establishment forces on the march ahead of next year’s French and German elections – will halt further global economic and political integration, at least in the near term.
For now, countries will avoid grand trade deals and make only half-hearted efforts to align their regulations.
Companies operating internationally will soon face higher costs, as it becomes harder to move goods across state borders and employ foreign workers; their investors, meanwhile, can expect lower returns.
Even a mild trade tussle between the US and Mexico, for example, could be extremely costly for car manufacturers, given that some components currently cross the US border as many as eight times during the production process.
And if Boeing were not already reining in its Dreamliner model’s vast global supply chain, it would now be scrambling to do so even faster.
If voters want to limit the cross-border movement of goods, services, and people, companies will have to adopt a new model that builds in more redundancy within borders; and investors will need to look for firms that can profit with minimal border crossings, or that can still generate a profit despite increased protectionist friction.
At the margin, the market will put a premium on companies that can quibble with governments and navigate contradictory regulations, rather than those that can boost productivity and open new markets.
At the same time, the new model that emerges will still have to account for major forces that sustained the old model, especially the forces of globalization and technological innovation that voter resistance will not stop.
In today’s global economy, the next substantial productivity boost will come from companies analyzing customer and production-line data on a large scale.
Companies that do this well will be able to design better products, at lower costs; but they will achieve significant gains only if they can compare data across borders and jurisdictions.
Meanwhile, the immutable logic of the Internet, productivity-enhancing robotics, and the division of labor that Adam Smith first described will force governments to cooperate.
Savvy investors will look for companies that can withstand the current populist revolt against globalization and take advantage of incipient economic and technological trends.
Theirs will be a more complicated analysis for more complicated times.
Like a good astronomer or anthropologist, however, successful investors will find reliable patterns in a sea of crosscutting evidence.
Inviting the Avoidable
Maybe it is excessive skittishness, or perhaps it is the result of global financial volatility in recent years – crises in Mexico in 1994-5, East Asia in 1997-98, Russia in 1998, and then in Brazil, Turkey, and Argentina – but we economists are more concerned about monetary affairs and possible future disasters than we have been in many decades.
This month, the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was the latest to worry aloud about the financial risks that the world seems to be building into its future.
“[A]ll the countries hit by financial crisis... experience[d] a very sharp slowdown,” the BIS says of the recent past.
It then cites “global current account imbalances,” particularly “the US external deficit,” describing it as “unprecedented for a reserve currency country to have a current account deficit of such magnitude.”
In short, the world has become “increasingly prone to financial turbulence.”
The BIS hints at the possibility of a financial crisis that, with the US at its center, would dwarf by at least an order of magnitude all crises that have occurred since 1933.
Yet, in response to this risk, the BIS issues the standard textbook recommendations.
Countries whose policies and economies are out of balance should change their policies, thereby restoring balance: “deficit countries should reduce the rate of growth of domestic spending below that of domestic production.
Allowing their currencies to depreciate in real terms would make their products more competitive, and also provide an incentive for production to shift out of non-tradables into tradables.”
This is economists’ polite code for the message that the US must gradually cut its budget deficit, while other countries – like China and Japan – must gradually let the value of the dollar fall and that of their own currencies rise.
So the BIS proposes nothing new or particularly attention-grabbing.
But if we turn to America’s government, we see an enormous pretense that the current budget deficit is not a problem.
As Stan Collender, a noted observer of the US federal budget, has commented, “No one with federal budget responsibilities actually seems to be interested in the budget.”
This is not “because the budget committees are too busy....[T]he House and Senate...are not doing much of anything...[because] they don't want to.”
Within the Bush administration, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Josh Bolten “has been virtually invisible,” while “the president and vice president...avoid talking publicly about the budget.”
Let us be clear on this point: it is not that politicians who wish to take the lead on fiscal consolidation are failing to gain traction; it is that there are no politicians – at least none with any agenda-setting influence – who are even trying to steer the US towards adopting a more responsible fiscal policy.
This is a grotesque failure of leadership.
Governments that pursue policies – whether US fiscal laxity or China’s exchange-rate peg – that create unsustainable imbalances do so for what they regard as important political reasons.
Appeals to them to change their policies, and thus contribute to the common global good of financial stability, are fruitless unless others are seen to change their policies, act responsibly, and so contribute to the common good as well.
International policy coordination requires a leader, a first mover.
But, while the US, as the world’s largest economy, is best suited for this role, it has so far failed to play its part.
Treasury Secretary John Snow has spent almost no public time on the budget, but a lot of public time on China.
Republican political operatives care far less about national savings than they do about manufacturing-sector job losses.
“So what else is new?” you may ask – and with good reason.
The list of issues on which the Bush administration has failed to lead is a long one, and failure to take steps to diminish the risks of future financial catastrophe cannot rank very high.
The entire Bush administration has been a succession of leadership failures, so why harp on its poor financial management?
Form a purely practical point of view, one reason is that ensuring global financial stability is an issue on which real progress can be made relatively easily.
The Bush administration may not care that deficit reduction is the right policy for America, but it might care far more if the issue were framed as a prerequisite for policy changes abroad that diminish pressure from imports on domestic manufacturing employment.
Iran: Another Problem from Hell
WASHINGTON, DC – Throughout 2010, the pattern for negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program held to form.
With just about every diplomatic effort failing to yield results, international efforts have increasingly given way to discussions about sanctions – and what mix of them would be needed to bring Iran to heel.
In 2011, a renewed focus on comprehensive economic sanctions could turn out to be the bad idea whose time has arrived.
Sanctions, of course, have a dismal historical record in achieving their aims.
Indeed, they have often been more useful in proving the law of unintended consequences.
So it might be useful to step back and take one more look at our disagreeable negotiating partner – Iran – to see what should, and should not, be emphasized diplomatically.
There is nothing easy about negotiating with Iran.
It is one of the oldest states in the broader Middle East, with a deep culture.
Despite its leaders’ grim public image, Iran has a sense of humanism, as any Kurd who fled from Saddam Hussein’s chemical-warfare attacks along the Iranian border can attest.
Bending, much less breaking, will not come naturally to such a prideful country.
Iran also doesn’t “play well with others.”
Most Americans remember it as the country that abducted US diplomats soon after its Islamic revolution in 1979, holding them for no apparent purpose for 444 days.
No American diplomat has been stationed in Tehran since.
American attitudes toward Iran are probably far more conditioned by that episode than people realize.
Iran is also internally divided.
Its mullahs bicker constantly, seeming to reflect the country’s broader cleavages.
Iran’s civilian authorities apparently have limited control over the military and the dreaded security services, which seem to answer to no one but themselves.
Iran’s Islamic Revolution, moreover, has run into a familiar contradiction: it cannot further its aims without accepting Westernization and modernization.
Iran’s youthful population – a product of the massive post-revolution baby boom – is increasingly frustrated and depressed; not surprisingly, young Iranians are having fewer children than ever.
As the June 2009 election protests showed, Iran’s urban youth desperately want to end the country’s isolation, but they have increasingly found that the only way out of isolation is to study or work abroad – and never return.
Iran does not live in a great neighborhood, either.
Turkey can be a good neighbor, but otherwise Iran is bordered by inhospitable states to the east and the north.
And, while its western neighbor Iraq is a fellow Shia-majority state, Iraq’s Arab Shia make no secret of their distaste for the Persians and their claim to Shia prominence.
While most of the world may have missed it, there is an ongoing competition between Iraq’s Najaf and Iran’s Qom over which city is holier.
Iran has virtually no friends among the Sunni Arab states.
As the world recently learned from the WikiLeaks release of US diplomatic cables, Sunni Arab leaders are no more tolerant of an Iranian nuclear bomb than is the US or its allies.
The Sunni reaction to Iran may reflect deep-seated suspicions about the Shia (witness the cold shoulder given by most Sunnis to Shia rule in Iraq).
Iran’s only friends, it seems, are those – like the Chinese – who are more interested in its natural resources than its people.
While sanctions may deepen Iran’s predicament, they are unlikely to break the diplomatic impasse on nuclear weapons.
But, given the Iranian government’s increasingly unhelpful reactions to diplomatic overtures, there is unlikely to be any interest in toning down sanctions.
Indeed, just the opposite response is likely – efforts to tighten sanctions still further. 
Yet, just as the US adopted a “bomb and talk” approach with the Serbs during the dénouement of the Bosnian war, America must be willing to “sanction and talk” when it comes to Iran, thereby creating greater space for an eventual diplomatic strategy.
First, the US should consider establishing diplomatic relations with Iran and putting diplomats on the ground.
This would not be an easy process, and could well meet considerable Iranian resistance.
But the Iranians have diplomatic relations with other members of its main interlocutor in talks on its nuclear program, the sanctions-minded P-5+1 Group (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US), and restoring Iran-US diplomatic ties would shorten lines of communications and close the 444-day chapter of 1979-1981.
Second, even if a stronger bilateral mechanism is forged, it should not be allowed to displace the P-5 approach.
The ability of this group to work together is critical to resolving this and future crises. 
Third, the US should continue its efforts to encourage action by Iran’s neighbors.
While Turkey’s lurch into the fray in 2010 may have been unwelcome, its interest in calming a situation involving an immediate neighbor is understandable.
More problematically, the Sunni Arab states should also give more serious thought to addressing the situation, and should seek to reconcile their private and public postures.
Iran, after all, is not building an Islamic bomb.
It is building an Iranian bomb, or, worse yet, a Shia bomb that Arab leaders must be more resolute in trying to stop.
Private expressions of deep concern do not compensate for public nonchalance (or changing the topic to Israel), and are hardly a basis for a successful policy toward a country whose nuclear ambitions could have a catastrophic impact on the region.
Finally, the Chinese and the Russians have been brought along principally by the US to a more robust policy, yet they remain reluctant.
They need to convey through their own bilateral approaches to Iran a sense of urgency – and perhaps even express a little anger – at Iran’s unwillingness to negotiate seriously.
Sanctions should be a tool of diplomacy, not the other way around.
Even as we look to tighten sanctions on Iran in 2011, we must strengthen our efforts to establish a strong political and diplomatic track.
Iran at History’s Fork in the Road
NEW YORK – History rarely unfolds smoothly or evenly. Instead, it tends to be punctuated by major developments – battles, assassinations, breakthroughs – that have consequences that are felt for years.
Thirty-one years after the revolution that ousted the Shah and brought Islamic rule to Iran, we are at one of those turning points.
To be sure, we do not know the degree, direction, or pace of change.
What we do know, however, is that what happens in Iran will materially affect not just that country but the entire Middle East and beyond.
One future for Iran would be mostly an extension of what already exists, i.e., an Iran run by conservative clerics and an aggressive Revolutionary Guard, with the latter increasingly enjoying the upper hand.
The Iranian regime would continue to brutally repress its domestic opponents, meddle in Iraq and Afghanistan, arm and fund Hezbollah and Hamas, and, most important, develop the ability to construct one or more nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.
The emergence of such a future would present the world with a stark choice: either acquiesce to an Iran that possesses or could quickly assemble a nuclear device, or launch a preventive military attack designed to destroy much of the Iranian nuclear program.
Iran’s emergence as a nuclear-weapons state would almost certainly tempt several of the main Sunni Muslim countries (Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia all come to mind) to embark on a crash program to acquire or develop nuclear arms of their own.
A Middle East comprising several nuclear weapons states is a recipe for catastrophe.
An armed attack by the United States, Israel, or both on Iran’s nuclear facilities is another possibility.
One downside of such a prospect that Iran would likely retaliate against US interests and personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, using Hamas and Hezbollah, against Israel and others.
Iran could also interfere with oil traffic, leading to a spike in prices and delivering a further blow to American and global economic recovery.
Moreover, while a preventive strike would delay Iran’s nuclear efforts, it would not stop the regime from rebuilding, and it might also create conditions that cause problems for the regime’s domestic opponents.
But, despite these potential drawbacks, an armed attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities will and should remain a distinct possibility given the enormous strategic costs of a nuclear-armed Iran.
It is in part to avoid the difficult choice of either living with a nuclear-armed Iran or attacking it that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany have pursued negotiations to limit Iran’s nuclear program and place it under international supervision.
Russia and China, which claim to oppose the emergence of a nuclear-armed Iran, are now being pressed to support new, tough sanctions to increase the odds it does not happen.
But if history is a guide, even strong sanctions may not be enough to persuade Iran’s rulers to negotiate constructively and accept meaningful constraints on their nuclear activities.
These considerations raise the prospect of trying to bring about an alternative future: an Iran with a political leadership that is more moderate at home and abroad, and that forgoes developing a nuclear weapon or anything close to it.
In addition to providing a better life for Iran’s 70 million people, political change there would weaken both Hamas and Hezbollah, thereby strengthening the relative position of moderates in the West Bank and Gaza and much improving the prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
A more moderate Iran would also cause Turkey to reconsider its recent shift away from the West and lead Syria to rethink its foreign-policy orientation, which would create a real opportunity for an Israeli peace deal with Damascus.
Iraq’s prospects for emerging as a successful country at peace with itself and its neighbors also would be much improved.
It is rare in history that such widely different but plausible paths stem from a common point.
It is not difficult, however, to determine which one is preferable.
This is why additional measures are called for to improve the prospects for political change that brings about an Iranian government prepared to live in peace with its own people and its neighbors.
Such measures include assisting the Green Movement so that it can maintain access to the Internet, introducing additional sanctions aimed at the Revolutionary Guard, and publicly supporting the political and legal rights of the Iranian people.
Some governments and individuals are likely to resist these suggestions, believing that such intervention constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into Iran’s sovereignty.
But in today’s global world, what happens in Iran is more than Iran’s affair.
Iran’s government has a right to nuclear power to generate electricity, but not to a nuclear weapon.
It also has obligations to its neighbors, to the world community (not to support terrorism, for example), and to its citizens.
The world should not sit idly by as Iran’s regime fails to meet these obligations.
Iran Confronts Reality
MADRID – Who has not seen what looks like water on a highway on a hot summer’s day?
Or a three-dimensional image that was actually a picture on a flat surface?
The nature of illusion is that we mistake what we perceive for reality.
That is true whether an illusion is cognitive or political.
Depending on how a particular event develops, it can lead us to formulate erroneous interpretations of what is actually happening.
Such perceptions are often mediated by ideas and previous experiences.
And, as Robert Jervis argued in Perception and Misperception in International Politics, published during the Cold War, the illusions that we create have an enormous influence on decision-making – even becoming a fundamental cause of conflict.
To a certain extent, this is what has happened with analysis of the recent 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), held at the end of August in Tehran – the first time Iran has hosted the meeting.
The summit took place against a background of scant progress in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program and growing pressure from Israel for the international community to establish a “trigger” – a line that the Islamic Republic must not cross.
Moreover, regional tensions heightened the perception of the NAM summit’s importance and that of its host.
In the Middle East, only Iran and Hezbollah support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in a civil war that is nearing the point of no return and destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan.
The NAM played an important role during the Cold War.
Its vision was shaped by the recent independence struggles of many of its member countries, and its agenda promoted national sovereignty, non-interference, a rebalancing of North-South relations, and support for national liberation movements.
But the reality that united NAM in the past has changed.
The Cold War’s bipolar governance structures and a subsequent period of American unilateralism – to which the non-aligned states attempted to act as a counterbalance – have given way to a much more complex and interdependent multi-polar world.
While the United States and Europe are still struggling to overcome a serious economic crisis, many NAM members, such as India, Chile, and Singapore, have maintained relative strong growth and form a part of new global governance structures, such as the G-20.
Likewise, many of the problems that we now face – whether climate change, financial crisis, development challenges, terrorism, or nuclear proliferation – reflect growing global interdependence.
Managing them effectively obliges us to rethink the concept of sovereignty.
These changes have transformed not only the traditional structures of power, but also the leitmotif of NAM and the fate of its members.
Globalization has fueled ever-widening disparities among its members – just compare Colombia with Afghanistan, or Chile with Sudan – that make it difficult to transform sheer numbers into coherent influence.
The impact of the Tehran summit, and whom it may have benefited, is not entirely clear.
Iran certainly regarded the meeting as a propaganda opportunity, promising wide media coverage at a time when it was in the eye of a diplomatic hurricane.
But the participants’ inability to reach a common position on their hosts’ nuclear program or the violence in Syria – two of the fundamental questions that confronted the summit – obviously undermined Iran’s effort to demonstrate that, despite facing severe economic and diplomatic sanctions, it remains an effective international player.
Indeed, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Iran for not assuring the world that it is not seeking nuclear arms at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency has published a new report suggesting that it is.
And, in a speech of great depth, Mohamed Morsi, the first Egyptian president to visit Iran since the Islamic Republic’s birth in 1979, firmly rejected the Syrian regime, as he did in a subsequent appearance before the Arab League as well.
Moreover, Morsi urged Iran to join Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia – all Sunni-majority countries – in pressing for political transition in Syria (a role that the Syrian opposition rejected before Iran could even say no).
In other words, reality betrayed the perception that Iran sought to create in hosting the NAM summit.
Instead, Morsi’s speech provided the occasion’s most memorable moment.
And Iran’s nuclear quest remains a reality that must not be ignored during the next key three years, when the Islamic Republic will lead NAM while itself remaining one of the most serious problems on the international agenda.
An Iran Deal Ten Years Late
ROME – The only thing to lament about the agreement reached by Iran and the P5+1 (the UN Security Council’s five permanent members – China, Britain, France, Russia, and the United States – plus Germany) in Vienna this month is that it was not signed and sealed a decade ago.
In the years that it has taken for diplomatic sanity to prevail, the Middle East has endured myriad avoidable tensions and lost opportunities for security cooperation.
From 2003 to 2006, Iran made clear to anyone willing to listen that it would agree to all the key elements of the recent deal, including measures to block uranium and plutonium pathways to a bomb and obtrusive monitoring mechanisms to ensure ample advance notice of a likely breakout.
All it needed in return – beyond, of course, the lifting of sanctions as implementation proceeded – was formal recognition of its “right to enrich” uranium.
In discussions with the European Union in 2003-2004, Iran voluntarily froze its then-minimal enrichment program, pending negotiation of a full accord.
Iran also declared its willingness to apply the “additional protocol,” allowing for much more far-reaching and stringent monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency than is called for under standard arrangements.
Those commitments ended in 2005, owing to the continued insistence by the EU, backed by the US, that Iran abandon uranium enrichment entirely.
This stance disregarded the “inalienable right,” clearly acknowledged in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as much as one might wish otherwise, in an ideal world), of NPT parties to engage in all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle as part of a peaceful nuclear energy program.
If, at that time, the West had been prepared to settle for effectively containing Iran’s nuclear program, rather than destroying every last sensitive component of it, a deal would have been possible.
And, indeed, in early 2006, the International Crisis Group published a comprehensive “delayed limited enrichment” proposal that included all of the key features of the deal that has now been signed in Vienna.
I am confident, on the basis of many hours of productive dialogue with senior Iranian officials in Tehran, New York, and elsewhere, that this proposal could have broken the deadlock.
It had all the right elements of an effective compromise.
But with the US not talking to Iran at any level, and the EU talking but not listening, the effort went nowhere.
The Iranians were never going to accept what they perceived as second-class status under the NPT.
It was only when US President Barack Obama’s administration acknowledged that, and commenced direct back-channel talks in 2011, that progress became possible.
The key was the recognition that Iran’s sense of honor had to be accommodated.
Critics of the Vienna deal in the US Congress, Israel, and the Arab world tend to assume that Iran has no honor.
They believe that Iran has always been hell-bent on building nuclear weapons, and that its leaders signed the deal, which imposes limits on the country’s nuclear program for 15 years, only to relieve the enormous sanctions pressure now crushing its economy.
Iran is biding its time, the critics charge, and will inevitably attempt to break out again.
While no one should be under any illusion that Iran has been a model international citizen, or is likely to become one any time soon, this perception of the country’s nuclear ambitions involves a fundamental misreading of the dynamics in play.
My judgment, based on more dialogue with senior Iranian officials than most of the critics have conducted, is that Iran – whatever engineering research it may have carried out in the past, and whatever fuel-making and missile-delivery capabilities it may have developed more recently – has never been close to deciding actually to build nuclear weapons.
Iran has always been keenly aware of the multiple risks involved in crossing that red line.
It knows that it would face attack by a much more heavily armed Israel, whether supported by the US or not; that Sunni powers in the region could move quickly to counter a “Shia bomb” with their own nuclear weapons; and that additional crushing international sanctions could be imposed.
And there is another factor that should not be instantly dismissed, as it usually is by cynical critics: Iranian leaders’ repeated strong rejection of weapons of mass destruction on religious grounds.
The question, then, is why has Iran walked the precipice for so long by building a visible breakout capability bound to spook the West, Israel, and its Arab neighbors?
The answer, I believe, is overwhelmingly national pride – its peoples’ desire to demonstrate that Iran is a power to be reckoned with, a country that has impressive technical prowess, and that there are limits to its willingness to suffer international humiliation.
Iranians vividly remember the overthrow, orchestrated by the CIA and British intelligence, of the elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953.
They remember the West’s prolonged support for the hated Shah, and for Iraq in its brutal war with Iran in the 1980s, even after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein employed chemical weapons.
And they remember when US President George W. Bush labeled their country part of an “axis of evil,” despite its cooperation with the US in Afghanistan.
It is understandable that many will not readily be persuaded of Iranian sincerity, not least because the national negotiating style – among moderates and hardliners alike – tends to be anything but frank and direct, with private reason often accompanied by public thunder that makes it hard to assess real intent.
But the Vienna agreement deserves wide support, and not just because the alternatives – continuation of acute regional tension at best, and catastrophic military conflict at worst – are so unappealing.
In fact, there is every reason to believe that the agreement captures and reflects the real interests not just of Iran, but also of the international community.
It keeps intact a global non-proliferation regime that has been showing signs of falling apart, and gives new hope for wider regional security cooperation.
Intelligent diplomacy beats brute force every time.
Saying No to the Warmongers
NEW YORK – The accord struck in Vienna to rein in Iran’s nuclear activities has warmongers fulminating.
Citizens worldwide should support US President Barack Obama’s brave effort to outmaneuver them, taking heart from the fact that the signatories include not just the United States, but all five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany.
Many of the warmongers are to be found in Obama’s own government agencies.
Most Americans struggle to recognize or understand their country’s permanent security state, in which elected politicians seem to run the show, but the CIA and the Pentagon often take the lead – a state that inherently gravitates toward military, rather than diplomatic, solutions to foreign-policy challenges.
Since 1947, when the CIA was established, the US has had a continuous semi-covert, semi-overt policy of overthrowing foreign governments.
In fact, the CIA was designed to avoid genuine democratic oversight and provide presidents with “plausible deniability.”
It has gone on to topple dozens of governments, in all regions of the world, with no accountability there or at home.
I recently examined one period of CIA activity in my book To Move the World: JFK’s Quest for Peace.
Soon after Kennedy assumed the presidency in 1961, he was “informed” by the CIA of its plot to overthrow Fidel Castro.
Kennedy felt stuck: Should he sanction the planned CIA invasion of Cuba or veto it?
New to the gruesome game, Kennedy tried to have it both ways, by letting it proceed, but without US air cover.
The CIA-led invasion, executed by a motley group of Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, was a military failure and a foreign-policy disaster, one that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis the following year.
During the missile crisis, most senior security officials advising the president wanted to launch military action against Soviet forces, a course that could well have ended in nuclear annihilation.
Kennedy overruled the warmongers, and prevailed in the crisis through diplomacy.
By 1963, Kennedy no longer trusted the advice of the military and the CIA.
Indeed, he regarded many of his putative advisers as a threat to world peace.
That year, he used diplomacy relentlessly and skillfully to achieve a breakthrough nuclear agreement with the Soviet Union, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
The American people strongly – and rightly – supported Kennedy over the warmongers.
But three months after the treaty was signed, JFK was assassinated.
Viewed through the lens of history, the main job of US presidents is to be mature and wise enough to stand up to the permanent war machine.
Kennedy tried; his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did not, and the debacle of Vietnam ensued.
Jimmy Carter tried; Reagan did not (his CIA helped to unleash death and mayhem in Central America throughout the 1980s).
Clinton mostly tried (except in the Balkans); George W. Bush did not, and generated new wars and turmoil.
On the whole, Obama has tried to restrain the warmongers, yet he has given in to them frequently – not only by relying on weaponized drones, but also by waging covert wars in Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and elsewhere.
Nor did he truly end the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; he replaced troops on the ground with US drones, air strikes, and “private” contractors.
Iran is surely his finest moment, a historic milestone that demands full-throated approval.
The political difficulty of making peace with Iran is similar to that of JFK’s peacemaking with the Soviet Union in 1963.
Americans have been suspicious of Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent hostage crisis, in which Iranian students held 52 Americans at the US embassy for 444 days.
But their suspicion also reflects jingoistic manipulation and a lack of perspective on US-Iran relations.
Few Americans know that the CIA overthrew a democratic Iranian government in 1953.
Iranians had had the temerity to elect a progressive, secular prime minister who believed that the country’s oil belonged to its people, not to the United Kingdom or the US.
And few Americans recall that after the coup, the CIA installed a brutal police state under the Shah.
Likewise, following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the US armed Saddam Hussein’s Iraq to go to war with Iran, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Iranian deaths in the 1980s.
And US-led international sanctions, imposed from the 1990s onward, have aimed to impoverish, destabilize, and ultimately topple the Islamist regime.
Today, the warmongers are trying to scuttle the Vienna accord.
Saudi Arabia is in a violent struggle with Iran for regional supremacy, with geopolitical competition converging with the Sunni-Shia rivalry.
Israel, the Middle East’s only nuclear power, wants to retain its strategic monopoly.
The US warmongers seem to view any Islamist state as ripe for toppling.
Obama is correct that America’s true interests, and those of the world, are with peace, not continued conflict, with Iran.
The US is not a partisan in the Shia-Sunni struggle; if anything, the US confronts mainly Sunni terrorism, funded from Saudi Arabia, not Shia terrorism backed by Iran.
Obama is also right that, despite Israel’s arguments, the agreement will reduce the possibility of Iran ever becoming a nuclear state.
The best way to ensure that outcome is to normalize relations with it, help its economy recover, and support its integration into the international community.
Iran is a great and ancient culture.
Its opening to the world as a place of business, tourism, the arts, and sports would be a boon to global stability and prosperity.
The new treaty will verifiably prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for at least a decade – and keep it bound to nuclear non-proliferation thereafter.
This is the time to begin a broader US-Iran rapprochement and build a new security regime in the Middle East and the world that leads toward full global nuclear disarmament.
To get there requires, above all, replacing war (including the CIA’s secret wars) with commerce and other forms of peaceful exchange.
Iran’s Economy After the Elections
LONDON – Recent gains by pro-government reformist candidates in Iran’s parliamentary elections have given President Hassan Rouhani a welcome midterm boost.
But huge economic challenges remain.
And in the coming months, these challenges are what will determine the battle lines between the president and his hardline adversaries inside and outside the parliament.
Elections are normally won and lost along political lines, and Iran’s recent vote is no exception.
But, on this occasion, there is reason to believe that economic concerns were a major driver of political change, as evidenced by the massive turnout at the electoral booths.
Ever since July, when Iran signed a landmark nuclear deal with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union, popular expectations for an improvement in the state of the economy have reached a fever pitch.
Rouhani is well aware of the importance of economic expectations; indeed, they were what swept him into the presidency in 2013.
The recent election campaign once again drew strength from the promise to fix an economy battered by years of tough economic sanctions and domestic mismanagement.
That is why he placed a high priority on reaching a deal with the outside world that would close the nuclear file and pave the road to economic recovery.
The economy that Rouhani inherited from his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had been distorted by years of generous redistributions of oil revenues to the president’s supporters and then hit with stagflation, as what US Vice President Joe Biden called the “toughest economic sanctions in history” began to take hold.
In 2013, the year Rouhani assumed office, inflation exceeded 40%, and GDP contracted by 6%.
Rouhani’s woes were exacerbated by the economic destabilization that followed the introduction of comprehensive financial sanctions that cut Iran off from the international banking system.
Unable to sell oil, and faced with a blockade of the central bank by the United States and the EU, Rouhani faced the momentous challenge of trying to kick-start growth and tame spiraling prices.
Rouhani has had some success in lowering inflation, which is now down to 13%.
But rekindling growth has proven to be a tougher challenge.
With the International Monetary Fund predicting that GDP will either stagnate or contract this year, Iran’s economy might well be set for a double-dip recession.
With sanctions lifted, however, the IMF now expects GDP growth to reach roughly 5% next year – a rate that would make Iran the Middle East’s best-performing economy.
Attaining this level of growth will be essential if jobs are to be created; Iran habitually suffers from a double-digit unemployment rate, with official youth unemployment above 25%.
But several obstacles stand in the way.
The first is the collapse in oil prices, which have tumbled by 70% since mid-2014.
A similar misfortune occurred in 1999, when President Mohammad Khatami was attempting to carry out his own reformist experiment, and prices fell below $10 per barrel.
Then, as now, the first two years of a reformist administration were thwarted by adverse external developments in the international oil markets.
The last crisis was driven by demand-side factors relating to the Asian financial crisis.
This time, supply-side factors are creating a global oil glut, with similar results.
Failing to understand this, conspiracy theorists can be forgiven for noticing that reform-minded presidencies seem to be negatively correlated with international oil prices.
Rouhani’s main challenges, however, are internal.
They come from Iran’s complex post-revolutionary institutional architecture, which is beset by a labyrinth of decision-making entities interlaced with yet more bodies and agencies created to ensure compliance with Islamic tenets and revolutionary standards.
In recent decades, this system has produced tremendous political fragmentation, if not open factional fighting, at all levels.
It is in this labyrinth of power that Rouhani is fighting an intense battle with his conservative adversaries – a battle that may be far from over.
In fact, Rouhani’s economic remedies – attempting to open the economy to foreign trade and investment flows, and introducing economic reforms to foster the private sector following the lifting of sanctions – are at odds with the vision of Iran’s hardline conservatives.
For these so-called Principlists – who advocate a “resistance economy,” based on years of austerity marked by self-sufficiency and reliance on domestic resources – Rouhani’s desire to declare Iran “open for business” and to encourage foreigners to take an active role in Iran’s economy raises as much alarm as the nuclear deal.
The decline of the Principlists’ power bloc in the next parliament is undoubtedly a powerful message from Iran’s youthful electorate.
This resonates with what former US President Bill Clinton told Charlie Rose in 2005: Iran is the only country with elections “where the liberals, or the progressives, have won two-thirds to 70% of the vote in six elections….There is no other country in the world I can say that about, certainly not my own.”
A decade later, Clinton will no doubt find it heartening to see this trend continue.
But, while the Principlists might be down, they are certainly not out, as the looming battle over the future of the economy attests.
It is here that Rouhani will face his most difficult challenge.
His electoral victory might raise the stakes for him, by increasing pressure to deliver on popular expectations.
But, as reformists found when they lost to Ahmadinejad in 2005, growth and economic recovery cannot come at the expense of the electorate’s aspirations for greater equality and social justice.
The Drone in the Desert
TEL AVIV – A drone recently penetrated Israel’s airspace from the Mediterranean.
It was allowed to fly for about half an hour over southern Israel before being shot down by the Israeli air force over a sparsely populated area.
It is still not known who dispatched the drone and from where, but it is now assumed that it was launched from Lebanon, either by Hezbollah, acting in Iran's service, or by forces of the Iranian regime itself.
If that is indeed the case, the episode should not be regarded as yet another incident in a region fraught by conflict and violence.
On the contrary, it is a significant window into the arena in which the conflict over the future of Iran's nuclear program is being waged.
Several developments and forces are now shaping this arena.
One is Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s decision, announced in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, to suspend his threat to launch unilateral military action against Iran's nuclear installations.
He has said that Israel will give the US and the rest of the international community an opportunity to stop Iran’s progress through other means by the spring or early summer of 2013.
Another development is the US presidential election.
Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s success in the first debate improves his chances and the prospect of a new administration settling in before any major decisions are made on the Iranian nuclear issue.
In Iran, the regime pushes ahead, but is clearly being hurt by an economic crisis (largely a consequence of international sanctions), popular protest, and internal bickering –&nbsp;and has turned bellicose as a result.
After several months of listening to Israeli (and, to some extent, US) war rhetoric, the regime began issuing its own menacing bombast, as a matter of substance and to defend the pride of a regime that views itself as the heir to the glorious imperial tradition of Persia.
Various Iranian spokesmen have begun threatening Israel not only with a massive response to any potential attack, but also with a preemptive strike.
Israel would not merely be punished for any attack, they say; it would be annihilated.
This position was accompanied by Iran’s harder line on military involvement in the Syrian civil war, echoed by its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah.
For some time, under the impact of the Syrian civil war – and still smarting from the 2006 war with Israel – Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, had lowered his profile and moderated his rhetoric.
No longer.
At the same time, the Iranian regime is sending a variety of signals that it wants to renew the nuclear negotiations.
One example was the announcement that some of its enriched uranium is being diverted to medical research; in other words, uranium enrichment, according to this message, can be slowed down.
At this point, however, there are no indications that Iran is interested in more than reducing external pressure and the impact of the sanctions.
The drone, shot down not far from Israel’s nuclear facility in Dimona, fits with these two efforts.
Iran’s war rhetoric and threat to inflict a deadly blow on Israel is served by dispatching a drone in the general direction of Dimona.
And, if the idea is to negotiate, the drone’s flight was an excellent prelude to a demand that Iran’s nuclear effort be dealt with as part of a larger effort to ban nuclear weapons throughout the Middle East.
There are two other disturbing aspects to the drone affair.
First, it is a clear indication that Hezbollah is, indeed, the long arm of the Iranian regime – its base on the Mediterranean and on Israel’s border.
The occasional argument that it is a genuine Lebanese political movement, tied to Iran but ultimately Lebanese, is simply wrong.
Second, the drone’s arrival from the Mediterranean underscored the danger that terrorist organizations, supplied with deadly modern equipment, can inflict damage “without a return address.”
Just a few weeks ago, it was feared that Syria’s crumbling regime might transfer part of its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to Hezbollah, or that some of that arsenal might fall into jihadis’ hands.
And one of the arguments against Iran’s nuclear program has been that the regime might transfer fissile material to Hezbollah and its ilk to be used in a radioactive “dirty bomb.”
There are four components to an effective strategy for dealing with&nbsp;Iran’s nuclear program: real negotiations, rather than a leisurely meeting once every few weeks; stiff sanctions on Iran, but without today’s gaping loopholes; a credible threat of military action; and a face-saving exit for the Iranian leadership.
This is a viable strategy, but it is now clear that only the US can implement it.
Let us hope that the Americans act in time.
Iran: Last Exit for Diplomacy
The Iran crisis is moving fast in an alarming direction.
There can no longer be any reasonable doubt that Iran’s ambition is to obtain nuclear weapons capability.
However, at the heart of the issue lies the Iranian regime’s aspiration to become a hegemonic Islamic and regional power and thereby position itself at eye level with the world’s most powerful nations.
It is precisely this ambition that sets Iran apart from North Korea: whereas North Korea seeks nuclear weapons capability in order to entrench its own isolation, Iran is aiming for regional dominance and more.
Iran is betting on revolutionary changes within the power structure of the Middle East to help it achieve its strategic goal.
To this end, it makes use of Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also of Lebanon, Syria, its influence in the Gulf region, and, above all, Iraq.
This combination of hegemonic aspirations, questioning of the regional status quo, and a nuclear program is extremely dangerous.
Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear bomb – or even its ability to produce one – would be interpreted by Israel as fundamental threat to its existence, thereby compelling the West, and Europe in particular, to take sides.
Europe has not only historical moral obligations to Israel, but also security interests that link it to the strategically vital Eastern Mediterranean.
Moreover, a nuclear Iran would also be perceived as a threat by its other neighbors, which would likely provoke a regional arms race and further fuel regional volatility.
In short, nuclear Iran would call Europe’s fundamental security into question.
To believe that Europe could keep out of this conflict is a dangerous illusion.
In this crisis, the stakes are high, which is why Germany, the UK, and France began negotiations with Iran two years ago with the goal of persuading Iran to abandon its efforts to close the nuclear fuel cycle.
This initiative failed for two reasons.
First, the European offer to open up technology and trade, including the peaceful use of nuclear technology, was disproportionate to Iran’s fundamental fear of regime change on the one hand, and its regional hegemonic aspirations and quest for global prestige on the other.
Second, the disastrous US-led war in Iraq has led Iran’s leaders to conclude that the leading Western power has been weakened to the point that it is dependent on Iran’s goodwill, and that high oil prices have made the West all the more wary of a serious confrontation.
The Iranian regime’s analysis might prove a dangerous miscalculation, because it is likely to lead sooner rather than later to a “hot” confrontation that Iran simply cannot win.
After all, the issue at the heart of this conflict is this: who dominates the Middle East – Iran or the United States?
Iran’s leaders underestimate the explosive nature of this issue, and how it is answered, for the US as a global power and thus for its own future.
Nor, however, is the debate about the military option – the destruction of Iran’s nuclear program through US air strikes – conducive to resolving the issue.
Rather, it rings of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
